<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that relaxed the minimum size requirement to 35/16 inches in diameter (size 56) for domestic shipments
of Florida red seedless grapefruit and for red seedless grapefruit imported into the United States. This rule enables
handlers in Florida and importers to continue to ship size 56 red seedless grapefruit for the entire 1993&hyph;94
season.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 [7 CFR part 905] regulating the handling
of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act which provides that whenever specified commodities, including
grapefruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United States are
prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements as those in effect
for the domestically produced commodities. Section 8e also provides that whenever two or more marketing orders regulate
the same commodity produced in different areas of the United States, the Secretary shall determine which area the
imported commodity is in most direct competition with and apply regulations based on that area to the imported commodity.
The Secretary has determined that grapefruit imported into the United States are in most direct competition with
grapefruit grown in Florida regulated under Marketing Order No. 905, and has found that the minimum grade and size
requirements for imported grapefruit should be the same as those established for grapefruit under Marketing Order
No. 905. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 producers of these citrus fruits in Florida. There are
approximately 25 importers of grapefruit subject to the grapefruit import regulation. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000.
A minority of these handlers and a majority of the producers and importers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes an interim final rule that relaxed the minimum size requirement for domestic shipments of Florida
red seedless grapefruit to 35/16 inches in diameter (size 56) through November 6, 1994. This rule will enable handlers
to continue to ship size 56 red seedless grapefruit for the entire 1993&hyph;94 season. The interim final rule was
published in the November 12, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 59931], and provided 30 days for interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 905.306 [7 CFR 905.306] specifies minimum grade and size requirements for different varieties of fresh Florida
grapefruit. Such requirements for domestic shipments are specified in &sect;905.306 in Table I of paragraph (a),
and for export shipments in Table II of paragraph (b). Export requirements were not changed by the interim final rule
for Florida grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Citrus Administrative Committee (committee) met September 28, 1993, and unanimously recommended that the minimum
size requirement for domestic shipments of fresh red seedless grapefruit be relaxed. The committee meets prior to
and during each season to review the handling regulations effective on a continuous basis for each citrus fruit regulated
under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these
meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other
sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the handling regulations would tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reports that it expects that the fresh market demand will be sufficient to permit the shipment of size
56 red seedless grapefruit grown in Florida during the entire 1993&hyph;94 season. The committee also expects that
the overall external quality of the fruit will be good. The committee also expects that more Florida red seedless grapefruit
will be shipped fresh this season than last season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is designed to enable Florida grapefruit shippers to continue shipping size 56 red seedless grapefruit
to the domestic market consistent with current and anticipated strong demand in those markets during the entire 1993&hyph;94
season, and to maximize shipments to fresh market channels. This rule is based on the committee's assessment of the
maturity, flavor level, and size composition of this season's Florida red seedless grapefruit crop. The Florida
seedless grapefruit shipping season normally begins in September and continues until the following July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimum size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable size and maturity, thereby
maintaining consumer confidence in fresh Florida grapefruit. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes
to stable marketing conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is expected to increase
returns to Florida grapefruit growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the order for Florida citrus, handlers may ship up to 15 standard packed cartons (12 bushels) of fruit per day,
and gift packages which are individually addressed and not for resale, under exemption provisions. Fruit shipped
for animal feed is also exempt under specific conditions. In addition, fruit shipped to commercial processors for
conversion into canned or frozen products or into a beverage base are not subject to the handling requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also finalizes an interim final rule that relaxed the minimum size requirement for imported shipments of
red seedless grapefruit. The interim final rule was published in the November 12, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 59933], and provided 30 days for interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for grapefruit
under a domestic marketing order, imported grapefruit must meet the same or comparable requirements. The interim
final rule for Florida grapefruit relaxed the minimum size requirements for Florida red seedless grapefruit. Therefore
a corresponding change was needed in the grapefruit import regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimum grade and size requirements for grapefruit imported into the United States are currently in effect under
&sect;944.106 [7 CFR 944.106], as reinstated on July 26, 1993 [58 FR 39428, July 23, 1993]. The interim final rule for
imported grapefruit relaxed the minimum size requirements for imported red seedless grapefruit to 35/16 inches
in diameter (size 56) for the period November 8, 1993, through November 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the USTR has concurred with the issuance of this final rule as it pertains to
imported grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to relax the minimum size requirement
for red seedless grapefruit, as specified. The Department's view is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on
producers, handlers, and importers since it will permit Florida grapefruit handlers to continue to make available
those sizes of fruit needed to meet consumer needs consistent with this season's crop and market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

of winter pears grown in Oregon and Washington. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.

This final rule amendment has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, winter pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California are subject to assessments.
It is intended that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable pears handled during
the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year, which began July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994. This final rule amendment will not preempt

Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 90 handlers of winter pears regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
1,850 winter pear producers in Oregon, Washington, and California. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon, Washington, and California winter pear marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that
the assessment rates for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled from the beginning
of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration
of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and
producers of Oregon, Washington, and California winter pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with
the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate
budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons
have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rates recommended by the Committee are derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of pears. Because these rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will provide
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Winter Pear Control Committee met on June 4, and June 24, 1993, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,933,615
for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1992&hyph;93 fiscal year expense amount was $6,716,983, which
is $216,632 less than the recommended amount for this fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and a supplemental
assessment rate of $0.04 per standard box, or equivalent for Anjou variety pears. In comparison, the 1992&hyph;93
pear assessment rate was $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.09 for the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou
variety pears. This represents a $0.02 increase and $0.05 decrease, respectively, in the assessment rates recommended
for this fiscal year because the current rates should generate sufficient income to cover the increased expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year include $4,937,803 for advertising, $566,433 for contingency,
$422,826 for Ethoxyquin data research, and $174,775 for salaries and benefits. Comparable 1992&hyph;93 budgeted
expenses are $4,562,500, $490,578, $855,000, and $160,905, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee's approved 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expenses and assessment rates were adopted in a final rule and
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 54926, October 25, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 1, 1993, the Committee conducted a mail ballot and on a vote of 13 in favor and 1 opposed, recommended to increase
expenses to $7,931,925. This is a $998,310 increase in expenses from the previously approved 1993&hyph;94 budget.
No changes in the approved assessment rates were recommended because the current rates should generate sufficient
income to cover the increased expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase is deemed necessary by the Committee because the crop estimate, which is now approximated at 15,250,000
standard boxes of winter pears was underestimated by nearly 2 million boxes. Due to the larger crop, additional funding
in major categories is needed. This includes a total of $639,322 for contingency, $5,718,750 for paid advertising,
$305,000 for winter pear improvement, $305,000 for SOPP, and $484,000 for Ethoxyquin data research which represent
increases of $72,889, $780,947, $41,650; $41,650, and $61,174 respectively, from the previously approved budget.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action will not impose additional costs on handlers because the previously established assessment rates are
not being changed. Further, the increased expenses should benefit the industry by assisting in marketing a record-large
crop. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this final rule
amendment are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover
such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest
to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting this rule into effect and that
good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to conduct a more aggressive advertising and promotional
program to market the largest crop in the industry's history; (2) the marketing season is well underway and further
delays in authorizing this increase in expenditures would reduce the program's effectiveness; (3) handlers are
aware of this action and need no additional time to comply because the assessment rates are not being changed; (4) no
comments were received during the rulemaking proceeding to establish the assessment rates for the current fiscal
year which remain unchanged by this action; and (5) no useful purpose would be served by delaying this action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 932 [7 CFR part 932], as amended, regulating
the handling of olives grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, olives grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable olives handled during the 1994 fiscal year, beginning
January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 5 handlers of olives regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately 1,350
olive producers in California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. None of the handlers may be classified as small entities.
The majority of the producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year
apply to all assessable olives handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by
the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department
for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of California olives. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of olives. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Olive Committee met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $3,748,290,
for its 1994 budget. This is $928,530 more in expenses than the previous year. The increase is primarily due to additional
funding for market development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $27.21 per ton for the 1994 fiscal year, which is
$1.46 more in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments
of 101,000 tons, would yield $2,748,210 in assessment income. This, along with approximately $1,000,000 from the
Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $1,150,000 for the market expansion program, $990,860
for consumer affairs, and $173,730 for salaries. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $300,000
will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal year for the Committee began January 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable olives handled during the fiscal year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (4) this interim
final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization
of this action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 955 (7 CFR part 955), regulating the handling of Vidalia
onions grown in Georgia. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12788, Civil Justice Reform. This rule increases the level
of authorized expenditures for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period which began September 16, 1993, and ends September
15, 1994. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 250 producers of Georgia Vidalia onions under this marketing order, and approximately 145
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Vidalia onion producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of increased expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period was prepared by the Vidalia Onion Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Vidalia onions. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee met July 22, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $262,950, which included $82,500
for marketing. An interim final rule implementing that recommendation was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47023) and finalized on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64103).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee subsequently met on February 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended an increase of $18,000 in its 1993&hyph;94
budget for the construction and purchase of a new trade show booth. The trade show booth is expected to cost $27,000
and will be used in conjunction with the Committee's Vidalia onion promotional efforts. The Committee recommended
that $9,000 of current budget money be used and that the remaining $18,000 be taken from the authorized reserve, increasing
marketing expenses from $82,500 to $100,500, and increasing the total budget from $262,950 to $280,950. The reserve,
which currently totals $187,766, is within the maximum permitted by the order of three fiscal periods' expenses.
There are adequate funds to cover this new expenditure, so no increase in the assessment rate was recommended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no increase in the assessment rate is being recommended, no additional costs will be imposed on handlers. Therefore,
the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting
this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) The fiscal period began on September 16, 1993, and the Committee needs to have approval to pay its expenses
which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended
by the Committee at a public meeting; and (3) no increase in the assessment rate is being recommended so no additional
funds will need to be collected from handlers.

 This interim final rule invites comments on the establishment of final free and reserve percentages for 1993 crop
Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. The percentages are 74 percent free and 26 percent reserve. These percentages
are intended to stabilize supplies and prices and to help counter the destabilizing effects of the burdensome oversupply
situation facing the raisin industry. This rule was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee
(Committee), the body which locally administers the marketing order.

 This interim final rule is issued under marketing agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), both as amended, regulating
the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter
referred to as the ``Act.''

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, final free and reserve percentages may be established for raisins acquired by handlers
during the crop year. This rule establishes final free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless
raisins for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year, beginning August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will
not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 25 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order prescribes procedures for computing trade demands and preliminary and final percentages that establish
the amount of raisins that can be marketed throughout the season. The regulations apply to all handlers of California
raisins. Raisins in the free percentage category may be shipped immediately to any market, while reserve raisins
must be held by handlers in a reserve pool for the account of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration
of the order. Under the order, reserve raisins may be: Sold at a later date by the Committee to handlers for free use;
used in diversion programs; exported to authorized countries; carried over as a hedge against a short crop the following
year; or disposed of in other outlets noncompetitive with those for free tonnage raisins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this rule may restrict the amount of Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sun-dried) Seedless raisins that enter domestic markets, final free and reserve percentages are intended to lessen
the impact of the oversupply situation facing the industry and promote stronger marketing conditions, thus stabilizing
prices and supplies and improving grower returns. In addition to the quantity of raisins released under the preliminary
percentages and the final percentages, the order specifies methods to make available additional raisins to handlers
by requiring sales of reserve pool raisins for use as free tonnage raisins under ``10 plus 10'' offers, and authorizing
sales of reserve raisins under certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' specifies that 110 percent
of recent years' sales should be made available to primary markets each season before recommendations for volume
regulation are approved. This goal is met by the establishment of a final percentage which releases 100 percent of
the computed trade demand and the additional release of reserve raisins to handlers under ``10 plus 10'' offers. The
``10 plus 10'' offers are two simultaneous offers of reserve pool raisins which are made available to handlers each
season. For each such offer, a quantity of raisins equal to 10 percent of the prior year's shipments is made available
for free use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;989.54(a) of the order, the Committee which is responsible for local administration of the order,
met on August 16, 1993, to review shipment and inventory data, and other matters relating to the supplies of raisins
of all varietal types. The Committee computed a trade demand for each varietal type for which a free tonnage percentage
might be recommended. The trade demand is 90 percent of the prior year's shipments of free tonnage and reserve tonnage
raisins sold for free use for each varietal type into all market outlets, adjusted by subtracting the carryin of each
varietal type on August 1 of the current crop year and by adding to the trade demand the desirable carryout for each varietal
type at the end of that crop year. As specified in &sect;989.154, the desirable carryout for each varietal type shall
be equal to the shipments of free tonnage raisins of the prior crop year during the months of August, September, and
one half of October. If the prior year's shipments are limited because of crop conditions, the total shipments during
that period of time during one of the three years preceding the prior crop year may be used. In accordance with these
provisions, the Committee computed and announced a 1993&hyph;94 trade demand of 282,909 tons for Natural (sun-dried)
Seedless raisins.

As required under &sect;989.54(b) of the order, the Committee met on October 5, 1993, and computed and announced a
preliminary crop estimate and preliminary free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins
which released 85 percent of the trade demand since field prices had been established. The preliminary crop estimate
and preliminary free and reserve percentages were as follows: 387,947 tons, and 62 percent free and 38 percent reserve.
Also at that meeting, the Committee computed and announced preliminary crop estimates and preliminary free and reserve
percentages for Dipped Seedless, Oleate and Related Seedless, Golden Seedless, Zante Currant, Sultana, Muscat,
Monukka, and Other Seedless raisins. On November 15, 1993, the Committee decided that volume control percentages
only were warranted for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins, which would remain at 62 percent free and 38 percent
reserve. It determined that the supplies of the other varietal types would be less than or close enough to the computed
trade demands for each of these varietals or could be substituted to relieve anticipated shortages in some size ranges
of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins used for baking. In view of these factors, volume control percentages would
not be necessary to maintain market stability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;989.54(c), the Committee may adopt interim free and reserve percentages. Interim percentages
may release less than the computed trade demand for each varietal type. Interim percentages for Natural (sun-dried)
Seedless raisins of 73.75 percent free and 26.25 percent reserve were computed and announced on January 13, 1994.
That action released most, but not all the computed trade demand for Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sun-dried) Seedless raisins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;989.54(d) of the order, the Committee is required to recommend to the Secretary, no later than February
15 of each crop year, final free and reserve percentages which, when applied to the final production estimate of a varietal
type, will tend to release the full trade demand for any varietal type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee's final estimate of 1993&hyph;94 production of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins is 384,501 tons.
Dividing the computed trade demand of 282,909 tons by the final estimate of production results in a final free percentage
of 74 percent and a final reserve percentage of 26 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's recommendations and other
information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that upon good cause it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the

 because: (1) The relevant provisions of this part require that the percentages designated herein for the 1993&hyph;94
crop year apply to all Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins acquired from the beginning of that crop year; (2) handlers
are currently marketing 1993&hyph;94 crop raisins of the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless varietal type and this action
should be taken promptly to achieve the intended purpose of making the full trade demand quantity computed by the Committee
available to handlers; (3) handlers are aware of this action, which was recommended by the Committee at an open meeting,
and need no additional time to comply with these percentages; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day period
for written comments and all comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this interim final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the brucellosis indemnity regulations to provide for payment at fair market value for whole herds
of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. This action is necessary to eliminate in an expeditious manner all swine
herds known to be affected with brucellosis. This action will also help ensure that swine brucellosis is eradicated
in the United States within the next 5 years, thus saving the Federal government millions of dollars in program costs.
This action will also help eliminate the human health risk associated with swine brucellosis. We are also amending
the regulations concerning interstate movement of swine to require that all brucellosis-exposed swine from herds
known to be affected with the disease be identified with an eartag before being moved interstate from the herd. This
action will allow all handlers of swine to take precautions in handling swine potentially infected with brucellosis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease of swine, cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused
by bacteria of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Brucellosis in swine is characterized by abortion, infertility, orchitis, posterior paralysis, and lameness.
To help prevent the spread of the disease, and to further its eradication, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 provide for
payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity
is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive for promptly destroying animals infected with or exposed
to brucellosis. Because the continued presence of brucellosis in a herd seriously threatens the health of animals
in that herd and possibly other herds, the prompt destruction of brucellosis-affected swine is critical if brucellosis
eradication efforts in the United States are to succeed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations in &sect;51.3(b)(2) prior to the effective date of this interim rule, indemnity payments for
herd depopulation were made only for breeding swine destroyed because of brucellosis, and were based on a maximum
``per head'' rate of $150 per head for registered, inbred, or hybrid swine, and $65 per head for all other breeding swine.
In this interim rule, we are amending the regulations to provide that in the case of whole herd depopulation of swine,
indemnity payments shall be paid for all swine in the herd, not just for breeding swine, and at a fair market value determined
by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), based on an appraisal conducted by
an independent appraiser assigned by the Administrator, except that indemnity payments, plus any salvage, must
not exceed the appraised value of each animal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because brucellosis is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, swine other than breeding swine have not been
considered to be significantly at risk for transmitting brucellosis to other swine. Consequently, indemnity has
not been paid for ``feeder'' or ``finishing'' pigs. Recently, however, the infection of 30 humans with brucellosis
through the handling of swine other than breeding swine at a packing plant in North Carolina has indicated that such
swine do pose a significant risk of transmitting brucellosis to swine and humans.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the occurrence of brucellosis among workers at the packing plant, the State of North Carolina has ordered
that the plant may obtain swine only from validated brucellosis-free States, or from validated brucellosis-free
herds in States other than validated brucellosis-free States. Although, at this time, the infection of humans and
the North Carolina order involve only one packing plant, if the problem were to broaden and occur at other packing plants
in North Carolina, or to occur in additional States, additional individuals could suffer significant hardship from
brucellosis infections, and packing plants and owners of herds other than validated brucellosis-free herds could
experience severe economic disruption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Animal Health Association (USAHA), a nationwide association of State veterinarians and industry
members, recently passed a resolution requesting that the Department establish the goal of the complete eradication
of swine brucellosis in the United States by the end of 1996. This resolution was supported by the National Pork Producers
Council (NPPC) and the American Meat Institute (AMI). Additionally, the USAHA passed a second resolution, supported
by NPPC and AMI, requesting that the Department move to depopulate immediately all herds of swine known to be affected
with brucellosis by paying fair market value for all swine in the affected herds. (Under &sect;51.1, a herd known to
be affected is defined as any herd in which any animal has been classified as a brucellosis reactor and which has not
been released from quarantine.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We compared the probable outcome of following the USAHA resolutions with that of continuing the existing eradication
program, and concluded that eradication of swine brucellosis can be accomplished more quickly, with significantly
less expense, by beginning now to pay fair market value for whole herd depopulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change in the indemnity regulations is warranted now due to the success of the existing swine brucellosis eradication
program. During the life of the program, the prevalence of swine brucellosis has been reduced from 15 percent of the
nation's swine herds to 0.014 percent. Currently, only 34 herds nationwide are known to be affected with brucellosis.
Because the number of herds known to be affected is small, paying fair market value for whole herd depopulation is feasible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When undertaking whole herd depopulation, herd owners, where it is possible, will be required either to dispose of
the swine through means other than slaughter (e.g., through burial, incineration, rendering, etc.) on the premises
where the animals are held or penned at the time the indemnity is approved, or to move their swine for disposal to another
location when movement to the location is approved, in advance, by an APHIS representative. Paying fair market value
for whole herd depopulation, as provided for in this interim rule, will enable herd owners to dispose of swine through
means other than slaughter (e.g., through burial, incineration, rendering, etc.). (The flat rates provided for
under the existing regulations assume that the herd owner will also receive salvage value at slaughter.) Disposing
of swine through such alternate means will help eliminate the danger of spreading brucellosis to swine, as well as
help protect packing plant workers from the danger posed by brucellosis-infected swine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the effective date of this interim rule, &sect;51.6 of the regulations required that swine for which indemnity
was paid under the regulations be slaughtered at a slaughtering establishment. In order to allow for alternative
means of destruction, we are amending &sect;51.6(c) in this interim rule to provide that in the case of indemnity paid
for whole herd depopulation, swine may be destroyed on the premises where the animals are held or penned at the time
the indemnity is approved, or may be moved for destruction to another location when movement to the location is approved
in advance by an APHIS representative. We are also providing that in cases where the swine are destroyed other than
at a slaughtering establishment, the carcasses of the swine shall be disposed of by burial, incineration, or other
disposal means authorized by applicable State law, and are requiring that destruction and disposition of animals
destroyed other than at a slaughtering establishment be performed in the presence of an APHIS representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, in paying fair market value for whole herd indemnity, every effort will be made to dispose of swine by
means other than slaughter. In some cases, however, when a packing plant is willing to handle swine from herds known
to be affected, when it has been notified of the arrival of the swine, and when appropriate precautions are taken to
protect the plant's workers, slaughter may be a feasible means of disposing of the animals. As noted above, in such
cases, the indemnity paid, plus any salvage, must not exceed the appraised value of the swine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although, under the provisions of this interim rule, average indemnity costs for the Federal government will increase
from $1,760 per herd to $9,030 per herd, the total cost for indemnity is expected to increase only slightly over the
life of the program, and total program costs are expected to decrease substantially. According to APHIS projections,
the eradication program as provided for prior to this interim rule would have required over 30 more years to accomplish
total eradication, with projected costs of almost $600,000 for indemnity and $18 million for surveillance. In contrast,
because the provisions of this interim rule will allow for the quick depopulation of herds known to be affected with
brucellosis, and therefore increase program effectiveness, total eradication is expected to be accomplished in
5 years, with projected costs of $850,000 for indemnity and $10.5 million for surveillance. Thus, the total cost of
eradication will be reduced from $18.6 million to $11.35 million, and the time necessary to achieve eradication shortened
by more than 25 years.

Identification of Exposed Swine From Herds Affected With Brucellosis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 govern, among other things, the interstate movement of swine affected with brucellosis.
Under these regulations, the interstate movement of brucellosis reactor swine and exposed swine is subject to certain
restrictions. Among the restrictions on the movement of reactor swine is the requirement that such swine be individually
identified by attaching to the left ear a metal tag bearing a serial number and the inscription, ``U.S. Reactor,''
or a metal tag bearing a serial number designated by the State animal health official for identifying brucellosis
reactors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although part 78 does require that exposed swine moved interstate be accompanied by a permit, it does not require that
exposed swine from a herd known to be affected with brucellosis be identified with a metal eartag. However, because
some swine originating in a herd known to be affected are likely to be the offspring of infected sows, and because the
swine in the herd may be in extended contact with infected swine, they are at increased risk of being infected with brucellosis.
Because of this increased risk, we consider it necessary to provide that such swine can be readily identified prior
to slaughter. In order to better monitor the movement of exposed swine to ensure that they are destroyed and are not
diverted into herds not affected with brucellosis, we are amending &sect;78.32 to require that exposed swine from
a herd known to be affected with brucellosis may be moved interstate from the herd only if identified in the same manner
as reactor swine. This identification will facilitate the monitoring of such swine until they are slaughtered, thus
protecting against the spread of brucellosis by such animals. An additional benefit of such identification is that
it will alert packing plants to the arrival of reactor swine, allowing them to take appropriate handling precautions.

Immediate Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to eliminate a public
health risk, avert a potentially serious economic impact on swine marketing, reduce government expenses, and significantly
shorten the time necessary for the eradication of swine brucellosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule provides for indemnity payment for whole herd depopulation of swine herds known to be affected with
brucellosis. Prior to the effective date of this interim rule, indemnity for herd depopulation was paid only for breeding
swine infected with or exposed to the disease, and was based on a maximum ``per head'' rate of $150 per head for registered,
inbred, or hybrid swine, and $65 per head for all other breeding swine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present 34 swine herds in the United States are known to be affected with brucellosis. This number represents 0.014
percent of the 235,840 swine herds in this country. Of the 34 herds, 18 are in Florida and 12 are in Texas. Louisiana,
Mississippi, South Carolina, and Oklahoma have 1 each. The 34 herds known to be affected are all independently owned,
and all of the farmers are considered ``small entities'' (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according
to Small Business Administration size standards).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APHIS cannot require that farmers depopulate their herds, so it is impossible to determine exactly how many owners
will accept indemnity for whole herd depopulation. Because several herds are in the final stages of brucellosis ``cleanup,''
these farmers may not choose to depopulate their entire herds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of this writing, current market values for the different classes of swine are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sows, $160; boars, $150; gilts, $160; feeder pigs, $100; and suckling pigs, $20.

If owners choose to depopulate their entire herds, under the regulations they could start new operations with a more
productive swine herd after a standard minimum of 30 days of ``downtime'' for elimination of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule also requires that all exposed swine in a herd known to be affected with brucellosis must be identified
with a metal eartag before being moved interstate from the herd known to be affected. We estimate that the cost of applying
eartags to exposed swine in the average herd known to be affected will be less than $50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are declaring the Republic of Korea free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. There have been no outbreaks
of foot-and-mouth disease in the Republic of Korea since 1934, and we have determined that rinderpest has never existed
there. We are also adding the Republic of Korea to a list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and
foot-and-mouth disease, are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products
into the United States. This revision will remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from
the Republic of Korea, of live ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and will relieve restrictions
on the importation, from the Republic of Korea, of milk and milk products from ruminants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Republic of Korea is not declared to be free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. Therefore, the importation
from the Republic of Korea of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine will continue to be restricted because
of these diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also adding the Republic of Korea to the list of countries whose importation into the United States of llamas
and alpacas is restricted.

including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever,
hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease. These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants
and swine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except
those listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of these diseases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also proposed to add the Republic of Korea to the list in &sect;94.11(a) of countries declared free of rinderpest
and FMD that are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, we proposed to add the Republic of Korea to the list in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;94.1(d)(1) of countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist and that were declared free of rinderpest
and FMD on or after September 28, 1990. All countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990,
must be added to this list. The importation or entry of llamas and alpacas into the United States from countries on this
list is prohibited, unless the llamas or alpacas are imported through the Harry S Truman Animal Import Center in accordance
with 9 CFR 92.435. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending January 31, 1994. We did not receive
any comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule.

Effective Date:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from the Republic of Korea, of ruminants
and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation, from the Republic
of Korea, of milk and milk products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure
that Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change
in the regulations. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined
that this rule should be made effective 15 days after publication in the

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule adds the Republic of Korea to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth
disease. This action relieves restrictions imposed on the importation of live ruminants and fresh, chilled, and
frozen meat of ruminants from the Republic of Korea into the United States. This action does not relieve restrictions
on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine because the Republic of Korea is still
considered to be affected with hog cholera and swine vesicular disease.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of fresh, chilled,
or frozen meat of ruminants from the Republic of Korea into the United States as a result of this rule. In 1992, the United
States did not import any live ruminants or swine from the Republic of Korea. Additionally, only 2 metric tons of meat
and meat products were shipped from the Republic of Korea to the United States. This accounted for less than one-tenth
of one percent of total 1992 meat imports. The Republic of Korea is currently an importer of beef and lamb and does not
produce enough ruminant meat to be self-sufficient. Therefore, any effect on domestic prices or supplies will be
insignificant. Increases in imports of live ruminants from the Republic of Korea are also unlikely because there
is no demand in the United States for live ruminants from the Republic of Korea and because of high transportation costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 We are amending the regulations concerning importation of certain cured and dried pork and pork products from countries
where swine vesicular disease is known to exist, to allow the bones to be removed in the country where the pork or pork
products are processed. Prior to the effective date of this final rule, the regulations required that bones be removed
in the country where the swine are raised and slaughtered. This action will give processors an option as to where bones
are removed, while continuing to prevent the introduction of swine vesicular disease into the United States.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations in 9 CFR part 94 regulate, among other things, the importation of certain animals, meat, and animal products
into the United States. These regulations are designed to prevent the introduction into the United States of certain
diseases of livestock and poultry. Section 94.12 restricts the importation of pork and pork products into the United
States from countries where swine vesicular disease (SVD) is known to exist. In order to prevent the introduction
of this disease into the United States, only pork and pork products that meet conditions detailed in the regulations
are eligible for entry into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the effective date of this final rule, the regulations allowed swine to be raised and slaughtered in an SVD-free
country and the meat shipped to an SVD-infected country for curing and drying. However, if the resulting cured and
dried pork or pork products were to be imported into the United States, all bones had to be removed in the country of origin,
that is, the country where the swine were raised and slaughtered. The bones could not be removed in the country where
the pork or pork products were cured and dried. (See &sect;94.12(b)(1)(iv)(A).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60146&hyph;60147, Docket No. 93&hyph;102&hyph;1) a proposal to amend &sect;94.12(b)(1)(iv)(A) of the regulations
to allow the option of removing the bones in the country where the pork and pork products are cured and dried. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending January 14, 1994. We received one
comment by that date. It was from a veterinary medical association, and was in favor of the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, Germany is the only country where SVD is considered to exist that exports these cured and dried pork and
pork products to the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. During 1989, approximately 17,987 kilograms of cured and dried pork and pork products were exported from
Germany to the United States. The value of these imports totaled $113,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three facilities in Germany currently process cured and dried pork and pork products for the United States market.
The regulatory amendments made final in this document will allow these processing facilities to purchase pork from
SVD-free countries with the bones in, and remove the bones at the processing facilities in Germany. The amendments
will not have any impact on the domestic pork industry, which is valued in excess of $4 billion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the application
of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination,
to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of such cuts. Use of these substances will
result in the preservation of a fresh color and appearance throughout the product's microbiological shelf life.
This action is in response to petitions submitted by Wilson Foods Corporation. In addition, FSIS is amending the regulations
to clarify the permitted use and levels of such substances on fresh pork cuts, and revise the purpose of these substances
from ``to maintain color'' to ``to delay discoloration'' for clarification. Preserving the fresh color and appearance
of beef and lamb cuts increases the marketability of such products; therefore, losses to manufacturers due to color
deterioration will be reduced. In addition, FSIS is removing and reserving 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37), which requires qualifying
statements on fresh pork cuts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing any marking, labeling, packing, or ingredient
requirement on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under
FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdictions over meat products that are
outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded
or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their
entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State inspected products and establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. There are no applicable administrative procedures that must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Effect on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator, FSIS, has made a determination that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule allows the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid,
citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh
lamb cuts to delay discoloration. This final rule will impose no new requirements on small entities. Current regulations
already allow these substances to be applied to the surface of fresh pork cuts. Currently, approximately 20 percent
to 25 percent of meat packaging companies are producing red meat cuts. FSIS estimates that less than 3 percent of these
companies will be affected by this final rule. Also, the Agency estimates the cost of applying these substances to
the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts is between $.03 and $.04 per pound. However, if production of fresh
beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts treated in this manner increases and a sustained market develops for these products, the
cost will decrease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meat industry will benefit from this final action because the preservation of the fresh color and appearance of
beef cuts and lamb cuts for a longer period of time should increase the marketability of these products, thereby reducing
the losses to manufacturers due to color deterioration of beef cuts and lamb cuts. Manufacturers, both large and small,
opting to use such substances will be required to revise the ingredients statement on product labels to show the presence
of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and/or sodium citrate. However, the use of these
substances will be voluntary, and any costs associated with new label applications will be covered under existing
approved paperwork requirements of FSIS's prior label approval system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers choosing to apply ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate,
singly or in combination, to fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts will be required to develop and maintain an approved
partial quality control (PQC) program, and would thus incur expenses associated with maintaining the PQC program.
Decisions by individual manufacturers on whether to use such substances on the surface of fresh beef and fresh lamb
cuts will be based on their conclusions that the benefits will outweigh the costs of maintaining the required PQC program.
Current regulations already require manufacturers of fresh pork cuts using those substances to develop and maintain
an approved PQC program.

receive, evaluate, and either approve or disapprove requests for such PQC programs. The PQC program will be placed
on file in the establishment, and be available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary. The information
collection requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under
approval number 0583&hyph;0087.

Wilson Foods Petitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 13, 1988, and October 24, 1991, Wilson Foods Corporation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, submitted petitions,
along with supporting technical data, to FSIS to permit the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium
ascorbate, citric acid and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts to delay
discoloration of the meat cuts.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The intended effect of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, and sodium ascorbate is to serve as antioxidants; the intended
effect of citric acid and sodium citrate is to serve as sequestrants. The petitioner's data demonstrate that the required
amount to accomplish the intended effects, singly or in combination, would be at levels not to exceed 500 ppm or 1.8
milligrams (mg) per square inch of the product's surface of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, or sodium ascorbate,
and/or not to exceed 250 ppm or 0.9 mg per square inch of the product's surface of citric acid or sodium citrate. The data
submitted by the petitioner were the results of experiments on products which were packaged in a modified atmosphere
of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is the Agency's understanding that the benefits provided by the addition
of these substances occur regardless of packaging conditions. However, this rulemaking concerns the addition of
substances, rather than packaging gases, which are not a part of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The petitioner's data further demonstrate that such treatments result in delaying undesirable discoloration of
the product for a period of time that does not exceed the product's microbiological shelf life. Fresh beef cuts and
fresh lamb cuts treated with the substances mentioned above and stored at refrigerator temperature will remain wholesome
for up to 21 days. Loss of the ``fresh'' color and marketability of beef cuts and lamb cuts occurs before the product
becomes microbiologically unsafe. Some consumers are reluctant to purchase fresh beef or lamb cuts because of the
change to a darker color of the product before spoilage.

Current Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7(c)(4)) allows the use of ascorbic acid,
erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate on fresh pork cuts to maintain color at levels
not to exceed either 500 ppm or 1.8 mg/sq inch of surface of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid or sodium ascorbate, singly
or in combination, and/or not to exceed either 250 ppm or 0.9 mg/sq inch of surface of citric acid or sodium citrate,
singly or in combination. In addition, 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4) requires the use of such substances under an approved PQC
program under 9 CFR 318.4(d) and (e). Section 317.8(b)(37) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 317.8(b)(37))
requires that when ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or
in combination, are added to fresh pork cuts, there shall appear on the label of that product, in letters of the same
style and type and not less than one-fourth the size of letters in the product name, contiguous to the name of the product,
a statement identifying the specific approved substance(s) by its common name and the purpose for which it is added
such as ``Sprayed with a solution of water, ascorbic acid and citric acid to maintain color.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists ascorbic acid in 21 CFR 182.3013, erythorbic acid in 21 CFR 182.3041,
and sodium ascorbate in 21 CFR 182.3731 as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing
practices for use as preservatives. FDA lists citric acid in 21 CFR 182.6033 and sodium citrate in 21 CFR 182.6751 as
GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practices for use as sequestrants.

Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On October 4, 1993, FSIS published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 51581) to permit the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium
citrate, singly or in combination, to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of such
meat cuts. The proposed rule would allow these substances to be used, singly or in combination, at levels of not more
than 500 ppm or 1.8 milligrams per square inch of product surface area for ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid or sodium
ascorbate, and/or not more than 250 ppm or 0.9 milligrams per square inch of surface area for citric acid or sodium citrate
to achieve the intended technical effects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS also proposed that processors who apply these substances to cuts of fresh beef and lamb be required to follow an
approved PQC program as set forth in 9 CFR 318.4(d). Neither processing of such products nor distribution of such products
in commerce would be permitted until such PQC programs are approved and utilized according to the requirements set
forth in 9 CFR 318.4(e). All such PQC programs would cover certain critical control points, including: (1) The condition
of the meat before treatment (it must be fresh or previously frozen and maintained in a wholesome condition, evidenced
by time and temperature records from the point of slaughter), (2) solution formulation control, (3) single application
control, (4) finished product ingredient analysis monitoring, and (5) integrity of the packaging during storage,
transportation, and distribution. This would ensure that these substances applied to the surface of the meat cuts
to delay discoloration would not be applied in excessive amounts; therefore, the discoloration of the cuts would
occur before the onset of microbiological spoilage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cuts of fresh pork treated with ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, and citric acid
are currently required by 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37) to be labeled with a statement identifying these substances by their
common and usual name and the purpose for which they are used; e.g., ``Sprayed with a solution of water, ascorbic acid
and citric acid to maintain color.'' This statement is required to be shown on the label in a prominent manner, contiguous
to the product name, in letters of the same style and type and not less than one-fourth the size of the largest letter
in the product name. After reassessing its overall policy regarding prominent labeling, FSIS set forth in the proposed
rule that 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37) requiring qualifying statements on fresh pork cuts would be removed and reserved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, on November 4, 1992, the Agency published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proposed rule (57 FR 52596) to eliminate those prominent disclosure requirements for product name qualifiers where
the inclusion of a substance does not significantly alter the basic identity of the finished product or where the prominently
disclosed information can be found in the ingredients statement. Such rule, in part, would eliminate product name
qualifiers on fresh pork cuts treated with ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, and
citric acid. FSIS is considering the publication of a final rule on prominent labeling which would become effective
in the near future. FSIS believes that such action would not deprive consumers of informative labeling because all
substances used in the preparation of a product are required to be listed in the ingredients statement (9 CFR 317.2(f)(1)).
However, as indicated in the proposed rule on ascorbic acid and other substances, FSIS is removing and reserving 9
CFR 318.7(b)(37). Therefore, as of the effective date of this final rule, qualifying statements, which identify
the presence of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, and citric acid on fresh port cuts,
are no longer required on the labeling of fresh pork cuts which contain such substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS also stated in the preamble to the proposed rule that 9 CFR 317.8(b)(6) prohibits the word ``fresh'' on labels
to designate product which has been salted for preservation. Therefore, FSIS would not allow the word ``fresh'' to
be used on the labels of products treated with ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate,
and citric acid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS proposed to amend the table of approved substances in 9 CFR 318.7 by revising the current entry for the Class of
substance titled ``Miscellaneous,'' under the Substance column for ``Ascorbic, erythorbic acid, citric acid,
sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate'' to include such use on fresh beef and lamb cuts, along with the existing use
on fresh pork cuts. In addition, FSIS proposed that the entry be revised to clarify the permitted use and levels of such
substances on fresh pork cuts. The Agency also proposed to revise the purpose of these substances from ``to maintain
color'' to ``to delay discoloration'' for clarification.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS received three comments in response to the proposed rule. The comments were submitted by a consultant and two
food manufacturers. The commenters fully supported the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After review of the comments and other information, the Administrator has determined that the application of ascorbic
acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate to the surface of fresh beef and lamb cuts,
as permitted in the rule, will not render the products in which they are used adulterated or misbranded or otherwise
not in compliance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The Administrator has further determined that these substances
will be functional and suitable for the products and will be permitted for use on the surface of fresh beef and lamb cuts
as the lowest level necessary to accomplish the stated technical effect.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 29, 1993 (58 FR 50859), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (``NRC'' or ``Commission'') published a proposed
rule granting a petition for rulemaking submitted by a number of colleges and universities possessing NRC licenses.
The petition requested that the NRC reinstate the exemption from annual fees previously given nonprofit educational
licensees. The proposed rule requested public comment solely on that issue. The exemption had been eliminated in
a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 20, 1993. After careful consideration, the Commission has decided to reinstate the annual fee exemption for
nonprofit educational institutions.

Soon after publishing its final rule establishing the NRC's FY 1993 fee schedules (58 FR 38666; July 20, 1993), which
included for the first time annual fees for previously exempt nonprofit educational institutions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission received a petition for reconsideration of that rule. The petition, filed by a number of colleges
and universities affected by the policy change, requested that the NRC reconsider its decision to charge annual fees
to such institutions. The petition asserted that the externalized benefits and public good resulting from use of
university research reactors in various fields of education would be lost if these fees were imposed upon college
and university licensees. (See Petition for Reconsideration of Final Rule (July 30, 1993) (appended to the Proposed
Rule for the Restoration of the Annual Fee Exemption to Nonprofit Educational Institutions, 58 FR 50859; September
29, 1993.)) The petition pointed to research in such fields as nuclear safety, medicine, archaeology, food science
and textiles, education of the public in nuclear matters, and to various benefits of education.

The petition relied upon a letter from economist Alfred Kahn to counsel for Cornell University, a petition signatory.
The Kahn letter referred to ``pure knowledge,'' especially nonproprietary university research made accessible
to the public free of charge, as ``the archetypical `public good,' in economic terms, the essential characteristic
of which is that, once produced, it can be made available more and more widely at zero economic cost.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While considering whether to grant the petition for reconsideration, or in the alternative to grant some nonprofit
educational institutions individual ``public interest'' exemptions from the new annual fees, the NRC sent staff
members to a number of colleges and universities to learn more about the use of nuclear materials in educational programs
and the benefits that resulted from those materials' use. The Commission concluded, on the basis of these visits and
the arguments made in the petition for reconsideration, that it should propose to retract the new annual fees ($62,100
per research reactor license; lesser amounts for each materials license). Accordingly, on September 29, 1993 (58
FR 50859), the Commission published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice granting the petition and proposing to restore the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission received over 200 comments on the proposed rule, with the vast majority in favor of restoring the annual
fee exemption. (This number includes comments on the educational exemption provided to the Commission in response
to its Congressionally-mandated study of overall agency fee policy, see 58 FR 21116; April 14, 1993). After careful
review of the comments, and after studying the views of a professional economist engaged to assist in analyzing the
comments (see note 2 infra), the Commission has decided to make final its proposed reinstatement of the exemption
from annual fees for nonprofit educational institutions.

As the Commission made clear in the proposed rule, it will not charge other licensees retroactively for the monetary
shortfall produced by the Commission's change in policy on the educational exemption. Therefore, for FY 1993 no licensees
will be charged additional fees to compensate for the restored exemption. In addition, because the educational exemption
is being restored for FYs 1991&hyph;92, there will be no refunds to power reactor licensees who paid increased annual
fees in those years due to the exemption of nonprofit educational institutions (a point also detailed in the proposed
rule).

Comment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters were educational institutions, who argued that their educational and research activities with
licensed nuclear materials will have to be severely curtailed or halted altogether if the annual fee exemption is
not restored. They claimed that the annual fees would, in many cases, entirely subsume the budget for operation of
the research reactor or use of nuclear material. Many commenters also stated that there was no possibility of obtaining
more money for their operating budgets, and that the inevitable result of annual fees would therefore be an across-the-board
reduction in nuclear-related studies.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is aware of the effect annual fees could have on nonprofit educational institutions, not only from
their comments but also from its own site visits. The Commission believes that much of the work done by these institutions
with nuclear materials, in both nuclear and non-nuclear fields of study, is extremely valuable and should not be impeded
or halted due to the new annual fees. Further, for reasons discussed later, subsidies for such activities are both
necessary and desirable.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of comments received from nonprofit educational institutions stated that their work produced externalized
benefits to society, in the words used in the DC Circuit's Allied-Signal decision, ``not captured in tuition or other
market prices.'' Among the benefits cited were research in fields such as nuclear safety, neutron activation analysis,
neutron radiography, archaeology, art history and biology. Much of this research, some commenters claimed, was
basic research done to advance science, not for profit or commercial use (although such an outcome might occur). One
commenter noted that it does not accept research grants and contracts without making them public, and publishes virtually
all its findings. The commenters asserted that this research, if halted due to new fees, would not likely be duplicated
or replaced by the private sector.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with commenters that much of the work done with nuclear materials in academia, if halted, would
simply not be continued in the private sector. In particular, the Commission was impressed by the arguments made regarding
basic research. The Commission believes that such research, done in the spirit of academic inquiry, is an integral
part of the programs run by educational institutions with NRC licenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with commenters' arguments that educational institutions' commitment to basic research
is largely unique, as it is not driven by the need to develop commercial uses. While there is undoubtedly much basic
research performed outside educational institutions, the Commission does not believe that it is an adequate substitute
for academic research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Commission's view, a major benefit resulting from educational institutions' use of nuclear reactors and materials
is the production of new knowledge through research, which the Commission would term a ``public good,'' as defined
in economic theory.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two characteristics of a public good like pure knowledge are its nondepletability and nonexcludability. That is,
one person's acquisition of knowledge does not reduce the amount available to others; further, it is not efficient_and
often is impossible, as a practical matter_to prevent others from acquiring it. These characteristics make it difficult
to recoup the costs of producing pure knowledge. Because the value of a public good may be very great, but the costs of
producing it impossible to recapture, it may be necessary to subsidize that good's production for production to occur
at all. In the Commission's view, that is true of the pure knowledge produced by nonprofit educational institutions,
and the Commission has therefore decided to exempt them from fees.

The Commission's analysis of this concept was aided by a memorandum prepared by an NRC consultant on the issues of external
benefits and public goods. The memorandum has been placed in the NRC PDR and may be examined by any interested member
of the public. See Memorandum to NRC Staff from Stephen J.K. Walters, Professor of Economics, Loyola College (Md.),
dated January 4, 1994.

Restoring the educational exemption will have additional beneficial consequences. Colleges and universities
not only produce research results and pure knowledge (what we have termed ``public goods''), but also other benefits
of great value to both the nuclear community and society as a whole. For instance, many of the students trained on research
reactors will likely become the next generation of nuclear reactor operators and engineers. The knowledge they gain
from their education in these fields will allow them to operate reactors and other nuclear facilities safely and effectively.
Knowledge attained through education will also be of value to those companies or Government agencies, including
the armed forces, who hire these students to perform nuclear-related work, which often cannot be done without extensive
education in the area.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters argued, for a variety of reasons, that the educational exemption should not be restored. Some
commenters stated that each licensee should pay its fair share. Others believed that for-profit entities benefit
the public as well and should not be penalized because they generate profits. Certain nonprofit commenters and medical
licensees argued that if the exemption were retained, it should be expanded to include nonprofit institutions and
medical licensees that are not now exempted from fees. A few commenters stated that in certain fields of study, schools
and university hospitals compete with private research laboratories and nonprofit hospitals, respectively, and
thus would receive an unfair subsidy from an annual fee exemption. One commenter went on to argue that such a subsidy
amounted to an unlawful promotion of atomic energy by the NRC. Another commenter requested that the proposed rule
be changed to exempt it from the annual fee, noting that it was the only Federally-owned research reactor not so exempted,
due to the level of its power output. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of other commenters supported restoration of the educational exemption, but believed it should be funded
in a different manner. The two alternatives most popular with commenters were funding the exemption out of general
revenues, which would mean removing it from the fee base, or funding it via a surcharge on all licensees, not just power
reactor licensees. Those commenters favoring removal of the educational exemption from the fee base acknowledged
that such an outcome would require Congressional legislation.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After deliberating over whether the educational exemption should be restored, the Commission believes the wisest
policy decision is to exempt nonprofit educational licensees once again. Since the Commission published its final
rule in July 1993 abolishing the educational exemption, it has devoted an extraordinary amount of time and attention
to the question of whether to reverse that decision. It has reviewed hundreds of letters on the issue, fielded numerous
phone comments and inquiries, and sent staff members to study the issue by visiting college and university licensees.
In the Commission's view, the evidence taken as a whole leans strongly in favor of restoring that exemption, for the
reasons described above: that many educational licensees would be forced to halt their research and educational
activities due to lack of funds if NRC fee subsidies were withdrawn; that those activities would often not be continued
in the private sector, resulting in a serious loss of basic research in numerous areas of study; and that the public
good inherent in the production of knowledge made available to all is worthy of Government support. Such support would
not therefore constitute an unlawful subsidy or promotion of atomic energy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has received anecdotal information from some commenters indicating that certain nonprofit research
institutions (which do not fall within the definition of nonprofit educational institution as provided in 10 CFR
171.5) and Federally-owned research reactors should receive the same treatment as educational institutions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, the Commission does not believe it has sufficient information on which to base a generic exemption for such
research institutions and reactors. Because the proposed rule did not suggest that the educational exemption be
expanded in this way, the Commission received a smaller number of comments than are needed to make an informed decision
on this issue. For that reason, the current policy of charging such entities annual and user fees remains in effect.
Those nonprofit research institutions and Federally-owned research reactors who believe that they qualify for
an exemption from the annual fee based on the public good concept are, of course, free to request one from the Commission.
See 10 CFR 171.11. Depending on the outcome of any such requests, the Commission may need to revisit the question of
whether to make nonprofit research institutions generically exempt from fees in a future rulemaking.

Most Federally-owned research reactors were exempted from fees by Congress in earlier legislation. See section
6101(c)(4) of OBRA&hyph;90, 42 U.S.C. 2214(c), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, the reactor in
question operates at a power level greater than that specified in the legislation for exempt facilities, and therefore
does not meet the definition of a ``research reactor'' for purposes of the statutory exemption.

The Commission also believes that medical licensees should continue to pay annual fees. This is consistent with past
Commission practice. Contrary to some commenters' assertions, the Commission's fee policy does not result in a competitive
advantage for university medical licensees over nonprofit hospitals. Both are charged fees for licenses authorizing
medical treatment using licensed nuclear material.

Similarly, materials licenses held by nonprofit educational institutions which authorize remunerated services
or services performed under a Government contract are also subject to fees. See 10 CFR 170.11(a)(4) and 171.11(a)(1)
(1993).

While the Commission does not dispute that medicine provides significant benefits to patients, such treatment is
both depletable and excludable. The benefits of medicine are therefore a private rather than a public good. By contrast,
an educational institution generally disseminates the results of its basic research to all who want it, even going
beyond the confines of the university itself, without receiving compensation from any of those benefitting from
that knowledge. The key to nonprofit educational licensees' singular treatment is not merely that they provide valuable
social benefits; rather, it is the existence of certain market failure considerations (discussed above) that apply
to producers of pure knowledge through basic research, but not to medical practitioners. The distinction between
educational and medical licensees is addressed at greater length in the Commission's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission does not plan to adopt the suggestion of some commenters that most or all other licensees should contribute
something toward the costs of exempting nonprofit educational licensees. The agency, in any event, is not recouping
these costs for FY 1993, as it is legally precluded from retroactively collecting those costs from licensees. The
Commission in its Energy Policy Act-mandated review of fee policy has concluded that the costs of exempting nonprofit
educational institutions should be excluded from the fee base through legislation modifying OBRA&hyph;90. In its
study, the Commission concluded that if legislation to accomplish this is not enacted, these costs should continue
to be recovered through fees assessed to power reactor licensees.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters have argued that the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (``AEA''), mandates NRC support of
education, and that accordingly the NRC must restore the educational exemption to conform to that mandate. In this
regard, some commenters made the point that their facilities were originally funded or provided to them by the AEC
or other Federal agencies.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission acknowledges its longstanding policy of supporting education, and believes that such support has
been vital to the success of nuclear and nuclear-related education. That notwithstanding, the Commission does not
view its education policy, or the exhortatory language of the AEA, as mandating that colleges and universities be
exempt from NRC fees. The Commission has decided to restore the fee exemption as a policy matter, not a matter of legal
compulsion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many educational institutions commented that it made little sense to charge them annual fees when much of their nuclear-education
funding was derived from Federal agencies such as the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. Another
commenter argued that State agencies were nonprofit in nature and should be exempted in the same manner as colleges
and universities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission for reasons discussed above decided to reinstate the exemption for nonprofit educational institutions.
The fact that a number of these institutions received funding from Federal agencies was not a factor in the final decision.
The Commission's decision was based primarily on who received the benefits of the services rendered, rather than
who funded the underlying activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also notes that it charges fees to other governmental licensees, including both Federal and State
agencies. (Virtually no Federal agencies are charged user fees under part 170 due to a prohibition against such fees
in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, see 31 U.S.C. 9701.) It finds no basis for changing its historical policy
with respect to these entities in this rulemaking. This issue is addressed in the Commission's Report to Congress
on fee policy, cited earlier in this rulemaking.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some educational commenters stated that they should fall under the category of small entities, and asked whether
the definition of ``small entity'' could be broadened to include a greater number of institutions than currently
fall within the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission intends to re-examine the size standards it uses to define small entities within the context of compliance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Commission will conduct this review within the context of the proposed revisions
of small business size standards proposed by the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') (58 FR 46573; September
2, 1993). The Commission will not complete its review until the SBA promulgates a final rule containing the revised
size standards. Until these activities are completed, it would be premature to address this comment.

III. Final Action_Changes Included in Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made only one change to its FY 1993 final rule establishing annual and user fee schedules for that
fiscal year. As it proposed, the Commission has amended &sect;171.11 to exempt nonprofit educational institutions
from annual fees. The new exemption provision is identical to that contained in the FY 1991 and 1992 final fee rules.
Because the final fee schedule for FY 1993 has already been issued, the Commission will not be charging any other licensees
for the fees that would have been paid for FY 1993 by the newly exempt group of licensees. For that reason, no new fee schedule
is being published at this time. A revised NRC fee schedule incorporating these changes and billing other licensees
for the FY 1994 exemption's costs will be included in the FY 1994 proposed fee rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Commission has decided in this final rule to reinstate the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational
institutions, the NRC will cancel the FY 1993 annual fee invoices for those licensed activities exempt under this
final rule. Accordingly, refunds will be made to those licensees who paid the FY 1993 annual fees and are now exempt
under this final rule. Additionally, no further action will be taken on nonprofit educational institutions' exemption
requests, which had been held in abeyance pending this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some nonprofit educational institutions filed applications requesting termination, downgraded, possession-only
or combined licenses to avoid the FY 1993 annual fee. If those applications are still pending, the licensees should
notify the NRC within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this rule if they wish to rescind their applications
due to the exemption's reinstatement. Absent such notification, the NRC will process the applications as filed.
There are instances where the NRC has already completed final action on some of the applications in question. The affected
nonprofit educational institutions are advised that if they wish to reinstate their previous license authority,
they must file an application to do so with the NRC. Such applications for reinstatement of previous license authority
are exempted from fees under 10 CFR 170.11(a)(4) as appropriate.

Paragraph (a) of this section is amended by adding nonprofit educational institutions, as defined in &sect;171.5,

is found in Sections I and II of this final rule.

The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared for the
final regulation.

VII. Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to 10 CFR part 171, on November 5, 1990 the Congress passed Public Law No. 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA&hyph;90). OBRA&hyph;90, as amended, requires that for FYs 1991 through 1998 approximately
100 percent of the NRC's budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. To accomplish this statutory
requirement, on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the NRC, in accordance with &sect;171.13, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final amount of the FY 1993 annual fees for operating reactor licensees, fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees,
and holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed source and devices and QA program approvals,
and Government agencies. Consistent with OBRA&hyph;90 and its Conference Committee Report, the Commission has
ensured that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The annual fees are based on the Commission's FY 1993 budget of $540 million less the amounts collected from part
170 fees and the funds directly appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund to cover the NRC's high level waste program;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The annual fees, to the maximum extent practicable, have a reasonable relationship to the cost of regulatory services
provided by the Commission; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Annual fees are assessed to those licensees which the Commission, in its discretion, determines can fairly, equitably
and practicably contribute to their payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, when developing the annual fees for operating power reactors, the NRC continues to consider the various
reactor vendors, the types of containment, and the location of those reactors. The annual fees for fuel cycle licensees,
materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations and approvals and for licenses issued to Government
agencies take into account the type of facility or approval and the classes of the licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR part 171, which established annual fees for operating power reactors effective October 20, 1986 (51 FR 33224;

The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis
is not required for this final rule. The backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not require the
modification of or additions to systems, structures, components, or design of a facility or the design approval or
manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organization required to design, construct or operate
a facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some supplemental security income (SSI) recipients who were victims of Hurricane Andrew in south Florida have not
been able to replace or repair their damaged homes due to circumstances beyond their control. This means that some
SSI recipients will have resources (insurance money) in amounts that will disqualify them for SSI benefits if held
for periods exceeding the maximum 18-month period provided in regulations at &sect;416.1232. Since Hurricane Andrew
occurred in August 1992, some SSI recipients could become ineligible as early as March 1994. We are codifying in regulations,
interim final rules which provide additional time for victims of Hurricane Andrew to make arrangements to effect
repair or replacement of excluded property without interruption of their SSI benefits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew devastated south Florida causing damage estimated in excess of $18 billion. According
to published reports, of the 47,000 homes destroyed, 32,000 are still uninhabitable. Only 10 percent of 140,000 damaged
homes have been rebuilt or repaired because the number of contractors available to rebuild homes is steadily decreasing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We estimate that approximately 450 SSI recipients, who were victims of Hurricane Andrew, have received payments
from private insurance companies for the repair or replacement of their property, but because of the extent of the
devastation, they have not yet been able to repair or replace their homes and property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at &sect;416.1205(c) provide that SSI recipients can have no more than $2,000 in countable resources
and SSI couples can have no more than $3,000. The regulations at &sect;416.1237 provide that assistance received
under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or other assistance provided under a Federal statute because
of a catastrophe which is declared to be a major disaster by the President of the United States or comparable assistance
received from a State or local government, or from a disaster assistance organization, is excluded permanently under
&sect;416.1210 in determining countable resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at &sect;416.1232 complement the disaster assistance exclusion by providing that cash or in-kind
items for the repair or replacement of lost, stolen, or damaged excluded resources are not treated as resources for
9 months, plus one extension for a reasonable period up to an additional 9 months for good cause if circumstances do
not permit repair or replacement within the initial 9-month period and the individual intends to use the funds for
repair or replacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excluded resources generally include the individual's home, household goods and personal effects, and the automobile,
as are described in &sect;&sect;416.1212, 416.1216 and 416.1218 respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Private insurance payments do not qualify as disaster assistance and, therefore, cannot be permanently excluded.
For some of these SSI recipients, the maximum period of 18 months during which monies to repair or replace excluded
resources are not treated as resources is about to expire. Because of the vast devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew,
these individuals have not been able to rebuild or repair their homes. We estimate that, as early as March 1994, some
of these individuals will begin to lose SSI eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose interim final regulations to amend &sect;416.1232(b) for victims of Hurricane Andrew only, to extend
the maximum 18-month period during which cash or in-kind replacement received from any source for purposes of repairing
or replacing an excluded resource is not treated as a resource:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;For an additional 12 months as long as the individual intends to repair or replace the property and good cause
still exists for not yet having done so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations for the exclusion of monies to repair or replace an excluded resource have been adequate to cover
past situations, including other disasters. However, the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew was so extensive and
destroyed so much of the existing infrastructure (e.g., governmental and public services and utilities, construction
and repair industry and equipment, etc.) that the current maximum 18-month period, in this context, is not adequate.
Many SSI recipients hurt by Hurricane Andrew who have received insurance settlements have not been able to rebuild
or repair their homes or even contract for those services. Through this regulatory change, we are providing additional
time for victims of this extraordinary disaster to make arrangements to effect repair or replacement without interruption
in their SSI benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the extension period, we will make periodic contacts with each individual to determine whether the individual
still intends to repair or replace the property and, if so, whether good cause for not yet having done so still exists.
We will obtain evidence to make these determinations.

We are publishing these new SSI resource counting rules as interim final rules with a request for comments instead
of as proposed rules. The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy, generally follows the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its notice and comment procedures
when an agency finds that there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. After due consideration, we have determined that, under 5 U.S.C.
553(b)(B), good cause exists for waiver of notice of proposed rulemaking on these regulations because such procedures
would be contrary to the public interest. The process of notice and comment rulemaking generally requires many months
before culminating in a final rule. If SSI recipients who are victims of Hurricane Andrew do not receive the beneficial
effect of this rule by March 1994, some will lose their SSI eligibility. Since it is in the public interest that these
individuals continue to receive SSI benefits while they make arrangements to repair or replace their excluded resources
that have been damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, we believe that the public interest warrants immediate promulgation
of these rules. Accordingly, promulgation of these rules pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking would be contrary
to the public interest and thus may be dispensed with pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). However, we are asking the public
to comment on these interim final rules and will determine if these regulations need revision on consideration of
any comments received.

These interim final regulations do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of

These interim final regulations do not contain reporting requirements. However, they extend the initial regulation
that did. Inadvertently, we did not publish a narrative for that regulation concerning the need for clearance by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We would normally seek approval of the reporting requirements contained in
the initial regulation (under the Paperwork Reduction Act) from OMB. We are not doing so in this situation because

We expect that approximately 450 SSI recipients will be involved, and that it will take them an estimated five minutes
each to provide this information. The annual burden for this reporting requirement is estimated at 37.5 hours. The
respondents are SSI recipients who have excess countable resources as a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new bulk form of cefmetazole,
and (2) for its use in a new dosage form of cefmetazole sodium, cefmetazole sodium injection. The agency has concluded
that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its safety and
efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 442 to provide
for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Submitting Comments and Filing Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because, when effective, it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
April 18, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before April 18, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before April 18, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before May 16, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
These temporary regulations set forth certain changes made to the accuracy-related penalty in section 6662 of the
Internal Revenue Code (Code) by section 13251 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993). These
changes eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and raised
the disclosure standard for purposes of the penalties for disregarding rules or regulations (section 6662(b)(1)
of the Code) and a substantial understatement of income tax (section 6662(b)(2) of the Code) from ``not frivolous''
to ``reasonable basis.'' See section 13251 of OBRA 1993 and H. Rep. No. 213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 669 (1993) (the Conference
Report).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history to OBRA 1993 indicates that this ``reasonable basis'' standard is a relatively high standard
of tax reporting that is significantly higher than the ``not frivolous'' disclosure standard previously applicable
to taxpayers under section 6662 of the Code and currently applicable to preparers under section 6694 of the Code. See
Conference Report, at p.669. A position is not frivolous if it is not ``patently improper.'' See &sect;1.6694&hyph;2(c)(2)
of the Income Tax Regulations and current &sect;1.6662&hyph;3(b)(3). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 also
provides that the reasonable basis standard is not satisfied by a position that is merely arguable or merely a colorable
claim. See Conference Report, at p.669.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adopting the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy
to avoid the disregard and substantial understatement penalties, Congress adopted the new reasonable basis standard
as the standard that a return position must satisfy to avoid the negligence penalty. See Conference Report at p.669.

Explanation of Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1.6662&hyph;3(a) of the regulations generally provides that if any portion of an underpayment, as defined
in section 6664(a) of the Code and &sect;1.6664&hyph;2, of any income tax imposed under subtitle A of the Code that
is required to be shown on a return is attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, there is added
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion. Section 1.6662&hyph;3(b)(1) defines ``negligence'' to include
any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue laws or to exercise ordinary
and reasonable care in the preparation of a tax return. Currently, &sect;1.6662&hyph;3(c) generally provides that
no penalty under section 6662(b)(1) may be imposed on any portion of any underpayment that is attributable to negligence
or a position contrary to a rule or regulation if the position is adequately disclosed and is not frivolous, if the requirements
of that section are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.6662&hyph;4(a) of the regulations generally provides that if any portion of an underpayment of any income
tax imposed under subtitle A of the Code that is required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial understatement
of such income tax, there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion. Section 1.6662&hyph;4(a)
further provides that, except in the case of any item attributable to a tax shelter, an understatement is reduced by
the portion of the understatement that is attributable to positions for which there was substantial authority or
adequate disclosure. Currently, under &sect;1.6662&hyph;4(e)(2), this adequate disclosure exception will not
apply if the position on the return is frivolous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of OBRA 1993, the minimum standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy to avoid either the penalty
for disregarding rules or regulations or for a substantial understatement of income tax has been raised from ``not
frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis.'' In addition, there is no longer a disclosure exception for the negligence penalty
and, to avoid that penalty, the return position generally must satisfy the new reasonable basis standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules generally apply to returns that are due (without regard to extensions for filing) after December 31, 1993.
However, the rules relating to changes to the penalties for negligence or disregard of rules or regulations will not
apply to returns, including qualified amended returns, filed on or before March 14, 1994.

Special Analyses

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 8884; February 17, 1993), provided amendatory language revising the categories of vessels, by length, that
were subject to the Recreational Vessel Fee for calendar years 1993 and 1994. However, the Interim Final Rule also
contained incorrect amendatory language revising section 1.30&hyph;1 which caused the text of former paragraph
(c) and the introductory text of paragraph (d) of that section to be mistakenly deleted. Since the purpose of the rulemaking
was only to implement Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;587,
the amendatory language should have redesignated paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;1.30&hyph;1 as paragraphs (d)
and (e), respectively, rather than causing them to be deleted. This document revises 33 CFR 1.30&hyph;1 to redesignate
and restore the deleted text as it formerly appeared in the CFR.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1007(a)(2) of the Legal Services Corporation Act (``Act''), 42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(2), requires the Corporation
to establish maximum income levels for individuals eligible for legal assistance, and the Act provides that other
specified factors shall be taken into account along with income. Section 1611.3(b) of the Corporation's regulations
establishes a maximum income level equivalent to one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the official Federal
Poverty Income Guidelines.

Responsibility for revision of the official Federal Poverty Income Guidelines was shifted in 1982 from the Community
Services Administration to the Department of Health and Human Services. The revised figures for 1994 set out below
are equivalent to 125% of the current official Poverty Guidelines as set out at 58 FR 6277 (Feb. 10, 1994).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, at the request of Mel-Mike Enterprises, Inc., substitutes Channel 237C1 for Channel 237C2 at Central,
Mew Mexico, and modifies the license of Station KNUW to specify operation on the higher class channel. See 58 FR 5322,
January 21, 1993. Channel 237C1 can be allotted to Central in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation
requirements with a site restriction of 18.6 kilometers (11.6 miles) northwest, at coordinates North Latitude 32&hyph;52&hyph;15
and West Longitude 108&hyph;18&hyph;57, to accommodate petitioner's desired transmitter site and avoid short-spacings
to Stations KKRK, Channel 237A, Douglas, Arizona, and KLAQ, Channel 238C, El Paso, Texas. Mexican concurrence has
been received since Central is located within 320 kilometers (199 miles) of the U.S.-Mexican border. With this action,
this proceeding is terminated.

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclusive Economic Zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 672. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of
the GOA, was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 2,500 metric
tons (mt). The final 1994 groundfish specifications also closed the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the Western
Regulatory Area of the GOA under &sect;672.20(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), has determined that the
TAC of Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA is sufficient to allow a 48-hour directed fishery. Therefore,
NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA as of
12 noon A.l.t., March 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance
of 2,300 mt, with the remaining 200 mt to be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the area.
The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance will be attained by a 48-hour directed fishery
for Atka mackerel. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory
Area of the GOA, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 16, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a companion release, the Commission is proposing rule amendments that prohibit a broker, dealer or municipal securities
dealer from underwriting a municipal issue unless the issuer agrees to disseminate information to the secondary
market and from recommending the purchase of a municipal security without reviewing such information.

I. Executive Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recent high volume of municipal securities offerings, as well as the growing ownership of municipal securities
by individual investors, has highlighted the need for improved disclosure practices in the municipal securities
market, particularly in the secondary market. To encourage and expedite the ongoing efforts by market participants
to improve disclosure practices, and to assist market participants in meeting their obligations under the antifraud
provisions, the Commission is publishing its views with respect to disclosures under the federal securities laws
in the municipal market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretive release addresses the following:

subject to audit) and an explanation of the accounting principles followed in the preparation of the financial statements,
unless the statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') or
accompanied by a quantified explanation of any deviation from GAAP;

&bull;Timely delivery of preliminary official statements to underwriters and potential investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commission is renewing its recommendation for legislation to repeal the exemption for corporate obligations
underlying certain conduit securities from the registration and reporting requirements of the federal securities
laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Particularly because of their public nature, issuers in the municipal market routinely make public statements
and issue reports that can affect the market for their securities; without a mechanism for providing ongoing disclosures
to investors, these disclosures may cause the issuer to violate the antifraud provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basic mechanisms to address potential antifraud liability include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Publication of financial information, including audited financial statements and other financial and operating
information, on at least an annual basis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Timely reporting of material events reflecting upon the creditworthiness of the issuer or the obligor and
the terms of its securities, including material defaults, draws on reserves, adverse rating changes and receipt
of an adverse tax opinion; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submission of such information to an information repository. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Underwriters and municipal securities dealers are key players in maintaining the quality of disclosure in the
municipal securities markets. The underwriter has a duty to review the issuer's disclosure documents before offering,
selling or bidding for the securities and to have a reasonable basis for its belief as to the accuracy and completeness
of the representations in the documents. Municipal dealers must have a reasonable basis for recommending the purchase
of securities.

 the Commission is proposing for comment two related rule amendments, the first proposing to prohibit a broker, dealer
or municipal securities dealer from underwriting a municipal issue unless the issuer makes a commitment to provide
annual and event-related secondary market information to a designated repository; and the second proposing to prohibit
a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending purchases of such issues in the secondary market
if it does not review such information.

A. The Municipal Securities Market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As detailed in the recent Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market, the market for municipal securities is
characterized by great diversity and high volume. Issuers, estimated to number approximately 50,000, include state
governments, cities, towns, counties, and special subdivisions, such as special purpose districts and public authorities.
It is estimated that there currently are 1.3 million municipal issues outstanding, representing approximately
$1.2 trillion in securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1993, a record level of over $335 billion in municipal securities was sold, representing over 17,000 issues. This
record financing was heavily influenced by refundings. Nevertheless, the level of long term new money financings,
representing 49% of financings for the year, reflected continued growth. In 1993, there were $142 billion of new money
long term financings, compared to $81 billion in 1988, a 75% increase.

In recent years, the forms of securities used to meet the financing needs of these issuers have become increasingly
diverse and complex. For example, conduit bonds, certificates of participation, and a variety of derivative products
have joined traditional general obligation and revenue bonds as prevalent forms of municipal financing.

In addition, there has been a change in the investor profile in the municipal securities market. By 1992, individual
investors, including those holding through mutual funds, held 75% of the municipal debt outstanding, compared to
44% in 1983.

Along with the changing investor profile, there has been a change in investor strategy. Traditionally, municipal
bondholders have been buy and hold investors; however, this strategy has changed significantly with the growth and
development of municipal bond funds. Many of these funds actively trade their portfolio securities to take advantage
of market conditions or to meet redemption needs.

B. SEC Oversight of the Municipal Securities Market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the agency charged with administering the federal securities laws and overseeing this nation's securities markets,
the Commission has an obligation to protect investors in the municipal markets from fraud, including misleading
disclosures. As the New York City report stated nearly two decades ago:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
By virtue of the large dollar volume of municipal securities issued and outstanding each year, such securities are
a major factor in the Nation's economy and the national securities markets. In light of the national scope of the municipal
securities markets, there is an overriding federal interest in assuring that there is adequate disclosure of all
material information by issuers of municipal securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although municipalities have certain unique attributes by virtue of their political nature, insofar as they are
issuers of securities, they are subject to the proscription against false and misleading disclosures.

The burgeoning volume and complexity of municipal securities offerings, as well as the retail nature of the market,
heighten the need for market participants to seek to prevent fraud through the timely provision of material information
concerning municipal issuers and securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Congress exempted offerings of municipal securities from the registration requirements and civil liability
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and a mandated system of periodic reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it did not exempt transactions in municipal securities from the coverage of the antifraud provisions of section 17(a)
of the Securities Act,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b&hyph;5 promulgated thereunder.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These antifraud provisions prohibit any person, including municipal issuers and brokers, dealers and municipal
securities dealers, from making a false or misleading statement of material fact, or omitting any material facts
necessary to make statements made by that person not misleading, in connection with the offer, purchase or sale of
any security. In addition, brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers are subject to regulations adopted
by the Commission, including those regulations adopted to define and prevent fraud.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Municipal securities dealers are also subject to rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(``MSRB'').

In the absence of a statutory scheme for municipal securities registration and reporting, disclosure by municipal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

In 1989, the Commission adopted Rule 15c2&hyph;12 under the Exchange Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to enhance the quality and timeliness of disclosure to investors in municipal securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule requires that underwriters (both bank and non-bank) of primary offerings of municipal securities with an
aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more obtain and distribute to their customers the issuers' official
statements for the offerings. This mechanism provides underwriters an opportunity to review the issuer's disclosure
documents before commencing sales to investors.

There is a consensus that, over the last two decades, these market and regulatory efforts have improved significantly
the quality of primary offering disclosure in the municipal securities markets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nonetheless, there continue to be concerns with the adequacy of municipal offering disclosure, particularly with
respect to offerings of non-general obligation bonds and smaller issues.

Secondary market disclosure practices present greater concerns. Recent highly publicized defaults
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and refundings,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well as the tremendous level of issuances during the past two years, have heightened interest in municipal secondary
market disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PSA has testified that today ``secondary market information is difficult to come by even for professional municipal
credit analysts, to say nothing of retail investors.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Substantial issuer information, in the form of official statements, state-required reports, and other public documents,
is available from the approximately 20% of municipal issuers that come to market frequently, accounting for 80% of
the dollar volume of municipal securities issued.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, the remaining issuers, representing 20% in dollar volume but 80% in number, which come to the market much
less frequently, provide substantially less continuing information. Many of these issues are health care issues,
housing issues, industrial development bonds, and other conduit financings,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 financing sectors which have had the greatest incidence of defaults, both monetary and technical.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, information often is unavailable for smaller issues of securities of general purpose units of government
and the securities of special purpose districts and authorities.

In response to a request by Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt for a recommended ``market-participant sponsored
solution'' to the disclosure issues in the municipal securities market, on December 20, 1993, 12 groups and associations
representing a broad range of market participants submitted to the Commission a Joint Statement on Improvements
in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure (the ``Joint Statement'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Joint Statement sets forth ``a framework for improving the availability of information in the marketplace''
that calls for both continued market initiatives to improve issuer disclosure and ``support from the SEC and the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28

of municipal issues unless continuing information covenants are provided by the issuer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws prohibit fraudulent or deceptive practices in the offer
and sale of municipal securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disclosure documents used by municipal issuers, such as official statements, are subject to the prohibition against
false or misleading statements of material facts, including the omission of material facts necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The adequacy of the disclosure
provided in municipal security offering materials is tested against an objective standard: an omitted fact is material
if there is a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual
significance in the deliberations of the reasonable [investor]. Put another way, there must be a substantial likelihood
that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly
altered the ``total mix'' of information made available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the primary offering of municipal securities, the extensive voluntary guidelines issued by the Government Finance
Officers Association (``GFOA'') have received widespread acceptance and, among a number of larger issuers, have
been viewed as ``in essence obligatory rules.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other groups, including the National Federation of Municipal Analysts (``NFMA''), have published voluntary disclosure
guidelines covering industry specific sectors, including among others, housing, student loans, transportation
and health care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

The guidelines prepared by the GFOA and the NFMA provide a generally comprehensive roadmap for disclosure in offering
statements for municipal securities offerings. There are, however, areas that need further improvement in both
the context of negotiated and competitively bid underwritings. In addition, implementation of these guidelines
needs to be extended to the whole market. For example, while large repeat general obligation issuers usually have
comprehensive disclosure documents, small issuers and conduit issuers, particularly in the health care, housing
and industrial development areas, do not always provide the same quality of disclosure.

See NASACT Blue Ribbon Committee Report at 1&hyph;2; Staff Report at 26. Industry participants generally agreed

special district and industrial development revenue bonds.

C. Areas Where Improvement Is Needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Conflicts of Interest and Other Relationships or Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information concerning financial and business relationships and arrangements among the parties involved in the
issuance of municipal securities may be critical to an evaluation of an offering.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recent revelations about practices used in the municipal securities offering process have highlighted the potential
materiality of information concerning financial and business relationships, arrangements or practices, including
political contributions, that could influence municipal securities offerings. For example, such information
could indicate the existence of actual or potential conflicts of interest, breaches of duty, or less than arm's-length
transactions. Similarly, these matters may reflect upon the qualifications, level of diligence, and disinterestedness
of financial advisers, underwriters, experts and other participants in an offering. Failure to disclose material
information concerning such relationships, arrangements or practices may render misleading statements made in
connection with the process, including statements in the official statement about the use of proceeds, underwriters'
compensation and other expenses of the offering. In addition, investors reasonably expect participants in municipal
securities offerings to follow standards and procedures established by such participants, or other governing authorities,
to safeguard the integrity of the offering process; accordingly, material deviations from those procedures warrant
disclosure.

Beyond existing specific disclosure requirements and guidelines, the range of financial and business relationships,
arrangements and practices that need to be disclosed depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case.
If, for example, the issuer (or any person acting on its behalf) selects an underwriter, syndicate or selling group
member, expert, counsel or other party who has a direct or indirect (for example, through a consultant) financial
or business relationship or arrangement with persons connected with the offering process, that relationship or
arrangement may be material.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Areas of particular concern are undisclosed payments to obtain underwriting assignments and undisclosed agreements
or arrangements, including fee splitting, between financial advisers and underwriters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the adviser is hired to assist the issuer, such relationships, financial or otherwise, may divide loyalties. Similarly,
affiliations between sellers of property to be used in a financed project and conduit borrowers raise questions regarding,
among other things, the determination of fair market value of the property and self-dealing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evolution in the financial markets has led to increasingly complex and sophisticated derivative and other municipal
products. While these new products offer investors a wide range of investment alternatives, in choosing among the
alternatives, investors need a clear understanding of the terms and the particular risks arising from the nature
of the products.

As the NABL Testimony indicates: ``Derivatives are sophisticated securities products designed for sophisticated
investors and should not be sold to retail investors generally and certainly not without comprehensive disclosure.
If issuers choose to undertake the financial benefits of these sophisticated and complicated transactions, they
can assume the financial costs of providing *&blank;*&blank;* information.'' NABL Testimony at 22.

In particular, investors need to be informed about the nature and effects of each significant term of the debt, including
credit enhancements and risk modifiers, such as inverse floaters and detachable call rights. Investors in these
securities should be aware of their exposure to interest rate volatility, under all possible scenarios. In addition,
any legal risk concerning the issuer's authority to issue securities with unconventional features needs to be disclosed.
The PSA recently has identified disclosure that should be provided in connection with the offer of financial instruments
that include such features as auction and swap-based inverse floaters and embedded cap bonds.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit enhancements are used with increasing frequency in the municipal market. According to published information,
over 37% of the dollar volume of new long term issues carry some form of credit enhancement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The existence of bond insurance or other credit enhancement creates the need for disclosure concerning the provider
of the credit enhancement and the terms of the enhancement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to avoid misleading investors concerning the value of the enhancements provided and the party's ability to fund the
enhancement. The GFOA recommends that appropriate financial information about the assets, revenues, reserves
and results of operations of credit enhancers be provided in the official statement. In determining the extent of
disclosure, consideration should be given to the amount of the enhancement relative to the income and cash flows of
the issuer or obligor, conditions precedent to application of the enhancement, duration of the enhancement, and
other factors indicating a material relationship between the enhancement and the investor's anticipated return.

Although there continues to be some diversity in the financial reporting practices used in preparing financial statements
of governmental issuers, practice in the municipal market is evolving rapidly to reliance on generally accepted
accounting principles (``GAAP'') as determined by the Government Accounting Standards Board (``GASB'').

 Only two years after GASB was founded in 1984, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, as promulgated
by GASB, were required by 75.2% of cities, 78.3% of counties and 69% of school districts responding to a research survey.

 Forty-six states currently require, or are in the process of establishing a requirement, that state government financial
statements be presented in accordance with GAAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 In addition, local as well as state governments that receive significant amounts of federal aid must prepare financial
statements in accordance with GAAP or provide information concerning variance from GAAP.

 In the case of municipal issuers, these financial statement audits are typically conducted by either an independent

requires some periodic audit verification of government financial statements.

There are a number of areas in which greater care needs to be taken to provide investors with adequate information.
In a pooled financing structure, such as that used by bond banks, in addition to providing financial information concerning
the issuing authority or program in the aggregate, it may be necessary to provide information on participating obligors.
This will depend on diversification and risk concentration factors, such as the significance of any single obligor
to the overall financing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conduit bond issuers need to provide operational information concerning the activities of the private enterprise
that will provide the cash flows to service the debt_for example, financial reporting, legal proceedings, changes
in indebtedness, defaults and other significant developments relating to the underlying corporate obligor. Where
the issuing authority in a conduit financing has no remaining obligation for the repayment of the indebtedness, in
providing financial information about the issuing entity (as compared to the obligor on the bonds), care must be taken
to avoid misleading investors regarding the sources of repayment.

Municipal issuers also must consider disclosure issues arising from their activities as end users of derivative
products. For example, the use of non-exchange traded derivatives to alter interest rate risk exposes the issuer
to counterparty credit risk. Disclosure documents need to discuss the market risks to which issuers are exposed,
the strategies used to alter such risks and the exposure to both market risk and credit risk resulting from risk alteration
strategies. The NFMA has published sector specific secondary market disclosure guidelines calling for a discussion
of the issuer's use of derivative products, especially interest rate swaps.

Moreover, in addition to financial and operating data, the official statement may need to include a narrative explanation
to avoid misunderstanding and assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation. A numerical presentation
alone may not be sufficient to permit an investor to judge financial and operating condition of the issuer or obligor.

In addition, issuers must assess whether the future impact of currently known facts mandate disclosure. The GFOA
Guidelines call for a description of known facts that would significantly affect the financial information presented

Timeliness of Financial Statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The timeliness of financial information is a major factor in its usefulness. To avoid providing investors with a stale,
and therefore potentially misleading, picture of financial condition and results of operations, issuers and obligors
need to release their annual financial statements as soon as practical. After extensive discussion with market participants,
it appears that, for the most part, audited financial statements of municipal issuers for the most recently completed
fiscal year are available within six months after fiscal year end. The six month time period is consistent with the
recommendations of NASACT's Blue Ribbon Committee Report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An investor's ability to monitor future developments affecting the issuer, as well as the likely liquidity of a security,
are important to an investor's evaluation of an offering. The official statement should state clearly whether ongoing
disclosure concerning the issuer or obligor will be provided, including the type, timing, and method of providing
such information.

61
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

As discussed above, the Joint Statement recommends that the Commission adopt a rule prohibiting a municipal securities
dealer from underwriting securities absent a commitment to provide ongoing information. In the Companion Release,
the Commission is proposing such a rule for comment. In order to fully inform investors, an issuer needs to include
in the official statement a description of the scope of its continuing disclosure commitment, the type of information
that would be provided, the repositories to which the information would be sent, when annual and other periodic information
would be available, and the consequences of the issuer's failure to abide by the requirements of the covenant.

Like other disclosure documents, official statements need to be clear and concise to avoid misleading investors
through confusion and obfuscation. The expanded level of disclosure in official statements and increased sophistication
of municipal securities instruments have, in many cases, resulted in longer and more complex disclosure documents,
with the corresponding danger of overly detailed, legalistic, and possibly obtuse disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the concerns leading to the adoption of Rule 15c2&hyph;12 was that underwriters were not receiving official
statements within time periods that would allow them to examine the accuracy of the disclosure.

 The Commission noted in proposing the rule that a thorough, professional review by underwriters of municipal offering
documents could encourage appropriate disclosure of foreseeable risks and accurate descriptions of complex put
and call features, as well as novel financing structures now employed in many municipal offerings. In addition, with
the increase in novel or complex financings, there may be greater value in having investors receive disclosure documents
describing fundamental aspects of their investment. Yet, underwriters are unable to perform this function effectively
when offering statements are not provided to them on a timely basis.

To address this concern, the rule requires any underwriter, including lead underwriters, syndicate members, and
selling group members that receive in excess of the usual seller's commission, to obtain and review an official statement
that is deemed final as of its date by the issuer, except for the omission of certain information, before bidding for,
purchasing, offering, or selling municipal securities in a primary offering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the adoption of Rule 15c2&hyph;12, however, there have been continued problems with the timeliness of receipt
by underwriters of the ``near final'' official statement required by the Rule.

 In addition to compromising the ability of an underwriter to make a reasonable investigation of the issuer, this problem
also may limit the ability of potential customers to make informed investment decisions. In a recent NFMA survey,
59% of those responding rated the delivery of preliminary official statements in competitive sales as either not
very good or poor, and 50% rated the delivery of preliminary official statements in negotiated sales as either not
very good or poor.

One cause of delay has been confusion as to the point at which the underwriter must have obtained and reviewed the near
final official statement in a negotiated offering. The term ``offer'' traditionally has been defined broadly under
the federal securities laws and, for purposes of Rule 15c2&hyph;12, encompasses the distribution of a preliminary
official statement by the underwriter, as well as oral solicitations of indications of interest. Thus, prior to the
time that the underwriter distributes the preliminary official statement to potential investors, or otherwise
begins orally soliciting investors, the rule requires it to have obtained and reviewed a near final official statement.
If no offers are made, the underwriter is required to obtain and review a near final official statement by the earlier
of the time the underwriter agrees (whether in principle or by signing the bond purchase agreement) to purchase the
bonds, or the first sale of bonds to investors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission anticipated that, in order to allow underwriters to meet their obligation to have a reasonable basis
for recommending any municipal securities, issuers would have to begin drafting disclosure documents earlier,
and perhaps with greater care than in the past.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 Moreover, placing an obligation on the issuer to prepare the official statement at an earlier stage is appropriate,
because it is the issuer's obligation to ensure that there is timely dissemination of disclosure documents in connection
with the offer and sale of the issuer's securities.

To address disclosure issues involving conduit financings in a comprehensive fashion, however, legislation addressing
the exempt status of conduit securities under the federal securities laws is necessary. Bonds used to finance a project
to be used in the trade or business of a private corporation are, from an investment standpoint, equivalent to corporate
debt securities issued directly by the underlying corporate obligor.

 Payments on these types of conduit securities are derived solely from revenues received by the governmental entity
under the terms of a contractual agreement, typically a lease or a note, from a private enterprise, rather than from
the general credit and taxing power of the governmental issuer. The tax-exempt status of interest payments does not
alter the fundamental analysis that these are private obligations, in which the investor looks, and can look, only
to a private entity for repayment.

There were two bills introduced, one in 1975 and one in 1978, that would have repealed the exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The 1978 bill would have subjected certain industrial development bonds
to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the filing and qualification provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act and the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Neither bill was enacted.

While significant progress has been made in primary market disclosure practices in recent years, the same development
has not taken place with respect to secondary market disclosure. The GFOA issued separate secondary market disclosure
guidelines in 1979, but they have not yet achieved the broad acceptance accorded its primary offering guidance. In
the last five years, the NFMA, the National Council of State Housing Agencies, and the Association of Local Housing
Authorities have published sector specific guidelines for secondary market disclosure; the National Advisory
Council of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers (``NASACT'') is in the process
of preparing such guidelines for adoption by the states.

annual financial reports meeting its guidelines. The NFMA's Award of Recognition Program likewise recognizes issuers
that have committed to provide continuous disclosure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in the municipal securities market do not dispute the need for ongoing disclosure following an offering
of securities, but municipal issuers reportedly resist developing a routine of ongoing disclosure to the investing
market because of concerns about the costs of generating and disseminating that information and about potential
liability relating to such disclosure. These issuers and obligors are at times advised by their professional advisors
that there is no duty under the federal securities laws to make disclosure following the completion of the distribution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At least some municipal issuers thus appear to believe that silence shields them from liability for what may later
be found to be false or misleading information. As a practical matter, however, municipal issuers do not have the option
of remaining silent. Given the wide range of information routinely released to the public, formally and informally,
by these issuers in their day-to-day operations, the stream of information on which the market relies does not cease
with the close of a municipal offering. In light of the public nature of these issuers and their accountability and
governmental functions, a variety of information about issuers of municipal securities is collected by state and
local governmental bodies, and routinely made publicly available.

A municipal issuer may not be subject to the mandated continuous reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, but when
it releases information to the public that is reasonably expected to reach investors and the trading markets, those
disclosures are subject to the antifraud provisions.

 Those statements are a principal source of significant, current information about the issuer of the security, and
thus reasonably can be expected to reach investors and the trading market. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit has said: ``The securities markets are highly sensitive to press releases and to information contained in
all sorts of publicly released . . . documents, and the investor is foolish who would ignore such releases.''

 Since investors obtain information concerning the fiscal health of a municipal issuer from its public statements
concerning financial and other matters, ``[t]he nature of these statements and the assumptions upon which they are
based must be carefully and accurately communicated to the public, so that potential investors may be fully informed
of all material facts relevant to their investment decision.''

Municipal issuers should also be sensitive to whether their official statements contain forward-looking statements,
such as projections of revenues, that remain alive in the market and may require updating in light of subsequent events.
Guides for Disclosure of Projections of Future Economic Performance, Exchange Act Rel. No. 5992 (Nov. 7, 1978), 43

The current process by which municipal issuers and their officials release information to market participants does
not address the risk of misleading investors, because there is no mechanism for disseminating information about
the municipal issuer to the market as a whole. To the contrary, in the municipal market, information released publicly
frequently is disseminated only to a narrow segment of the marketplace. For example, market participants who request
current information from indenture trustees are often turned away on the grounds that they are not current holders
of the securities.

Under notice provisions of indentures, the issuer and trustee generally are required to provide notice to existing
bondholders of events of default and other significant matters, such as a draw on reserves, a failure to renew a letter
of credit, or a substitution of collateral. ABA 1991 Guidelines at 10. Indeed, trustees often deny requests by market
participants for information out of concern for liability arising from exceeding the authority set forth in the indenture.
Fippinger at 325. This situation led the American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee, in cooperation
with the National Association of Bond Lawyers, to develop agreed upon guidelines for indenture provisions permitting
the trustee to provide public notice of specified events. See ABA 1991 Guidelines.

Since access by market participants to current and reliable information is uneven and inefficient, municipal issuers
presently face a risk of misleading investors through public statements that may not be intended to be the basis of
investment decisions, but nevertheless may reasonably be expected to reach the securities markets. As market participants
have urged,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
92
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to minimize the risk of misleading investors, municipal issuers should establish practices and procedures
to identify and timely disclose, in a manner designed to inform the trading market, material information reflecting
on the creditworthiness of the issuer and obligor and the terms of the security.

For frequent issuers, current information can be disseminated in official statements for new offerings, and thus
is readily available without the preparation of a separate annual financial report. Regardless of the form of document
relied upon to provide the marketplace with information concerning the financial condition of the issuer or obligor,
to minimize risk of misleading investors, issuers or obligors should provide, as discussed above with respect to
primary offerings:

As discussed above with respect to offering statements, as a general matter, the annual financial information may
reasonably be expected to be made available within six months of the issuer's fiscal year end.

 For some conduit entities, annual information may not be sufficient and investors may need more frequent periodic
financial information. Under guidelines developed by the National Council of State Housing Agencies, for example,
current information on loan portfolio status is compiled and disseminated to information repositories on a quarterly
basis.

 Similar ongoing disclosure on a periodic basis appears appropriate for analogous conduit municipal financings
such as structured student loan programs, housing and health care financings.

In addition to periodic information, to assure that participants in the secondary market base their investment decisions
on current information, commentators have called for timely disclosure of events that materially reflect on the
creditworthiness of municipal securities issuers and obligors and the terms of their securities. There is a general
consensus among participants in the municipal securities market that investors need information about the following
events, among others, where material:

Proposed Disclosure Guidelines for Corporate Trustees

 (ABA Draft for Discussion Purposes) (June 12, 1990) (``ABA 1990 Guidelines''). As published in final form in September
of 1991 (``ABA 1991 Guidelines''), the Guidelines contained a nonexclusive list of five types of events that could
be disclosed by notice to a repository. Numerous market participants have referenced the ABA draft proposal, or variations
of that proposal, as a starting point for identifying straightforward, nonjudgmental, categories of events that
call for prompt disclosure. An addendum to the Joint Statement provided four examples of ``significant information''
that the participants considered appropriate for disclosure. The nonexclusive examples were (1) nontechnical
defaults, (2) draws from a debt service reserve fund, (3) failure to make a regularly scheduled payment, and (4) any
draws on any credit enhancement. Joint Statement, Addendum. The list set forth above is drawn from these proposals.

3. Dissemination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the municipal market today lacks an effective mechanism for dissemination of material information
to investors and the marketplace. To be effective in minimizing the issuer's risk under the antifraud provisions,
the annual financial information and event disclosure should be disseminated in a manner reasonably designed to
inform the holders of the issuer's securities and the market for those securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trustees can serve as cost effective disseminators of information to the market due to the capacity and duties of trustees
under the terms of the indentures, which positions them to have knowledge of the events requiring disclosure, and
the ability and authority to communicate with bondholders.
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission encourages the inclusion of provisions in trust indentures that authorize trustees to transmit information
to the market, particularly in structured financings where the issuer's obligations generally are delegated to
various participants. Trustees also may provide a service to other small issuers, by enabling them to notify the market
in a timely manner and at a lower cost.

The common denominator for current proposals to improve secondary market disclosure for municipal securities is
the establishment and designation of one or more information repositories to serve as a collection and access point
for annual and current information.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 Such repositories would serve as predetermined sources for information concerning a particular issuer, allowing
participants to verify that they have the latest available information concerning the issuer before recommending,
purchasing, or bidding for a security. The repositories would supplement, not substitute for, the existing access
bondholders may have to issuers to obtain current information.

The American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee and the National Association of Bond Lawyers, as well
as the Joint Statement, have expressed concern that securities depositories and their participants do not retransmit
notices they receive from trustees and issuers to the beneficial owners of the issuer's securities. The ABA Corporate
Trust Committee sought to address the problem by calling for simultaneous dissemination of the information to the
marketplace through an information repository. The National Association of Bond Lawyers has suggested that the
Commission promulgate a rule mandating that all depositories and their direct and indirect participants promptly
retransmit notices received from the issuer or indenture trustee. While the establishment of information repositories
may address the problem to some extent, the Commission staff intends to work with the relevant organizations to assure
that steps are taken to provide for consistent retransmission of the information.

In the Companion Release, the Commission is proposing an amendment to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to prohibit, as suggested
by the Joint Statement, underwriting of a municipal securities issue unless the issuer of the municipal security
has covenanted to provide annual and ongoing disclosure to a repository.

V. Interpretive Guidance With Respect to Obligations of Municipal Securities Dealers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Proposing and Adopting Releases for Rule 15c2&hyph;12, the Commission set forth its interpretation of the
obligation of municipal underwriters under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The interpretation
discussed the duty of underwriters to the investing public to have a reasonable basis for recommending any municipal
securities, and their responsibility, in fulfilling that obligation, to review in a professional manner the accuracy
of statements made in connection with the offering. The interpretation was set out in the Proposing Release, and modified
slightly in the Adopting Release. The Commission reaffirms its Interpretation with respect to underwriters' responsibilities
under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the underwriter's obligation, as discussed in the prior releases, to review the official statement and
to have a reasonable basis for its belief in the accuracy and completeness of the official statement's key representations,
disclaimers by underwriters of responsibility for the information provided by the issuer or other parties, without
further clarification regarding the underwriter's belief as to accuracy, and the basis therefor, are misleading
and should not be included in official statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the Commission believes that it is also appropriate to emphasize the responsibilities of brokers and
dealers in trading municipal securities in the secondary market. The Commission historically has taken the position
that a broker-dealer recommending securities to investors implies by its recommendation that it has an adequate
basis for the recommendation.
<FOOTCITE>104</FOOTCITE>
 A dealer, unlike an underwriter, ordinarily is not obligated to contact the issuer to verify information. A dealer
must, however, have a reasonable basis for its recommendation.
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 If, based on publicly available information, a dealer discovers any factors that indicate the disclosure is inaccurate
or incomplete, or signal the need for further inquiry, a municipal securities dealer may need to obtain additional
information, or seek to verify existing information.

One of the rules proposed simultaneously with the issuance of this release would require a broker, dealer or municipal
securities dealer to review current information provided by the issuer prior to recommending a transaction in a municipal
security. In the absence of such current information, the dealer could not recommend a transaction in the issuer's
securities. That rule, which would be applicable to municipal securities issued subsequent to the effective date
of the proposed rule, would reinforce the obligations of dealers under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws to have a reasonable basis for recommendations of outstanding municipal securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Joint Statement also called for a strengthening of the suitability rules to require disclosure of ratings and
whether the issuer has committed to provide annual financial reports. Today, the Commission is proposing amendments
to its confirmation rules to require disclosure of the absence of a rating in confirmations. The MSRB has indicated
it has under consideration a plan requiring municipal securities dealers to disclose to their customers the importance
of secondary market information and whether the issuer has agreed to voluntarily provide such disclosures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the citrus canker regulations by removing the areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties, FL,
from the list of quarantined areas and by removing the area in Hillsborough County, FL, from the list of survey areas.
No evidence of citrus canker has been found in these areas for at least 2 years. This action appears necessary to relieve
regulatory restrictions which are no longer necessary.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Citrus canker is a plant disease caused by strains of the bacterium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Xanthomonas campestris 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citri
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The disease is known to affect plants and plant parts, including fresh fruit, of citrus and citrus relatives (Family
Rutaceae). It can cause defoliation and other serious damage to the leaves and twigs of susceptible plants. It may
also make the fruit of infected plants unmarketable by causing lesions on the fruit. Infected fruit may also drop from
trees before reaching maturity. The Asiatic strains of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A strains) are aggressive strains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the United States, Florida is the only State where citrus canker has been present in recent years. Regulations to
prevent the interstate spread of citrus canker from Florida are contained in 7 CFR 301.75&hyph;1 through 301.75&hyph;14,
``Subpart_Citrus Canker'' (referred to below as ``the regulations''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations designate certain areas in Florida as quarantined areas and impose restrictions on the interstate
movement of regulated articles from and through quarantined areas. The regulations also designate survey areas,
which surround the quarantined areas. Survey areas undergo close monitoring by Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) and State inspectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations currently designate certain areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties as quarantined for citrus canker.
An area in Hillsborough County is also currently designated in the regulations as a survey area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quarantined area in Highlands County was established in response to the detection of citrus canker caused by the
A strains in a commercial grove in October 1990. The area in Manatee County has been quarantined since June 1986 because
of the detection of citrus canker caused by the A strains. All the quarantined areas and all the survey areas have been
surveyed for citrus canker on a regular basis since the initial detections. No evidence of citrus canker has been observed
in the Highlands County quarantined area since June 19, 1991. No citrus canker has been found in the Manatee County
quarantined area since January 19, 1992, and no evidence of citrus canker has been observed in the Hillsborough County
survey area at any time. APHIS believes, therefore, that it is safe to conclude that citrus canker is not present in
any of these areas, and that it is no longer necessary to require any special requirements to be met within these areas
or to limit the interstate movement from or through these areas of regulated articles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these facts, we are proposing to remove the areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties from the list of quarantined
areas (&sect;301.75&hyph;4(a)) and to remove the area in Hillsborough County from the list of survey areas (&sect;301.75&hyph;4(d)(1)).
The removal of these areas will remove all quarantined areas and survey areas for citrus canker in the United States.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this proposed rule is adopted, all areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties would be released from their classification
as quarantined areas, and the area in Hillsborough County would be released from its classification as a survey area.
If the proposed rule is adopted, citrus plants, plant parts, citrus fruit, and other regulated articles from currently
quarantined areas would be allowed to be moved interstate to other areas in the United States, including commercial
citrus-producing areas, and regulated articles would be allowed to be moved interstate through quarantined areas.
Requirements which apply to survey areas would also be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined that 237 individuals and businesses would be economically affected by the proposed changes. These
individuals and businesses include: Lawn care companies (82), grove owners (74 persons who own 2,177 acres), retail
nursery outlets (21), fruit processors (15), fruit harvesting contractors (12), fruit shippers (12), fresh fruit
packing houses (11), nurseries (9), and seed extractors (1). APHIS believes that virtually all of these individuals
and businesses are small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These individuals and businesses are all currently required to comply with the regulations. This results in inconvenience
and in some cases expenses that are not encountered by similar individuals and businesses in other parts of the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the costs of compliance are, in many cases, minimal, and that the individuals and businesses
affected by the regulations represent less than one percent of all similar individuals and businesses in Florida.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the largest groups of affected individuals and business is grove owners. We estimate that this rule change would
save each affected grove owner approximately $25 per acre, per year, by removing requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and personnel leaving their groves. These costs represent a small
percentage of the owners' overall production costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this proposed rule would allow grove owners to expand the areas into which their fruit could be moved interstate,
in that they would be allowed to move fruit interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas. We anticipate that any
impact from this rule change would be negligible, as approximately 90 percent of all of Florida's citrus production
is for the juice market, and only about 10 percent is for the fresh fruit market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to grove owners in the quarantined areas, truckers, packing and processing plants, and lawn services
within the currently quarantined areas would no longer be subject to inspection and would no longer need to carry out
activities now required by the regulations. This would result in financial savings to these entities. This also means
that groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement, regulated trees, and regulated plants in the current
survey area would no longer be subject to regular inspections for citrus canker. This change would reduce the burden
on APHIS and State agencies, which currently provide inspectors to perform regular inspections in the survey area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 955 (7 CFR part 955) regulating the handling of
Vidalia onions grown in Georgia. The marketing agreement and order are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposal is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This proposal will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this proposal on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 145 handlers of Vidalia onions that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and
approximately 250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business

Section 955.42(f), of the marketing order provides authority for the Committee to impose a late payment or an interest
charge or both, on any handlers who fail to pay assessments in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 18, 1993, the Committee met to discuss, among other things, the difficulty it has experienced in collecting
assessments from some handlers. It reported that during the past season approximately 20 handlers paid assessments
late. When this occurred, handlers who paid their assessments on time were placed in an unfair situation compared
to those handlers who failed to do so. The delinquent handlers were able to use the money which was due the Committee
for other financial obligations and thus eliminate interest charges on money that they might otherwise have had to
borrow to pay those other financial obligations. This money could also have been invested to earn interest for the
delinquent handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the meeting, the Committee determined that it was important to encourage all handlers to pay their assessments
promptly, thereby eliminating these inequities and avoiding additional and unnecessary collection costs. The
Committee recommended the following proposal. If a handler does not pay all of the handler's assessments 30 days after
the date of billing, the unpaid portion of the account would be considered delinquent and subject to interest charges
at the rate of one percent per month. Handlers would be charged interest charges on unpaid assessments and interest
charges on any unpaid interest charges until the late obligation is paid in full. The Committee assesses handlers
on a monthly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee believes that the proposed interest charge is high enough to discourage handlers from delaying assessment
payments. Thus, this proposal is expected to encourage all handlers to pay their assessments in a timely manner, and
facilitate the collection of funds to pay expenses necessary for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of fifteen days is provided for all interested persons to submit written comments. The Committee would like
the proposal to be effective as soon as possible so that efforts to encourage timely payments can be implemented early
in 1994. All comments timely received will be considered before issuing a final decision on this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (``NRC'' or ``Commission'') received a petition for rulemaking submitted by
the American College of Nuclear Physicians (``ACNP'') and the Society of Nuclear Medicine (``SNM'') (``petitioners'').
The petitioners requested that the Commission amend its regulations governing the user and annual fees charged to
their members due to increases in those fees. Among the specific requests contained in the petition were to establish
a generic exemption for medical licensees who provide services in nonprofit institutions and to allow NRC licensees
a greater voice in the development of new regulations by the NRC. After careful consideration, the Commission has
decided not to adopt the proposals made in the petition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 18, 1992, the NRC received a petition for rulemaking submitted by petitioners ACNP and SNM. The petitioners
requested that the NRC amend 10 CFR parts 170 and 171 which govern the annual and user fees imposed on most NRC materials
licensees by the Commission since the advent of 100 percent fee recovery in FY 1991. The petitioners requested these
amendments because of the substantial adverse impacts experienced by their members following increases in the NRC's
user and annual fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 12, 1992 (57 FR 20211), the NRC published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing receipt of the petition. In that notice, the NRC stated that it would consider the issues raised by petitioners
within the context of the review and evaluation of the fee program for FY 1993 conducted as part of the NRC's continued
implementation of Public Law 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended (OBRA&hyph;90).
On October 13, 1992 (57 FR 46818), the NRC published a notice requesting public comment on the issues raised in the petition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC received nearly 100 comments in response to this request, with the vast majority in favor of granting the petition.
After careful consideration of the comments, the Commission has decided to deny the petition for rulemaking, for
reasons stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of commenters simply restated their support for some or all of the requested changes in NRC policy detailed
in the petition. In their petition, ACNP and SNM stated that NRC fee increases under the 100 percent recovery regime
were adversely affecting their members' practice of nuclear medicine, in the process harming the societal benefits
which stem from that field of medicine. The petitioners claimed that they could not recoup the costs of NRC fees because
Medicare reimbursement levels are inadequate and because competing nuclear medicine alternatives are not regulated
(or charged fees) by the NRC. Petitioners then compared their treatment under the NRC's fee rules to that of nonprofit
educational institutions, power reactors and small entities, all of whom petitioners claimed receive special treatment
by the NRC, and argued that for exemption purposes medical licensees should not be lumped together with all other materials
licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, ACNP and SNM requested that the Commission take the following policy actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Grant a generic exemption for medical services provided in nonprofit institutions, such as hospitals, similar
to that granted to nonprofit educational institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide individualized exemption criteria for medical licensees, by means of a ``simple template for structuring
exemption requests;'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Adopt a sliding scale of minimum fees that grants nuclear physicians more relief than the current small entity
classification (which grants relief to physicians in private practice with less than $1,000,000 in gross receipts);
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Give NRC licensees a greater voice in the NRC's decisionmaking process for developing new regulatory programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In that regard, petitioners suggested that the criteria contained in the NRC's backfit rule be applied to the development
of all new regulatory programs. That is, if a regulation is not necessary for the adequate protection of the public
health and safety, the NRC would be required to show that the rule would substantially increase safety and that its
benefits outweigh its costs.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission does not believe that the analogy between colleges and universities and medical services provided
in a nonprofit institution is a valid one. The Commission recently decided to reinstate a longstanding (but temporarily
withdrawn) fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions. The key to educational institutions' singular
treatment, however, is not their nonprofit status, nor the fact that they provide valuable social benefits; rather,
it is the existence of certain structural market failures in educational institutions' production of new knowledge.
In other words, colleges and universities produce new knowledge primarily through basic research, and disseminate
it (essentially for free) to all who want it, without receiving compensation from those benefitting. In economic
terms, this new knowledge is often termed a ``public good.''

The Commission's analysis of this aspect of the petition is based in part on a memorandum prepared by an NRC consultant
on the topic of externalized benefits and public goods. This memorandum has been placed in the NRC Public Document
Room for examination by any interested persons. See Memorandum to NRC Staff from Stephen J.K. Walters, Professor
of Economics, Loyola College (Md.), dated January 4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two defining characteristics of a public good are its nondepletability and nonexcludability. That is, one person's
acquisition of knowledge does not reduce the amount available to others; further, it is not efficient_and often is
impossible, as a practical matter_to prevent others from acquiring it at a zero price. These characteristics make
it difficult to recoup the costs of producing new knowledge. Because the value of a public good may be very great, but
the costs of producing it impossible to recapture, public subsidies may be necessary for production to occur at all.
The Commission has decided to exempt nonprofit educational institutions from annual fees to advance continued production
of new knowledge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By contrast, medical practitioners have the capability of obtaining compensation for the benefits they provide.
Unlike new knowledge, medical services are both depletable and excludable. The benefits of medicine, while unquestionably
significant, are therefore a private rather than a public good, in economic terms. The Commission believes, in sum,
that the market failure considerations that apply to educational institutions' attempts to produce new knowledge
simply do not apply to medical practitioners. There is no structural barrier to the recovery of costs incurred in producing
the benefits of medicine. The situation of the medical practitioners is not fundamentally different from that of
the for-profit licensees whose claims for exemption on grounds of inability to pass through costs the Commission
has rejected in the past. (See 58 FR 38666&hyph;68; July 20, 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, the Commission notes petitioners' claim that Medicare may not account for NRC fees when reimbursing
physicians and hospitals. The Commission is also aware of pricing pressures caused by competing nuclear medicine
modalities not regulated (or charged fees) by the NRC. However, as the Commission explained in its FY 1993 fee rule,
it is impracticable for this agency to evaluate the merits of such empirical claims regarding the ability of licensees
to pass through fee costs to their customers. (See 58 FR 38666, 38667&hyph;68; July 20, 1993.) The Commission ``does
not believe it has the expertise or information needed to undertake the subtle and complex inquiry whether in a market
economy particular licensees can or cannot easily recapture the costs of annual fees from their customers.'' (58
FR 38667; July 20, 1993.) This statement applies equally to medical licensees as it does to all others whose products
cannot be characterized as a ``public good.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing the petition's second major point, the Commission disagrees with those commenters who call for new individualized
exemption criteria for medical licensees. The Commission believes that the current exemption process for materials
licensees, as codified in 10 CFR 171.11(d), provides medical licensees with the opportunity to request an exemption
by means of detailing their particularized circumstances.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both exemption procedures (power reactor and materials licensee) contained in &sect;171.11 allow the requester
to inform the Commission of ``[a]ny *&blank;*&blank;* relevant matter that the licensee believes'' should impact
on the exemption decision. This allows the Commission flexibility to consider each situation on its own merits. Were
the Commission to attempt to establish specific criteria for each type of materials licensee, itself a daunting task,
it might then be prevented from considering factors which did not fall precisely within those enumerated. And if the
Commission retained the open-ended provision quoted above, it would have expended considerable time and resources
to little purpose, as licensees could make the same claims under new criteria that they can at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners also complained that the NRC had established a high threshold for granting materials exemption requests.
In this regard, the Commission explained in the first 100 percent fee recovery rule, in FY 1991, that because it was
statutorily required to collect 100 percent, it could not easily exempt licensees from fees. If one licensee or class
of licensees is exempted, those fees must then be placed on other licensees, increasing their fee burden. It is for
that reason that the Commission only grants exemptions in exceptional circumstances. (See 56 FR 31472, 31485; July
10, 1991.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners' third request, that the Commission establish a sliding scale of minimum fees based on the size of the
licensee, which ``reflects the unique constraints on physicians'', also is denied. In its FY 1991 fee rule, the Commission
explained in great detail why it devised its fee schedules in the manner it did, basing fees on classes of licensees
rather than licensee-by-licensee. (See FY 1991 Final Rule, 56 FR 31472, and Appendix A to the Final Rule; July 10, 1991.)
There is no information contained in either the petition or comments on the petition which would lead the Commission
to reconsider this approach, and therefore the Commission must deny this aspect of the petition as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Commission intends to re-examine the size standards it uses to define small entities within the context
of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Commission will conduct this review within the context of
revision of the small business size standards proposed by the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') (58 FR 46573;
September 2, 1993). The Commission will not complete this review until the SBA promulgates its final rule on this matter.
These activities may result in a revised definition of ``small entity'' more favorable to petitioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission denies petitioners' request that licensees be provided more power over the development
of NRC regulations, and that a new backfit rule incorporating cost-benefit analysis be instituted to evaluate the
agency's regulatory programs. The Commission denied similar requests in its FY 1991 fee rule, explaining that the
NRC is not exempt ``from the normal Government review and budgetmaking process.'' The Commission at that time pointed
out that ``the Government is not subject to audit by outside parties,'' and that ``[a]udits are performed by the General
Accounting Office or the agency's Inspector General, as appropriate.'' (56 FR 31472, 31482; July 10, 1991.) Additionally,
the NRC complies with Federal regulations such as the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that require agency analysis of the economic effects of new regulations on licensees. The NRC Staff also prepares
detailed cost-benefit analyses to justify any new regulatory requirements; these analyses are carefully reviewed
by the Commission. The Commission has seen nothing either in the petition or comments on the petition that would lead
it to change its approach in this area. The Commission would like to emphasize, however, that licensees are always
welcome and expected to comment on proposed rulemakings, including the accompanying cost-benefit analyses, and
that such comments, along with petitions such as the present one, workshops, meetings of the Advisory Committee on
the Medical Use of Isotopes, and the day-to-day interaction between licensees and the agency, in the Commission's
view provide an adequate and successful method of keeping each group apprised of the other's concerns.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission received a potpourri of comments on other aspects of the petition. A number of commenters disagreed
with the petition, arguing that medical licensees should not receive an exemption, as the costs of such an exemption
would be borne by other licensees to whom the additional fees would have no relation, and that every licensee should
pay its fair share. Other commenters stated that the fees should be abolished entirely, which would remove the dilemma
over granting exemptions. One commenter argued for basing an exemption on the function for which the license is utilized,
not the function of the licensed organization. Some commenters argued that fees should be based on factors such as
the amount of radioactive sources possessed, the number of procedures performed or the size of the nuclear department
within a hospital. Certain commenters suggested expanding the number of exemptions to include Government agencies,
along with those licensees which provide products and services to medical and educational entities. One commenter
requested that the NRC take Agreement State schedules into account when setting its own fee schedule. Another commenter
raised concerns as to the expense of NRC contractors and the quality of NRC regulation. And a few commenters urged the
NRC to reevaluate or abolish its then-recently instituted Quality Management (QM) Program.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the Commission stated above, it is denying this petition for rulemaking, and therefore not exempting medical licensees
for services provided in a nonprofit institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission cannot abolish its fees unilaterally, as the requirement to collect 100 percent of the agency's annual
budget authority through user and annual fees is statutorily mandated by Congress, see section 6101 of OBRA&hyph;90.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has explained in the past why it did not believe that basing fees on factors such as number of sources
or the size of the facility would result in a fairer allocation of the 100 percent recovery requirement. (See FY 1991
Final Rule, 56 FR 31472; July 10, 1991, and Appendix A to that Final Rule; and Limited Revision of Fee Schedules, 57 FR
13625; April 17, 1992.) The Commission has seen no evidence in the petition or comments on the petition which would
lead it to change its current approach of charging fees by class of licensee. For reasons similar to those stated in
the earlier rules cited above, the Commission does not believe it would be feasible to base an exemption on the function
for which a license is utilized rather than on the function of the licensed organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has also explained in prior rulemakings why it has decided to charge Federal agencies annual fees,
and has seen nothing in comments on the petition which would cause it to change its position on this policy matter. (See
FY 1991 Final Rule, 56 FR 31472, 31474&hyph;45; July 10, 1991.) The Commission also does not believe that the exemption
for nonprofit educational institutions should be expanded to cover those private companies supplying services
and products to medical or educational licensees. The fact that the cost of these services and products impacts upon
exempt licensees is not sufficient reason to exempt private for-profit licensees. By exempting nonprofit educational
institutions from fees, the Commission has addressed the direct impact of its fees on those institutions. Additionally,
the Commission has discussed in both prior and current rulemakings the necessity of a high threshold for exemption
requests and the overarching requirement to collect as close to 100 percent of its annual budget authority as possible;
these factors remain valid here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Commission acknowledges that in many cases Agreement States base their fee schedules in some measure on
the NRC's fee schedule, the NRC cannot do the reverse. The NRC must conform its fees to the 100 percent recovery requirements
mandated by OBRA&hyph;90, independent of Agreement State fee schedules over which the agency has no control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission believes that comments on the agency's QM program, NRC contracting practices and the overall
quality of NRC regulation are beyond the scope of this notice. However, the Commission notes that the agency's regulation
codifying its QM program was challenged and ultimately upheld in court. See

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, that currently requires inspections to verify the installation of shear
pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of the center pylon thrust link, and
repair, if necessary. That AD also provides an optional terminating action, which, if accomplished, would terminate
the repetitive inspections. That AD was prompted by a report that both shear pins that attach the aft end of the center
engine pylon thrust link to the tail pylon were missing. This action would add inspections to verify that the shear
pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specified limits; and a terminating modification for those inspections.
This action would also remove the optional terminating action, and expand the applicability of the rule to include
additional airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the engine
mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 14, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8403 (57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992),
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, to require repetitive visual inspections
to verify the installation of shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts at the aft end
of the center engine (No. 2) pylon thrust link; repair of any discrepancy found; and submission of a report of inspection
findings to the FAA. That AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. That AD
was prompted by a report that both shear pins that attach the aft end of the center engine pylon thrust link to the tail
pylon were missing. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the engine mount structure,
which could lead to loss of airplane components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, one operator has reported that, during the initial visual inspection
conducted in accordance with that AD, all bolts and nuts were found installed; however, during a subsequent repetitive
inspection, one nut and one bolt that attach the retainer were missing. If the retainers are missing, the shear pins
may also be missing and the engine thrust loads will be improperly distributed to the airplane structure. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane
components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1,
dated June 3, 1993. This service bulletin revision adds procedures for performing repetitive inspections to verify
that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specific limits. This service bulletin revision
also describes procedures for replacement of the existing retainer and attaching parts with a new retainer and attaching
parts. Incorporation of this replacement eliminates the need for repetitive visual inspections and repetitive
tightness verifications. The effectivity listing of this service bulletin revision includes 34 additional airplanes
identified as being subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03 to continue to require repetitive visual inspections
to verify the installation of the shear pins, the shear pin retainers, and the shear pin retainer attaching parts in
the aft end of the center engine (No. 2) pylon thrust link. The proposed AD would add repetitive inspections to verify
that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specified limits. If any shear pin, shear pin retainer,
or shear pin retainer attaching part is missing during any inspection, this proposal would continue to require repair
in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. The ``optional terminating action'' provided by AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03,
which consists of a one-time verification for tightness of the nuts of the four shear pin retainer attaching bolts,
would no longer be provided in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed AD would also require eventual replacement of the existing retainer and attaching parts with a new retainer
and attaching parts. When accomplished, this replacement would be considered terminating action for the currently
required repetitive visual inspections and the proposed repetitive verifications of tightness. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the revised alert service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would also require that operators submit a report to the FAA of any discrepancy found during any inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this proposal would expand the applicability of the rule to include additional airplanes that have
been identified as being subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 94 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be provided at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $36,960, or $880 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords, stiffeners,
and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary; and replacement
of any loose fastener. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks and loose fasteners found in the forward
lower spar web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and
JT9D&hyph;7 series engines. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the strut
from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has received six reports of fatigue cracks and one report of loose fasteners found in the forward lower spar
web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and JT9D&hyph;7
series engines. The cracks were found in the area under the stiffeners and baffle and along the web chord. The airplanes
on which these cracks were found had accumulated between 6,451 and 18,350 flight cycles and between 17,797 and 83,960
flight hours. All cracks reported have been found on the web of the inboard strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During investigation of a recent in-flight engine loss, a similar crack of approximately two inches in length was
found on the forward lower spar web. Although the in-inflight engine loss incident is still under investigation,
the crack in the web was determined to be a contributing cause of the accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cracking in the forward lower spar web of the inboard strut could reduce the lateral strength of the strut. This condition,
if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane
due to fatigue cracking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although all cracks reported were found on the web of the inboard strut, given standard design tolerances, little
difference exists between the thickness of the web of the inboard strut (0.025 inch) and that of the outboard strut
(0.032 inch). Additionally, the inboard and outboard webs are similar in configuration and loading environments.
For these reasons, the FAA finds that the outboard strut web is subject to the same unsafe condition as the inboard strut
web.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2160, dated September 9, 1993, that
describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections of the inboard strut chords, stiffeners, and web
to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary; and replacement of any
loose fastener found. These same procedures are effective for inspecting the outboard strut chord. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords,
stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary;
and replacement of any loose fastener. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the procedures
specified in the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification
program for the engine strut that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification
program is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 380 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 140 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 22 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $169,400, or $1,210 per
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The DEA proposes to eliminate the threshold for ephedrine under provisions of the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking
Act of 1988 (CDTA) in order to reduce the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratory operators. This would subject
all transactions involving bulk ephedrine and single entity ephedrine drug products to the applicable provisions
of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Ephedrine is the primary precursor utilized in the clandestine synthesis of methamphetamine and methcathinone,
both potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulants controlled under the CSA. The public health risks from the abuse
of these drugs are well known and documented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ephedrine is a listed chemical under the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690).
Under provisions of the CDTA (21 U.S.C. 802(34)(c)), thresholds were originally assigned to each listed chemical.
The CDTA imposes reporting and recordkeeping requirements for regulated transactions which meet or exceed these
threshold amounts of a listed chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act (DCDCA) of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;200) was recently enacted and will
become effective on April 16, 1994. This Act amends the CSA to permit that no threshold be established for a listed chemical
via modification of 21 U.S.C. 802(39)(A) by redefining the term ``regulated transaction'' as a ``distribution,
receipt, sale, importation, or exportation, or an international transaction involving shipment of a listed chemical,
or if the Attorney General establishes a threshold amount for a specific listed chemical, a threshold amount, including
a cumulative threshold amount for multiple transactions'' of a listed chemical. By not establishing a threshold
for a listed chemical, all regulated transactions regardless of size are subject to CDTA reporting and recordkeeping
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the DCDCA further modifies the definition of a ``regulated transaction'' by removing the exemption
of those transactions involving products which are marketed or distributed lawfully in the U.S. under the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), if these products contain ephedrine or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers as the only active
medicinal ingredient or contain ephedrine in combination with therapeutically insignificant quantities of another
active medicinal ingredient (21 U.S.C. 802(39)(A)(iv)). The DCDCA also provides that the Attorney General shall
by regulation remove this exemption for drug products that the Attorney General finds are being diverted in order
to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled substance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The threshold for ephedrine was originally established as 1.0 kilogram for domestic and import/export transactions,
after internal study and industry consultation (54 FR 31657). The threshold of 1.0 kilogram of ephedrine base is equivalent
to greater than 48,000 ephedrine 25 mg tablets or capsules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thresholds are continuously reviewed by DEA to determine if they are satisfactory to prevent diversion without overburdening
industry. Current evidence indicates that the threshold for ephedrine of 1.0 kilogram is not adequate to prevent
the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratory operators. Clandestine laboratory operators are obtaining
and utilizing ephedrine in quantities much less than the current 1.0 kilogram threshold in the illicit production
of methamphetamine and methcathinone. The DEA has determined that in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of
the CDTA in curtailing the diversion of ephedrine, there should be no threshold for ephedrine. Subsequently, all
regulated transactions of ephedrine are subject to reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the CDTA regardless
of size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While seizures of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories have decreased significantly since the passage of
the CDTA, more than 1200 methamphetaime laboratories have been seized in the United States since 1990. The majority
of these laboratories utilized ephedrine as the precursor. In 1992, greater than 68 percent of the methamphetamine
laboratories seized utilized ephedrine. A preliminary review of 1993 methamphetamine laboratory seizure data
indicates that ephedrine was the precursor utilized in approximately 75 percent of these laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to its use as the preferred precursor for the production of methamphetamine, ephedrine is also utilized
in the synthesis of methcathinone. The clandestine manufacture of methcathinone, a methamphetamine analogue known
on the street as ``Cat'', has been identified in the U.S. since 1991, when five laboratories were seized. Methcathinone
was temporarily placed in Schedule I on May 1, 1992, pursuant to the emergency scheduling provisions of the CSA (21
U.S.C. 811(h)). Effective October 15, 1993, methcathinone was permanently controlled in Schedule I (58 FR 53404).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methcathinone (N-methylcathinone) is manufactured in clandestine laboratories via the oxidation of ephedrine.
Since June of 1991, all clandestine methcathinone laboratories seized utilized ephedrine as the precursor. These
laboratories were located in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Washington and Wisconsin. The number of methcathinone
laboratory seizures continues to grow from six in 1992 to 21 laboratories in 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methcathinone is usually produced in small batches. Seizures of illicit methcathinone laboratories indicate that
batch sizes routinely utilize less than 20 grams of ephedrine. The vast majority of this ephedrine is obtained via
the purchase of over-the-counter (OTC) ephedrine 25 mg tablets sold in bottles of 1000 dosage units or less.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Batch sizes of methamphetamine produced at clandestine labs can vary greatly. Recent information indicates that
methamphetamine is also produced in small batches via a procedure known as the ``cold process.'' This procedure has
utilized quantities of 40 grams or less of ephedrine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The smuggling of bulk ephedrine and the purchase of OTC ephedrine tablets are the primary sources of ephedrine utilized
at these clandestine laboratories. Ephedrine tablets make up a significant portion of the more than 10 metric tons
of ephedrine reportedly seized at clandestine laboratories between 1990 and 1992. This material may be purchased
from several different sources at below threshold quantities. The purchase of regulated chemicals from several
suppliers in quantities below established thresholds is a common method of diversion and continues to occur with
ephedrine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comparison of U.S. hospital/pharmacy purchase data with the quantities of ephedrine seized at clandestine laboratories
indicates that the use of ephedrine for clandestine laboratories is much greater than amounts purchased by these
types of distribution outlets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drug products containing ephedrine are used legitimately to treat asthma and other conditions. They are available
as OTC products from pharmacies, hospitals and other distribution outlets. Ephedrine products, which are lawfully
marketed and distributed under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and contain other active medicinal ingredients
in therapeutically significant concentrations, are currently exempt from the reporting and recordkeeping requirements
imposed under the CDTA. Of the oral OTC products available for medicinal treatment of chronic asthma, these ephedrine
combination products are the products more frequently dispensed by pharmacies and hospitals. The elimination of
a threshold for ephedrine does not impose any additional requirements on pharmacies, hospitals or points of distribution
which distribute only those ephedrine products which are exempted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration, hereby certifies that this proposed rulemaking will
have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This proposed rule only eliminates the existing threshold for which ephedrine transactions must
be reported and records maintained. It only impacts firms involved with small bulk transfers of ephedrine or distribution
of single entity ephedrine tablets/capsules. This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore
need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined
that the proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations set forth certain changes made to the accuracy-related penalty in section 6662 of the
Code by section 13251 of OBRA 1993. These changes eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty
(section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and raised the disclosure standard for purposes of the penalties for disregarding
rules or regulations (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and a substantial understatement of income tax (section 6662(b)(2)
of the Code) from ``not frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis.'' See section 13251 of OBRA 1993 and H. Rep. No. 213, 103rd
Cong., 1st Sess. 669 (1993) (the Conference Report). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history to OBRA 1993 indicates that this ``reasonable basis'' standard is a relatively high standard
of tax reporting that is significantly higher than the ``not frivolous'' disclosure standard previously applicable
to taxpayers under section 6662 of the Code and currently applicable to preparers under section 6694 of the Code. See
Conference Report, at p. 669. A position is not frivolous if it is not ``patently improper.'' See &sect;1.6694&hyph;2(c)(2)
of the Income Tax Regulations and current &sect;1.6662&hyph;3(b)(3). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 also
provides that the reasonable basis standard is not satisfied by a position that is merely arguable or merely a colorable
claim. See Conference Report, at p.669. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adopting the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy
to avoid the disregard and substantial understatement penalties, Congress adopted the new reasonable basis standard
as the standard that a return position must satisfy to avoid the negligence penalty. See Conference Report at p.669.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury requests comments on how the new reasonable basis standard should be defined for purposes of the negligence,
disregard, and substantial understatement penalties.

Explanation of Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.6662&hyph;3(a) of the regulations generally provides that if any portion of an underpayment, as defined
in section 6664(a) of the Code and &sect;1.6664&hyph;2, of any income tax imposed under subtitle A of the Code that
is required to be shown on a return is attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, there is added
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion. Section 1.6662&hyph;3(b)(1) defines ``negligence'' to include
any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue laws or to exercise ordinary
and reasonable care in the preparation of a tax return. Currently, &sect;1.6662&hyph;3(c) generally provides that
no penalty under section 6662(b)(1) may be imposed on any portion of any underpayment that is attributable to negligence
or a position contrary to a rule or regulation if the position is adequately disclosed and is not frivolous, if the requirements
of that section are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.6662&hyph;4(a) of the regulations generally provides that if any portion of an underpayment of any income
tax imposed under subtitle A of the Code that is required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial understatement
of such income tax, there is added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion. Section 1.6662&hyph;4(a)
further provides that, except in the case of any item attributable to a tax shelter, an understatement is reduced by
the portion of the understatement that is attributable to positions for which there was substantial authority or
adequate disclosure. Currently, under &sect;1.6662&hyph;4(e)(2), this adequate disclosure exception will not
apply if the position on the return is frivolous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of OBRA 1993, the minimum standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy to avoid either the penalty
for disregarding rules or regulations or for a substantial understatement of income tax has been raised from ``not
frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis.'' In addition, there is no longer a disclosure exception for the negligence penalty
and, to avoid that penalty, the return position generally must satisfy the new reasonable basis standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules generally apply to returns that are due (without regard to extensions for filing) after December 31, 1993.
However, the rules relating to changes to the penalties for negligence or disregard of rules or regulations will not
apply to returns, including qualified amended returns, filed on or before March 14, 1994.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the adoption of these proposed regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments that are submitted
timely (a signed original and eight copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying in their entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing will be held on July 12, 1994, in the IRS Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building lobby
more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments, an outline of the topics to be
discussed, and the time to be devoted to each topic by June 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed.
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing.

the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty, and providing guidance on the meaning of reasonable basis.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 changes relating to the penalties for negligence or disregard of rules
or regulations will not apply to returns (including qualified amended returns) that are filed on or before March 14,
1994.

section and, in case of a position contrary to a regulation, the position represents a good faith challenge to the validity
of the regulation. This disclosure exception does not apply, however, in the case of a position that does not have a
reasonable basis or where the taxpayer fails to keep adequate books and records or to substantiate items properly.

Disclosure is adequate for purposes of the penalty for disregarding rules or regulations if made in accordance with
the provisions of &sect;&sect;1.6662&hyph;4(f)(1), (3), (4), and (5), which permit disclosure on a properly completed
and filed Form 8275 or 8275&hyph;R, as appropriate. In addition, the statutory or regulatory provision or ruling
in question must be adequately identified on the Form 8275 or 8275&hyph;R, as appropriate. The provisions of &sect;1.6662&hyph;4(f)(2),
which permit disclosure in accordance with an annual revenue procedure for purposes of the substantial understatement
penalty, do not apply for purposes of this section.

Section 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration

adequate information as to the identity and quality of the

Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF has received a petition, dated June 4, 1993, filed on behalf of the Wine Institute, a trade association of California
wineries which represents approximately 80 percent of the total U.S. wine production. According to the petitioner,
a regulatory definition of ``reserve'' is necessary to permit U.S. ``reserve''_designated wines to be sold for export
in European Communities (EC) countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2392/89 of July 24, 1989, Article 26(2)(c) allows for supplemental information
on imported wine labels, subject to certain restrictions. Details ``regarding superior quality'' are allowed on
the label ``in so far as they are prescribed by the national provisions of the third country in which the wine originates
for the domestic market of that country and are recognized by the Community.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has been informed that the EC considers that the term ``reserve'' is a term which refers to ``superior quality.''
In the absence of a regulatory definition of the term ``reserve'' in the U.S., which would apply to wines produced for
domestic consumption, products bearing this term can be prohibited from being sold in EC member countries. The petitioner
states that Germany, for example, prohibits the importation of U.S. wines that bear the term ``reserve'' on the label.
The petition does not state whether other EC member nations have taken this position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner also believes that defining the term in the regulations would provide for uniform meaning and, consequently,
be of benefit to consumers. They contend that the use of the term ``reserve'' is so prolific in the marketplace that
its meaning has been lost, resulting in consumer confusion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In analyzing attempts by foreign countries at defining the term the petitioner has concluded that, although many
foreign countries generally provide for rather broad, subjective tests to determine the ``reserve'' character
of table wine, there is no consistent international standard for use of the term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not defined in the regulations, ATF has permitted the use of such terms as ``reserve,'' ``vintner's select,''
``barrel select,'' ``premium,'' etc. on wine labels. The Bureau considers these terms to be mere ``puffery.'' It
has been ATF's position that consumers recognize these terms as expressing the proprietor's subjective evaluation
of the wine, rather than as terms denoting any objective standards.

Wine Institute Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the reasons mentioned above, the Wine Institute has proposed the following definition for the term ``reserve''
when used on wine labels: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For U.S. appellations, any table wine which is a vintage dated grape table wine that is either varietal, or which contains
multiple varieties where each of the varieties is listed by percentage of total content, may be designated ``reserve''
wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a state, county, or viticultural area may establish more stringent regulations governing the designation
of ``reserve'' under rules and regulations to be established by individual states or local agencies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Wine Institute's proposed definition applies to domestic wines only, ATF notes that any amendment of
the regulations to provide for a definition of the term ``reserve'' would apply to domestic wine, as well as to foreign
wine imported into the U.S. ATF believes that for purposes of consistency a uniform meaning of the term is necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF would also point out that the proposed definition applies to grape table wine only, i.e., grape wine having an alcoholic
content of between 7 and 14 percent by volume. Consequently, if the petitioner's proposed definition is adopted into
the regulations the term could not be used on labels of any other type of wine, such as sparkling wine (e.g., champagne).

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF is requesting information from consumers and industry members on the desirability of amending the regulations
to provide for a definition of the term ``reserve'' when used on wine labels. While ATF has traditionally taken the
position that the use of subjective puffery on the label does not result in consumer confusion, ATF wishes to solicit
comments from both consumers and industry members on whether the term ``reserve'' is being used in a confusing or misleading
fashion on labels. Although ATF is soliciting comments on the following specific questions, the Bureau is also requesting
any relevant information on the subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What does the term ``reserve'' mean to consumers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What does the term mean to members of the wine industry? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Should the term be defined in the wine regulations? If so, should there be a different standard for still wines and
sparkling wines? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Do other similar terms such as ``vintner's select,'' ``barrel select,'' ``premium,'' etc., mean anything to consumers?
What about to members of the industry? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should these terms be defined in the regulations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The term ``reserve'' also appears on labels of malt beverages and distilled spirits. What does it mean to consumers
when it appears on these products? What does it mean to members of the malt beverage and distilled spirits industries
who label their products with this term? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Should the term be defined in the regulations for malt beverages and distilled spirits? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. How much American wine labeled with the ``reserve'' designation is exported into EC member nations? Have exporters
of American wine encountered problems in Germany or any other EC member nations concerning wine which is labeled with
the term ``reserve?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. ATF has observed that the term ``reserve'' often appears on labels of foreign wines imported into the U.S. Do the
countries where these wines originate have any laws or regulations governing the use of this term?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on December 17, 1993 (58 FR 66078), EPA proposed effluent limitations guidelines
and standards for the control of wastewater pollutants and also proposed national emission standards for hazardous
air pollutants. The notice contained some minor errors that are discussed briefly below and are corrected by this
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, EPA recognizes that the record supporting the proposed rulemaking is large and complex. To better facilitate
informed comment, the Agency is extending the comment period by 30 days for a new deadline of April 18, 1994.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission begins implementation of section 9 of the Communications Act of 1934 to assess and collect regulatory
fees. The Commission's objective is to assure that the fee collection process does not have an adverse impact on its
regulatory activities; that fees are collected and deposited in the most cost effective manner possible; and that
fees impose little or no additional paperwork burden on the public. Further, the Commission proposes to amend certain
of its rules governing the collection of fees for applications and other filings under Section 8 of the Communications
Act. We note that the implementation of regulatory fees will further the National Performance Review goals of reinventing
Government by requiring beneficiaries of Commission services to pay for such services.

1. Section 9 of the Communications Act, was added by section 6003(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Section 9(a) authorizes the Commission to assess and collect annual regulatory fees to recover costs incurred in
carrying out its enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international
activities. Section 9(f)(1) provides that ``[t]he Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations
to carry out the provisions of this section.'' The purpose of this Notice is to set forth proposed rules as provided
for in section 9(f)(1). In this Notice, we also propose several conforming and clarifying amendments to our rules
concerning application filing fees, which are assessed and collected pursuant to section 8 of the Communications
Act (``Section 8 fees''). See 47 U.S.C. 158.

Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6002(a), 107 Stat. 397 (approved August 10, 1993). The new Section 9 of the
Communications Act is codified at 47 U.S.C. 159.

Establishment, Adjustment and Amendment of Regulatory Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 9(b)(1)(C) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(C), requires the Commission to collect the
fees established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees in section 9(g), ``until adjusted or amended by the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3)'' of section 9(b). The statutory schedule in section 9(g) lists various regulatory
fee categories under the Commission's Private Radio Bureau, Mass Media Bureau, and Common Carrier Bureau, and it
specifies an annual fee amount for each category. See 47 U.S.C. 159(g); see also Appendix below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The statute requires the Commission, in certain circumstances, to make adjustments or amendments to the Schedule
of Regulatory Fees. First, since regulatory fees must result in collections of amounts that can reasonably be expected
to equal amounts appropriated by Congress, for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1994,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 paragraph (2) of section 9(b) requires the Commission to revise the Schedule of Regulatory Fees by proportionate
increases or decreases to reflect changes in the amount appropriated for that fiscal year for the performance of the
Commission's enforcement, policy and rulemaking, information services, and international activities. Such increases
or decreases shall also reflect unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units subject to regulatory
fees.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Second, amendments to the schedule may also be made to reflect other changes and factors. Paragraph (3) of section
9(b) provides that, ``[i]n addition to the adjustments required by paragraph (2), the Commission shall, by regulation,
amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if the Commission determines that the schedule requires amendment to comply
with the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) [of section 9(b)].''

47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(B). The government's 1994 fiscal year (``FY 1994'') commenced on October 1, 1993, and ends September
30, 1994.

4. For fiscal year 1994, we propose to adopt the fee amounts established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees as approved
by Congress. Adjustments to the statutory schedule required under paragraph (b)(2) may not take place until after
the 1994 fiscal year, and thus we do not have authority during the current fiscal year to revise the schedule for purposes
of matching the amounts actually appropriated for the current fiscal year. With regard to amendments under paragraph
(3) of subsection (b), we similarly believe that the statutory scheme does not envision that the Commission would
exercise its authority to amend the fee amounts in the schedule until at least after FY 1994. Interested parties are
invited to comment on a proposal to adopt the fee amounts set forth in the statutory Schedule of Regulatory Fees.

Exemptions From Regulatory Fees

1. Governmental Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Section 9(h) establishes an exemption from fees for ``governmental entities.'' For purposes of the similar exemption
in section 8, we have defined a governmental entity as any state, possession, city, county, town, village, municipal
corporation or similar political organization or subpart thereof controlled by publicly elected or duly appointed
public officials exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective communities or programs. We
propose to apply the definition contained in our application fee rules to governmental entities exempt from regulatory
fees. See 47 CFR 1.1112(f). The exemptions under section 9 apply to all FCC-regulated services in which governmental
entities operate. Therefore our proposed regulatory fee exemption would apply to applicants, permittees, licensees,
as well as any other regulatees who qualify as governmental entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We must also adopt procedures for identifying regulatees that are governmental entities exempt from regulatory
fees under section 9. Commenters should address the option of requiring entities, in lieu of the required fee, to file
certifications (or other relevant information) as to their exempt status. Alternatively, for those governmental
entities that have already established their governmental status for purposes of section 8 filing fees, we may determine,
to the extent possible, that no additional filings are necessary.

2. Nonprofit Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Section 9(h) also establishes an exemption from regulatory fees for all ``nonprofit entities.'' In contrast,
section 8(d)(1)(A), governing exemptions from application fees, exempts from application fees only those nonprofit
entities licensed in Special Emergency Radio or Public Safety Radio services. Further, the statutory exemption
of ``nonprofit entities'' is clearly broader than the current exemption in the mass media services covering noncommercial,
educational broadcast stations and limited categories of other facilities. See 47 CFR 1.1112.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In applying the exemption for these nonprofit entities under section 8, we have interpreted the term ``nonprofit
entities'' to mean entities that receive nonprofit, tax exempt status under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code,
26 U.S.C. 501. We propose, therefore, to interpret the term ``nonprofit entities'' to include all nonprofit organizations
exempt under section 501.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Under our section 8 fee rules, an applicant claiming nonprofit status must include a current IRS Determination
Letter documenting its nonprofit status. We seek to avoid unnecessary paperwork, to the extent possible, by relying
on existing information in Bureau files to identify regulatees that are nonprofit entities exempt from regulatory
fees under section 9. However, since the exemption under section 8(d) only applies to nonprofit entities licensed
in the Special Emergency Radio or Public Safety Radio services, we propose to require any other regulatee seeking
an exemption as nonprofit entity to file, in lieu of the required fee, a current IRS Determination Letter documenting
its nonprofit status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Section 9(h) also provides a specific statutory exemption for ``amateur radio operation licenses under part
97 of the Commission's regulations.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(h)(2). The Schedule of Regulatory Fees does establish a fee category
for ``Amateur vanity call-signs.'' We have proposed new rules in PR Docket No. 93&hyph;305 that would allow vanity
call-signs. See Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 9 FCC Rcd 105, 59 FR 558 (Jan. 5, 1994). After those rules (if adopted)
become effective, amateur licensees requesting vanity call-signs will be required to pay the statutory fee under
section 9.

12. Similarly, we believe that Congress intended to exempt noncommercial secondary and auxiliary broadcast services,
such as low power television (``LPTV'') stations, television translators and boosters, remote pickup stations
and intercity relay stations. This interpretation is consistent with our interpretation of the application fee
provisions in section 8. Accordingly, we propose to utilize our current noncommercial exemption for LPTV and translator
stations for regulatory fees. We also propose to utilize this fee exemption for boosters, auxiliary broadcast services,
and other Mass Media, Common Carrier or Private Radio authorizations used in conjunction with qualifying noncommercial
educational radio, television, or instructional services.

13. Finally, it does not appear that Congress intended that a noncommercial exemption for regulatory fees be available
to international short-wave broadcast stations. As was the case when we were implementing section 8, we do not intend
to provide a noncommercial exemption for international broadcast licensees.

14. As with the exemption for governmental and nonprofit entities, to avoid unnecessary paperwork and to the extent
possible, we propose to rely on information currently in Bureau files to identify most noncommercial licensees and
permittees. However, where necessary, we reserve the option of requiring such entities, in lieu of paying the required
fee, to file certifications (and other relevant information) as to their noncommercial status.

15. The Schedule of Regulatory Fees does not list specific Private Radio services under the category of ``Shared use
services.'' See 47 U.S.C. 159(g). In this regard, however, the legislative history clearly states that Congress
intended to exempt public safety licensees from regulatory fees. Accordingly, we propose to exempt all licensees
in the Public Safety Radio and Special Emergency Radio Services from regulatory fees, but we also seek comment on whether
the exemption should be limited to governmental and nonprofit entities, which are explicitly mentioned in the statute's
exemptions.

Waivers, Reductions and Deferments of Regulatory Fees

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

16. Section 9(d) states that ``[t]he Commission may waive, reduce, or defer payment of a fee in any specific instance
for good cause shown, where such action would promote the public interest.'' 47 U.S.C. 15(d). This provision is similar
to section 8(d)(2), which we have interpreted narrowly. Specifically, we stated that, under section 8(d)(2), we
would permit waivers or deferments on a case-by-case basis in extraordinary and compelling circumstances upon a
showing that a waiver or deferment would override the public interest in reimbursing the Commission for its regulatory
costs. We propose to apply this same narrow interpretation to our implementation of section 9(d) and thus propose
to grant waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees only in such unusual circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. As discussed below, small regulatory fees generally must be paid at the time applications are filed. When regulatory
fees are due at the same time an application is filed, we propose, when processing requests for regulatory fee waivers,
reductions or deferments, to use procedures similar to those now used for application fee waiver requests. See 47
CFR 1.1115(e). Applicants seeking application fee waivers must submit both the request for waiver and the required
fee, accompanied by the required form(s). Applications that do not include these materials are dismissed in accordance
with section 1.1107 of the rules. For regulatory fees that are supposed to accompany applications, we would also require
regulatees seeking a waiver or reduction to submit their regulatory fee payment with their waiver request. Similarly,
for standard regulatory fees that are due on a certain date, we propose to require that the appropriate regulatory
fee accompany any waiver or reduction request. The regulatory fees submitted would be refunded later if a waiver or
reduction were granted. Requests for deferment would have to be filed and approved before the payment due date in order
to avoid late payment penalties.

18. Section 9(f) of the Communications Act provides that the Commission's regulations implementing regulatory
fees must ``permit payment by installments in the case of fees in large amounts, and in the case of fees in small amounts,
shall require the payment of the fee in advance for a number of years not to exceed the term of the license held by the payor.''
47 U.S.C. 159(f)(1). We propose to establish three classes of regulatory fees, each of which would be based on the size
of the annual fee amount. The three classes of regulatory fees are standard fees, small fees and large fees. The class
of the fee would determine the timing of the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 fee payment. Pursuant to section 9(f), our regulations will permit regulatees subject to ``large'' fees to make two
installment payments in FY 1994 (rather than single payment). Regulatees subject to ``small'' fees will have to pay
their fees for each year of their license term in advance at the beginning of the license term. Regulatees subject to
standard fees would pay their regulatory fee, in full, on an annual basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. We propose to classify most of the fee amounts which will be paid under section 9 as standard fees. Standard regulatory
fees would be those that are neither ``large'' nor ``small.'' (The proposed definitions of these terms are discussed
below.) As noted above, standard fees are to be paid in full on an annual basis. We propose further that each licensee
or regulatee required to pay a standard fee must pay the full amount specified for each relevant fee category by a date
certain each year. The specific payment due dates for each regulatory fee category for the 1994 fiscal year will be
announced in the Report and Order in this proceeding or in a Public Notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be released well before the first payment due date. We anticipate that all regulatory fees will be collected as early
as possible before the end of the fiscal year. In subsequent fiscal years, we intend to establish regular, fixed payment
due dates for regulatory fees.

b. Installment Payments for Large Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. Section 9(f) states that the Commission's regulations shall permit payment by installments for regulatory fees
in ``large amounts.'' However, nowhere in the statute or the legislative history did Congress define the term ``large.''
For purposes of establishing eligibility criteria for FY 1994 for regulatory fee installment payments, we propose
generally to classify a fee amount as ``large'' if it greatly exceeds the average annual fee for regulatees in a particular
category. Specifically, for some regulatory fee categories, we propose to establish a fixed annual amount which
is based on the relative payment obligations of regulatees within that regulatory fee category. Those fees which
are significantly higher than all others would be deemed large and entities who are required to pay significantly
more than most other regulatees may elect to make two payments in FY 1994 instead of paying the entire amount all at once.
For future years, we seek comment on whether large fee payors should be permitted to pay their annual regulatory fee
in four or more installments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. We propose that an entity's installment payment eligibility should not be based on its total regulatory fee payments
because it happens to hold multiple licenses or authorizations or serve multiple areas. Instead, a regulatory fee
would be deemed large based on the fee for each individual license, authorization or authorized service area. If,
for example, the regulatory fee is large (as defined herein) for one or more of a regulatee's licenses and not for other
licenses, the regulatee will be eligible for installment payments only for those large fee licenses and must pay the
entire regulatory fee for all of the other licenses. We invite specific comment on whether, for purposes of determining
whether fees are large, telephone local exchange carriers should be assessed fees on an operating company or holding
company level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. In applying the method described above, we propose several ``large'' fee amounts that would be eligible for installment
payments. In sum, for the 1994 fiscal year we have identified the following fee amounts as large:

When compared with the amounts to be paid by the average regulatee in these categories, these regulatory fee amounts
appear significantly higher.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. If a regulatee finds it necessary to pay its large regulatory fee by installments, we propose to establish fixed
dates on which installment payments will be due. For the 1994 fiscal year, any eligible regulatee that elects to pay
a large fee in installments shall make half of its payment on a date to be specified. We also shall specify the date for
the second and final installment. Payments in their entirety will be due prior to the end of this fiscal year. As with
standard fees, the payment due dates for each large fee category for the 1994 fiscal year will be announced in the Report
and Order in this proceeding or in a

 to be released well before the first installment payment due date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. To recover the additional costs of maintaining installment payment plans, we propose that each installment payment
would be subject to an additional processing charge to cover administrative costs. We tentatively propose that these
fees will be $50.00 per payment. Installment payments received after the due date for standard regulatory fees would
be subject to interest payments.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Further, as discussed below, late installment payments would be subject to a 25 percent late fee and applications
filed by delinquent payers would be subject to dismissal. We would also reserve the right to require a regulatee to
pay its regulatory fees in a single, full payment if one or more installment payments has not been received in a timely
manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. Section 9(f) states that the Commission's regulations shall require the payment of ``small'' regulatory fees
``in advance for a number of years not to exceed the term of the license held by the payor.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(f)(1). Based
on the legislative history, for the 1994 fiscal year we propose to require advance payment for regulatory fees in Private
Radio services. Due to the large volume of Private Radio licensees and other authorizations, we believe that assessment
and collection of these small regulatory fees on an annual basis would be very costly and would likely result in a larger
number of delinquent payments unless such payments coincide with the beginning of the license term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. We propose to require those who are assessed a small regulatory fee to pay their annual fee for their entire license
or authorization term. These regulatory fees would generally be paid concurrently with an applicant's new, renewal
or reinstatement application. We propose to require persons holding lifetime restricted radiotelephone and radio
operator licenses or permits for commercial use to pay a one-time regulatory fee of $105.00 to cover the entire lifetime
license or permit term. If the fee amount is adjusted subsequent to a regulatee's advance payment, the regulatee would
not be subject to the new fee amount until its next renewal application and regulatory fee is due. Regulatees thus would
only be subject to the fee amounts in effect for the fiscal year in which their application is filed. Finally, for the
first round of fee payments for regulatees in the private radio service, we may require payments subsequent to the
time when the application is actually filed.

We note that some existing private radio licensees will be reclassified as Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS)
providers pursuant to section 332 of the Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. 332(c), (d). To the extent that private radio
licensees will have paid their ``small'' fees in advance for the term of their licenses, we would apply the advanced
payment toward any new regulatory fee requirement imposed upon such licensees as a result of being reclassified as
CMRS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. We propose to use the same general requirements and procedures for the payment of both application fees and regulatory
fees. First, in addition to the payment methods in section 1.1108(a) of our Rules, we propose to allow the filing of
fee payments by electronic means. We will first allow electronic fee payments only on a limited, experimental basis.
We also propose to allow payment by credit card in some circumstances. The credit cards which will be accepted are VISA
and Mastercard. When a credit card is employed for a fee payment, the entire fee payment must be made by a single credit
card transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. Second, we propose to allow the use of one payment instrument to cover multiple standard regulatory fee payments
and, where applicable, multiple installments.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Our new remittance form and payment procedures would allow individual entities to use a single payment method or instrument
to pay the standard regulatory fees for each Mass Media and Common Carrier license or authorization it holds. Each
individual regulatee will be solely responsible for accurately accounting for and listing each license or authorization
and the number of subscribers, antennas, access lines, or other relevant units, and for paying the proper cumulative
amount by the single instrument.

Since small regulatory fees will be paid at the same time as application fees, our current application fee-filing
procedures requiring one instrument per application would apply. However, we are proposing below to modify the one-instrument/one-application
rule to allow one payment instrument to cover multiple applications filed in the same bank lockbox.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
29. Finally, in order to efficiently process Mass Media and Common Carrier regulatory fee payments, we propose to
set up a single lockbox at the lockbox bank, separate from the lockboxes established for applications and application
fees. Regulatory fee payments for both services are to be submitted to this lockbox. This will allow regulatees in
the Mass Media and Common Carrier services to combine payments for different fee categories. However, since regulatory
fees for Private Radio services will be due at the same time as applications and application fees, these regulatory
fees, must be paid to the same lockbox as the application fees. Because they are paid to different lockboxes, Private
Radio fees may not be combined with Mass Media and Common Carrier regulatory fees. We request comments on the above
proposals.

Enforcement of Regulatory Fees Statute and Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30. Section 9(c) of the Communication Act provides the Commission with three methods of enforcing the statute: monetary
penalties for late payment, dismissal of applications, and revocation. 47 U.S.C. 159(c). In order to ensure an effective
regulatory fee collection program, we intend to use these enforcement mechanisms to the fullest extent possible.
In addition, the Commission will pursue all available remedies against delinquent payers under the Debt Collection
Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
31. We propose to incorporate section 9(c)(1) into our rules. Thus, we will charge a 25 percent penalty to any regulatee
that fails to pay its regulatory fee (or installment) in a timely manner. We intend to consider a payment to be late,
or ``not paid in a timely manner,'' if the full regulatory fee amount or the entire installment payment is not received
at the lockbox bank by the due date specified by the Commission. A payment would also be considered late if the payment
(check, bank draft or other means) is not collectible.

32. If a regulatory fee is not paid in a timely manner, we will make every effort to identify delinquent payors and to
notify them of their delinquency as soon as possible. This notice will, pursuant to the statute, automatically assess
the 25 percent penalty and, as proposed below will require the delinquent payor to pay the fee and penalty, may subject
the delinquent payors' pending applications to dismissal, and may require a delinquent payor to show cause why its
existing instruments of authorization should not be subject to revocation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
33. Section 9(c)(2) authorizes the Commission to dismiss any application, group of applications or other filings
for failure to pay in a timely manner any fee or penalty under section 9. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(2). Because application and
regulatory fees may be combined, we propose that, where a regulatory fee is required to accompany a regulatee's new
or renewal application (as is the case with the small fees), the application will be returned if the regulatory fee
is not included. If the application that must be accompanied by a regulatory fee is a mutually exclusive application
with a filing deadline (or any other application that must be filed by a date certain), we also propose to dismiss the
application if not accompanied by the regulatory fee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Revocation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
34. Section 9(c)(3) provides that, `[i]n addition to or in lieu of'' the 25 percent penalty required by section 9(c)(1)
and the application(s) dismissal authorized by section 9(c)(2), ``the Commission may revoke any instrument of authorization
held by any entity that has failed to make payment of a regulatory fee assessed pursuant to this section.'' 47 U.S.C.
159(c)(3). The statute specifies that the Commission must provide notice to the licensee of the Commission's intent
to take such action and must allow the licensee at least 30 days to either pay the fee or show cause why the fee does not
apply to the licensee or should otherwise be waived or payment deferred. A hearing is not required under this revocation
provision unless the licensee's response presents a ``substantial and material question of fact.'' In any case where
a hearing is conducted, it shall be based on written evidence only, and the burden of proceeding with the introduction
of evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. While we do not foresee that revocation will be necessary except in egregious circumstances, we reserve the right
to invoke these abbreviated revocation proceedings against any delinquent regulatee. We note that this provision
requires only that a regulatee ``has failed to make 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
payment of a regulatory fee.'' Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(emphasis added). It does not require ``willful or repeated'' failure to pay. Compare 47 U.S.C. 312(a) (3), (4) and
(7). Therefore, if we deem it appropriate, our notification to a regulatee that is delinquent with its regulatory
fee payment will take the form of an ``Order to Show Cause,'' allowing the regulatee to either pay the fee or show cause
why the fee does not apply or should otherwise be waived or payment deferred. We propose to provide a 60 day period for
a reply by the subject regulatee in order to afford an adequate opportunity for the regulatee to obtain any necessary
financing of its fee payment and to otherwise prepare its response.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
36. In addition to the above-described remedies under section 9(c), we intend to invoke our authority under the Debt
Collection Act against any person or entity failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations. See 31 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with part 1, subpart 0 of our rules (47 CFR &sect;&sect;1.1901&hyph;1.1952), we intend to pursue the
collection of outstanding debts arising from regulatory fee payment failures at the same time we proceed against
the debtor with the other sanctions authorized by section 9(c). Moreover, where circumstances require, we will refer
outstanding debts to the Internal Revenue Service. See 31 U.S.C. &sect;3720A.

Explanation of Regulatory Fee Categories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
37. An explanation of regulatory fee categories is contained in the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and
is based on the categories established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees in section 9(g) of the Communications Act.
47 U.S.C. 159(g). Where regulatory fee categories from the schedule need additional interpretation or clarification,
we have relied on the legislative history of section 9 and our own experience in establishing and regulating the various
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

38. The two levels of statutory fees for Private Radio services, exclusive use service and shared use services, were
established on the basis that those licensees who generally receive a higher quality communications channel, due
to exclusive or lightly shared frequency assignments, will pay a higher fee than those who share marginal quality
channels. In addition, as noted above, because of the relatively small annual fee amounts in the Private Radio Services,
applicants for a new license, reinstatement and renewal will be required to pay a regulatory fee covering an entire
license term, with only a percentage of all licensees paying a regulatory fee in any one year. Applications for modification
or assignment of an existing authorization do not require payment of a regulatory fee. The expiration date of these
authorizations will not reflect a new license term when either modifications or assignments are processed. In an
effort to reduce public confusion, the Commission has provided separate lockbox addresses for these applications.

39. Television stations. As discussed above, we propose to allow installment payments for regulatory fees if a television
licensee's annual fee exceeds $12,000. We propose that this amount be deemed large because it greatly exceeds the
estimated average regulatory fee obligations to be incurred by most other television licensees. Specifically,
according to our estimates, the 551 commercial VHF television licensees will pay an average fee of $8,826. Most VHF
licensees (379, or 69 percent) will pay $8,000 or under in fiscal year 1994 and only 18.5 percent of VHF licensees will
be asked to pay over $12,000. Similarly, under the statutory schedule 561 commercial UHF television licensees will
pay an average fee of $8,294. The vast majority of UHF licensees (406, or 72 percent) will pay under $10,000 in fiscal
year 1994 and only 27.63 percent of UHF licensees will be asked to pay over $12,000. Thus, we tentatively conclude that
television licensees subject to a regulatory fee above $12,000 will be automatically eligible to make two equal installment
payments, subject to additional administrative and interest charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. In determining a TV station's market rank, the Commission has traditionally relied on the Arbitron Company's
publication ``Television Markets and Ranking Guide.'' See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.q,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;&sect;73.658(k) note 1 (prime-time access rule). We note, however, that Arbitron has recently announced
that it will no longer provide television ratings services. See Cooper, Arbitron Drops Local TV and Cable Ratings,
Broadcasting &amp; Cable, Oct. 25, 1993, at 45. Thus, we seek comment on whether we should rely on the latest Arbitron
publication's rankings which would be placed in our rules (see, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.q.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 47 CFR 76.51 (major television markets)), or should we use some other source (such a A.C. Nielsen) to determine a television
station's market ranking reach year for purposes of assessing regulatory fees. In this regard, we tentatively conclude
that we will need to rely on the most recent market rankings to assess fees each fiscal year because a static list in our
rules may become outdated after a few years. Thus, any changes in market rankings may affect regulatory fee amounts
for the following fiscal year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
41. Cable television systems. We seek comment on how to verify a cable television operator's regulatory fee obligation,
which, as noted is based on its total number of subscribers. We propose to initially rely on a cable operator's good
faith representation on its fee remittance form as to the number of subscribers it has as of the date of its annual regulatory
fee payment. We also intend to perform random audits to determine whether individual cable systems have based their
fee payments on the correct number of subscribers. Commenters are invited to suggest other alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. As indicated above, we propose to allow installment payments for these regulatory fees if a cable television system's
annual fee exceed $18,500.00 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
systems with more than 50,000 subscribers).
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 We propose that this amount be considered large in this context in part because it significantly exceeds the estimated
average fee that will be paid by most cable systems. Specifically, according to our estimates, the average fee in this
category will be approximately $1,914.00 in FY 1994. However, a relatively few systems (approximately 2 percent
of all systems) will be subject to fees over $18,500.00 and significantly above the $1,914.00 average. These systems
will pay, on average, a fee of approximately $36,000. Thus, we believe that $18,500 is a reasonable cut-off. Therefore,
pursuant to the statute, we propose to permit cable systems whose regulatory fee for FY 1994 exceeds $18,500 to pay
in two equal installments on the dates later specified by the Commission, subject to additional administrative and
interest charges. We invite comment on this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
43. Most common carrier regulatory fees are based on the size of a regulatee's communication operation as determined
by number of stations, subscribers, access lines, or antennas. We intend to rely on the Bureau's licensing data bases
to confirm the identity and fee amount for most radio common carriers, to the extent possible. However, where the Commission
does not have information on hand to verify a regulatory fee multiplier (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 number of subscribers), we intend to rely on the good faith representations made on a regulatee's fee remittance form.
We also intend to perform random audits to determine whether individual regulatees have reported the correct multiplier.
Additionally, we request comment with respect to how well the specific regulatory fee multiplier set forth in the
statutory schedule are ``reasonable related to the benefits provided'' to regulatees.

 Commenters should proposed specific alternatives, which we may either recommend to Congress as technical amendments
to the statutory schedule or incorporate into our own schedule of regulatory fees.

 pending (broadband PCS). The statutory Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted in the 1993 Budget Act established an
annual fee of $60.00 per 1000 subscribers for PCS licensees. At the same time, the 1993 Budget Act recognized that PCS
licenses have not yet been issued. In particular, Congress directed the Commission to conclude its PCS rulemaking
proceedings (Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100) by February 6, 1994, and to commence the PCS
licensing process by May 7, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, our new PCS service rules provide licensees five years to meet minimum construction requirements. Accordingly,
since it is unlikely that may PCS licensee will have a significant number of subscribers in the immediate future, we
tentatively conclude that no regulatory fees will be collected from PCS licensees during the 1994 fiscal year. We
intend to begin assessing and collecting regulatory fees for PCS in the 1995 fiscal year.

45. Space stations. Domestic and international non-geostationary satellites, positioned in a low-earth orbit
(``LEO''), may be authorized to transmit to satellites and fixed or mobile earth stations. These services include
the new non-vioice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service in bands below 1 GHz, see Report and Order, CC Docket
No. 92&hyph;76, 8 FCC Rcd 8450, 58 FR 68053 (Dec. 23, 1993) and Mobile Satellite Services in bands above 1 Ghz, see Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 92&hyph;166, FCC 94&hyph;11 (released Feb. 18, 1994). Entities authorized
to operate LEO systems will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $90,000.00 for each such system. We note that the
Commission's new rules do not define how many space stations in low-earth orbit would constitute a ``system.'' See
Below 1 GHZ Report and Order at para. 3. Although no LEO systems are currently operational, for purposes of assessing
regulatory fees, we propose to require a LEO operator to begin paying annual regulatory fees in the fiscal year in which
they launch the first satellite in their system even though all the space stations specified in its application or
instrument of authorization have not become operational. We request comment on this proposal. While it appears unlikely
that a LEO system will be launched in the 1994 fiscal year, should be LEO system be launched during that period, we tentatively
propose to collect a regulatory fee for such launched systems and request comment on whether the entire annual fee
amount should be required or if the fee should be assessed on a pro-rata basis.

46. Interexchange and local exchange carriers. For FY 1994, interexchange carriers (long distance telephone companies)
(``IXCs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $60.00 per 1,000 presubscribed access lines. Similarly,
local exchange carriers (local telephone operating companies) (``LECs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory
fee of $60.00 per 1,000 access lines. As noted above, for IXCs, we have identified regulatory fee payment amounts greater
than $500,000.00 as large. For LEC holding companies, we have identified $700,000.00 as a large amount. Thus, we propose
to permit IXCs whose annual regulatory fee exceed $500,000.00 and LEC holding companies whose fee payments exceed
$700,000 to make installment payments. A relatively small number of companies will incur annual fees in excess of
these amounts compared with many other entities who are subject to much lower fees. Specifically, we have estimated
that the average fee for all interexchange carriers will be approximately $20,000. However, the top three carriers
will be paying from $530,000 to $6 million dollars per year in regulatory fees. The estimated average fee for only the
top 20 local exchange carriers is approximately $417,000. We have tentatively chosen as a logical cut-off point $700,000
because only a few carriers will pay this above-average fee and the vast majority of carriers will pay a fee that is significantly
below the top 20 average fee. In fiscal year 1994, large fees may be paid in two installments. Given the higher annual
operating revenues of these types of companies, we also believe that the proposed amounts for ``large'' fees are appropriate
in this context.

Conforming and Clarifying Amendments to Application Fee Rules

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47. In addition to the new rules for regulatory fees, we are proposing to revise several sections of our rules governing
the payment and collection of fees associated with applications and other filings. As noted above, these fees are
assessed and collected pursuant to section 8 of the Communications Act and are separate and apart from the regulatory
fees authorized under section 9. However where appropriate, our section 7 and section 9 fee collection procedures
will be integrated. For the most part, the proposed modifications related to our filing fees are ministerial in nature
to conform our application fee and regulatory fee regulations or will clarify existing fee payment requirements.

Fees for resubmitted applications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 First, we propose to amend section 1.1107(d) of the rules, which governs fee payments relating to applications and
other filings when resubmitted in the appropriate timeframe following a staff request for additional or corrected
information. Ordinarily, no additional fee payment is required for resubmitted applications and other filings.
However, the rules do require a supplemental fee payment whenever the revised information causes a change in the category
of the filing with the result that a higher fee payment is now due under the fee schedule. Our rules provide that the additional
fee payment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the difference between the fee initially submitted and the correct fee payment now due, must be submitted with the
revised application or other filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49. In order to clarify our rule governing those procedures applicable when an additional fee is due, we propose to
amend &sect;1.1107(d) to require persons submitting revised applications and other filings to submit any fee payment
balance due when the revised application or other filing is submitted. Such applications and fees must be filed at
the lockbox bank. In the event that the staff discovers, within 30 days after the resubmission, that the additional
fee payment was not submitted, the application or other filing will be dismissed as deficient and the previously submitted
section 8 fee payment will be retained under this proposal. A new fee payment (covering the entire amount) will be required
with any future filing of the application or other filing. However, if the staff discovers the fee payment deficiency
more than thirty days subsequent to the resubmission, the application or other filing will be retained but a 25 percent
late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if the Commission has completed its action on the application
or other filing involved.

Stale checks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's correspondent bank for fee collections will not process a personal or business check dated more
than six months prior to its submission. Therefore, we propose to revise &sect;1.1108(a) of the rules to make clear
that these ``stale'' checks will not be accepted as fee payments. Under this revision, and consistent with the Uniform
Commercial Code, we will not accept any instrument of payment dated more than six months prior to the date of its filing
with the lockbox bank, and we will return to the filer any application or other filing submitted with a stale payment
instrument.

Receipts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Next, with regard to receipts requested for application fee payments, the Commission's practice is to furnish receipts
only upon specific requests of the submitter rather than to provide receipts automatically for all fee payments received.
We propose to clarify these procedures by amending &sect;1.1108 of the rules. In order to obtain a receipt for a fee
payment, we propose to require that the application and fee package include a copy of the first page of the application
or other filing, clearly marked ``copy'', submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing.
The copy should be the top document in the fee payment package. The staff will date-stamp the copy immediately and provide
it to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through
return mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain
the date stamped copy of the application. We do not intend to provide receipts for regulatory fee payments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Electronic payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, pursuant to our proposal above regarding the submission of regulatory fee payments by electronic means,
we propose to amend &sect;&sect;1.1107 and 1.1108 of the rules to allow the payment of application and other filing
fees by electronic means. Although such a system for electronic payment is not yet in place, we believe that it is appropriate
in this proceeding, and in conjunction with the development of our pilot project, to propose changing these rules
at this time and to seek comment on one particular aspect of this payment method as it specifically applies to applications
and other filings. Specifically, we are concerned about matching electronically paid fees with submitted hard-copy
applications. If a party chooses to pay its application filing fee electronically, we believe that it should follow
existing procedures for filing its application at the lockbox bank. However, in lieu of the current payment methods,
the party will indicate on its remittance advice (FCC Form 159 or the underlying application form with fee information
incorporated therein) that payment is being sent to the bank electronically. We tentatively conclude that in such
situations the electronic payment must be made on or before the day the application is filed. Upon receipt of an application,
the bank will confirm that a fee payment has been received electronically. If the electronic payment is not received
on the filing date, the application or request would be returned without processing. We believe these procedures
are necessary to ensure the most efficient processing of electronic fee payments (when authorized) and applications
or other filings. Finally, during the pilot phase of our electronic payment program, regulatees will be required
to obtain our authorization before making electronic fee payments.

One-check/one-application rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to modify our rules to allow the use of a single payment instrument or method to cover multiple applications
for the same or different applicants, so long as all the applications are filed at the same time at the same lockbox.
Any applicant desiring to pay for multiple regulatory/application filings in the same lockbox with a single payment
instrument, or when paying by credit card, must also complete FCC Form 159, FCC Remittance Advice. Each item must be
listed separately on the form with its own Payment Type Code. If another space is needed for multiple filings, the applicant
must use FCC Form 159&hyph;S, FCC Supplemental Remittance Advice.

All non-private radio section 9 regulatory fee payers must use FCC Form 159/159S when submitting single or multiple
regulatory fees. Under current application fee rules, applicants are required to submit one check and one application.
However, effective April 1, 1994, applicants will also be allowed to pay for multiple filings in the same lockbox with
a single payment instrument. These applicants must also use FCC Form 159/159S for multiple filings.

Payment by cashier's check required. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.1108(d)(1)(i) of the Commission's Rules provides that payment of fees by cashier's check may be required
when a person or organization has, on two or more occasions, made payment with a payment instrument on which the Commission
does not receive final payment and such failure is not excused by bank error. 47 CFR 1.1108(d)(1)(i); see also

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;1.1110(a). Under these circumstances, the Commission will send a letter detailing the terms and conditions
of future payments, including a requirement that no form of payment, other than a cashier's check is acceptable. Despite
this apparently strict response to ``bounced'' checks and other insufficient payment instruments, we continue
to receive numerous checks that are not drawn on sufficient funds for payment. To ensure that payment instruments
will result in a final payment being made to the Commission, we believe that our cashier's check safeguard should be
strengthened. Accordingly, we propose that, when a person or organization has, on a single occasion, submitted a
payment instrument on which final payment is not received (and not excused by bank error), we will immediately notify
the party that future fee payments must be made by cashier's check. If, subsequent to such notice, payment is not made
by a cashier's check, that party's other payment instrument will not be accepted and its application or other filing
will be returned.

Filing locations for petitions, waivers, and deferrals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, we will be making a few ministerial changes to the rules. Specifically, we will revise &sect;&sect;1.1109(a)(3)
and 1.1115 to clarify that any petition for reconsideration, application for review, and any petition for waiver
or deferral of a fee payment, accompanied by an application or regulatory fee payment, must be submitted to the lockbox
bank. If no fee payment is required and the matter is within the scope of the fee rules, the petition or application for
review should be filed with the Secretary and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director. Petitions
for deferral or waiver for which no fee payment is required should also be directed to the attention of the Managing
Director.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 17, 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule (57 FR 27094) amending regulations
pertaining to the humane and healthful transport of wild mammals and birds to the United States. That rule became effective
September 15, 1992. That rule, 50 CFR part 14 subpart J, incorporates by reference the 18th edition of the Live Animal
Regulations (LAR) of the International Air Transport Association, such that all primary enclosures used to transport
live wild mammals or birds to the United States are required to comply with the Container Requirements of the 18th LAR.
Since the publication of the final rule, IATA has published the 20th edition of the LAR, effective October 1, 1993.
The 20th LAR contains no major substantive differences from the 18th LAR, but does clarify some of the Container Requirements.
When the public orders the LAR from IATA, they can only obtain the 20th edition. If the public complies with the 20th
LAR, they will satisfy all of the requirements of the final rule for the Humane and Healthful Transport of Wild Mammals
and Birds (50 CFR part 14). This proposal to incorporate by reference the 20th edition of the LAR is therefore for the
convenience of the public and in order to facilitate consistency and enforceability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document is not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This proposed
revision is a technical amendment that allows the regulation to conform with the current edition of a publication
that has been incorporated by reference, which will make compliance and enforcement more practical and efficient.
Also, this current action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630,
since compliance with the revised regulations will have neither greater nor lesser effect on constitutionally protected
individual property rights. The revision to Part 14 certified not to have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities as described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Small entities are already required to comply
with the current regulations and the 18th edition of the IATA Live Animals Regulations. It is expected that the revisions
would reduce the burden on small entities by adopting the current edition of the industry guidelines rather than imposing
a requirement for an outdated version. Since the rule applies to importations of live wildlife into the United States,
it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Army announces a revision and consolidation of 32 CFR parts 536, Claims Against the United States
and 537, Claims on Behalf of the United States in order to bring them in line with new policies and procedures being promulgated
in Army Regulation 27&hyph;20, Claims. This revision retains part 536 as The Army Claims System. Part 537 will be removed
and held in reserve for future use. This part prescribes the policies, procedures, and responsibilities for investigating,
processing, and settling claims against and in favor of the United States under the authority conferred by certain
statutes, regulations, international and interdepartmental agreements, and Department of Defense directives.
It is intended to ensure that claims are properly investigated, adjudicated objectively and fairly, and either paid
or collection action initiated. Because of the complexity and length of changes and consolidation of parts 536 and
537, a breakout of the scope or responsibilities of each subpart to this whole part is listed in the Supplemental Information
part of this submission. JAG offices, individuals and/or organizations currently using Army Regulation 27&hyph;20
or the current issue of 32 CFR part 536 and 537, dated 1 July 1993, should review this revision against the current versions
in order to determine the additions, deletions or other changes being made. By reviewing the supplemental information
portion, reading of the complete part becomes necessary in order to understand the entire part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Subpart A). Subpart A is the introduction of part 536. (Subpart B). Subpart B describes the investigation and processing
of claims investigation and the importance of claims investigation. (Subpart C). This subpart is applicable in all
locations and prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the settlement of claims
against the United States for death; personal injury; or damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by military
personnel or civilian employees of the DA acting within the scope of their employment and incident to the noncombat
activities of the DA, provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast
Guard or civilian officer or employee whose injury or death is incident to service. (Subpart D). This subpart prescribes
the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement of claims against
the United States under the FTCA and the implementing Attorney General's Regulations based on death, personal injury,
or damage to or loss of property that accrues on or after 18 January 1967. (Subpart E). This subpart prescribes the substantive
bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement and payment, in an amount not more than
$1,000, of any claim against the United States not cognizable under any other provision of law for damage or loss of
property, or for personal injury or death caused by a member or employee of the DA incident to the use of a U.S. vehicle
at any location or incident to the use of other U.S. property on a Government installation. (Subpart F). This subpart
is applicable in all places and sets forth the procedures to be followed in the settlement and payment of claims for
death, personal injury, or damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by members or employees of the Army National
Guard; noncombat activities of the Army National Guard when engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. provided such
claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard and an employee whose injury or
death is incident to service. (Subpart G). This subpart provides procedures and defines responsibilities for the
investigation, processing, and settlement of claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of a foreign military
force or civilian component present in the United States, or a territory, commonwealth, or possession thereof under
the provisions of reciprocal international agreements which contain claims settlement provisions applicable
to claims arising in the United States such as Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Status of Forces of Parties
to the North Atlantic Treaty. (Subpart H). This subpart deals with claims against the United States. Title 10, U.S.C.,
section 4802, provides for the settlement or compromise of claims for damage caused by a vessel of, or in the service
of, the Department of the Army (DA) or by other property under the jurisdiction of the DA; compensation for towage and
salvage service, including contract salvage, rendered to a vessel of, or in the service of, the DA or other property
under the jurisdiction of the DA or damage caused by a maritime tort committed by any agent or employee of the DA or by
property under the jurisdiction of the DA. (Subpart I). This subpart sets for the standards to be applied and the procedures
to be followed in the processing of claims for damage, loss, or destruction of property owned by or in the lawful possession
of an individual whether civilian or military, a business, a charity, or a State or local government, where the property
was wrongfully taken or willfully damaged by military members of DA. (Subpart J). This subpart implements the Foreign
Claims Act (FCA) and authorizes the administrative settlement of claims of inhabitants of a foreign country, or by
a foreign country or a political subdivision thereof, against the United States for personal injury or death or property
damages caused outside the United States, its territories, commonwealths, or possessions by military personnel
or civilian employees of the DA, or claims which arise incident to noncombat activities of the Army. (Subpart K). This
subpart deals with personal claims and related recovery actions, delegation of authority and prescribes the substantive
bases and special procedural rules for the administrative settlement of claims against the United States submitted
by the Active Army, Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve personnel, and civilian employees of DOD and DA for damage
to or loss of personal property incident to their service. (Subpart L). This subpart sets forth procedures to be followed
in the settlement and payment of claims by employees of nonappropriated fund activities for the loss of or damage to
personal property incident to their employment, and for claims generated by the acts or omissions of the employees
of such funds. (Subpart M). This subpart establishes the authority and responsibility for affirmative claims. This
subpart prescribes procedures for the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement, and
waiver of claims in favor of the United States for damage to, loss, or destruction of Army property, and for the recovery
of the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished by the United States under the statutes cited in
section 536.213. (Subpart N). This subpart sets forth procedures for all aspects of records management to include,
arrangement of files, file management, maintenance of and retrieval of files, files disposition, etc., and monthly
claims reporting system as pertains to Claims Office Administration.

qualified claims personnel will be assigned to ensure that claims are promptly investigated and acted upon. With
the concurrence of the service may designate area claims offices within its area of operations to carry out claims
responsibilities within specified geographic areas.

Area claims offices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The area claims office is the principal office for the investigation and adjudication or settlement of claims,
and will be staffed with qualified legal personnel under the supervision of the SJA or command JA or Corps of Engineer
district or command legal counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The full-time responsibility for claims investigations and processing in a portion of the area or for claims related
to the activities of a unit or organization within the area may be delegated to another command, unit, or activity by
the establishment of a claims processing office at the command, unit or authority. (See &sect;536.7 (d)(4) and (e).)
Normally, all claims processing offices will operate under the supervision of the area claims office in whose area
the claims processing office is located. Where a proposed claims processing office is not under the command of the
parent organization of the area claims office, this designation may be effected by a support agreement or memorandum
of understanding between the affected commands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Normally, claims that cannot be settled by an engineer area claims office will be forwarded directly to the Commander,
USARCS with notice to the Chief Counsel, COE of such referral. However, the Chief Counsel, as part of his or her responsibility
for litigation of suits involving civil works and military construction activities, may require that an engineer
area claims office forward claims through engineer channels provided that such requirement does not preclude final
action by Commander, USARCS within the time limitations set forth in subparts D and H.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims processing offices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a chapter 11 claim, if the adjudicated amount of a claim is in excess of the monetary jurisdiction of the head of the
claims processing authority, the claim will be approved and paid up to the delegated authority of that office and immediately
forwarded to the next higher claims authority for additional payment. (See &sect;536.161(e).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims processing offices without approval authority. A claims processing office that has not been granted claims
approval authority will provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned
jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis. Once the investigation is completed, the claims
file will be forwarded to the appropriate area claims office for action. Alternatively, an area claims office may
direct that a claims investigation made by a claims processing office without approval authority be forwarded to
another claims processing office within the area that has approval authority if the claim is within the jurisdiction
of the latter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims processing office with approval authority. A claims processing office that has been granted approval
authority must provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction,
either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis, and for the adjudication and payment of all presented claims
within its monetary jurisdiction. If the estimated value of a claim, after investigation, is beyond the payment authority
of the claims processing office or if disapproval is the appropriate action, the claim file will be forwarded to the
area claims office unless otherwise specified in this regulation, or forwarded to USARCS or the command claims service,
as appropriate, if directed by such service.

(3) Medical claims processing offices. The medical claims JAs at Army medical centers, other than Fitzsimons Army
Medical Center and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, may be designated by the SJA/head of area claims office for the
installation on which the center is located as claims processing offices with approval authority for medical malpractice
claims only. Claims beyond their approval authority will be investigated and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS.
The SJA, Health Services Command, Quality Assurance Division, OTSG (DASG&hyph;PSQ) and the Consultation Case Review
Branch, Clinical Policy and Consultants Division, Office of the Surgeon General (CCRB), will be advised by USARCS
of all referrals, provided a copy of all claims, and informed of their disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Special claims processing offices. (i) The Commander, USARCS, the chief of a command claims service or the head
of an area claims office may designate special claims processing offices within his or her command for specific, short-term
purposes (for example, maneuvers, civil disturbances, and emergencies). These special claims processing offices
may be delegated approval authority necessary to effect the purpose of their creation, but in no case will this delegation
exceed the approval authority maximums set forth in other chapters of this regulation for regular claims processing
offices. All claims will be processed under the claims expenditure allowance and claims command and office code of
the authority who established the office or a code assigned by USARCS. The existence of any special claims processing
office must be reported to the Commander, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A special claims processing office is the proper organization to process and approve, as appropriate, maneuver
damage claims, except where a foreign government is responsible for adjudication under an international agreement
(see subpart G). Personnel from the maneuvering command should be used in the investigation of claims and, at the discretion
of the area claims office, may be assigned to the special claims processing office. Claims filed after the termination
of the maneuver will be processed by the area claims office. Claims arising within the jurisdiction of other area claims
offices, while units are traveling to or from the maneuver, will be investigated by the special claims processing
office and forwarded for action to the area claims office in whose area the claims arose. Claims for damage to real or
personal property arising on private land being used under a permit may be paid from funds specifically budgeted by
the maneuver for such purposes in accordance with AR 405&hyph;15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A special claims processing office provided for a disaster or civil disturbance should include a claims approving
authority with adequate investigatory, administrative, and logistical support, to include damage assessment
and finance and accounting support. It should not be dispatched prior to notification of Commander, USARCS. The concurrence
of Commander, USARCS must be obtained prior to the payment of the first claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Claims processing offices discussed in paragraphs (c) (2) through (4) of this section must be supervised by an
assigned JA or claims attorney in order to exercise delegated approval authority.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Claims investigation and adjudication should be accomplished at the lowest level possible, that is, by the claims
processing office or area claims office with monetary authority over the estimated total value of all claims arising
from the incident in question. The expeditious investigation and settlement of claims is essential to the successful
fulfillment of the Army's responsibilities under the claims statutes implemented by this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where technical errors exist in the filing of a claim or in its format, claimants should be advised of such errors
and the need for corrective action. If the errors concern a jurisdictional matter, advice should be given expeditiously
and a record should be maintained. The advice should include a warning that the error must be corrected prior to the
expiration of the statute of limitations.

Investigative environment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the investigation of claims, every effort should be made to create a cooperative environment engendering the free
exchange of information and evidence. The goal of obtaining sufficient information to make an objective and fair
analysis should be paramount. Personal contact with claimants or their representatives is frequently essential
to clarify the issues both during investigation and prior to adjudication. Where settlement is not feasible, issues
of disagreement or dispute should be clearly identified and spelled out to facilitate the resolution of any reconsideration,
appeal, or in appropriate cases, litigation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commander, USARCS will publish written interpretations of the provisions of this regulation and establish and

If it is considered to be in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS may grant authority to deviate
from the specific requirements contained in this regulation in a particular instance except as to matters that are
based on statutes, treaties and international agreements, executive orders, controlling directives of the Attorney
General or Comptroller General, or otherwise have the force and effect of law.

Conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Government personnel are forbidden to represent any claimant or to receive any payment or gratuity for services rendered.
They may not accept any share or interest in a claim or assist in its presentation, under penalty of Federal criminal
law (18 U.S.C. 203, and 205).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Release of information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Government personnel are prohibited from disclosing information that may be the basis of a claim or any evidence
of record in any claims matter except as authorized by statutory of regulatory authority. Certain documents which
would normally be privileged or exempt from release, such as unclassified statements, documents containing opinions,
conclusions, or findings, may be released to a claimant or his or her attorney, whenever release may help settle a claim
or avoid unnecessary litigation, unless such release is barred by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All requests for records and information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the Privacy
Act (PA) will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in AR 25&hyph;55 or AR 340&hyph;21. Requests
submitted by a claimant or his or her attorney, which cite only the FOIA, will be processed under the time limits of the
FOIA and the exceptions and fees of the PA and FOIA, as required by AR 25&hyph;55, paragraph 1&hyph;512c. Except for
medical quality assurance records exempt from disclosure by 10 U.S.C. records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974,
records within a category for which withholding of the record is discretionary (AR 25&hyph;55, paragraph 3&hyph;101)
may be released to a claimant or his or her attorney, if no legitimate purpose exists for withholding it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When it is determined that exempt information should not be released, the request will be forwarded to USARCS.
For requests processed only under the FOIA, the commander, USARCS, may deny release of the records, acting on behalf
of TJAG, the initial denial authority. The commander, USARCS will forward to TJAG all requests processed under the
FOIA and PA. TJAG is the initial denial authority for PA requests (AR 340&hyph;21, paragraph 1&hyph;7i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims assistance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The foregoing prohibitions do not apply to information and assistance provided in the performance of official duty.
Any person who indicates a desire to file a claim against the United States cognizable under one of the chapters of this
regulation will be instructed concerning the procedure to follow. The claimant will be furnished claim forms and,
when necessary, will be assisted in completing claim forms and assembling evidence. He or she will not be assisted
in determining what amount to claim. In the vicinity of a field exercise, maneuver, or disaster, information may be
disseminated concerning the right to present claims, the procedure to be followed, and the names and location of claims
officers and engineer repair teams. When the government of a foreign country in which U.S. Armed Forces are stationed
has assumed responsibility for the settlement of certain claims against the United States, officials of that country
will be furnished pertinent information and evidence so far as security considerations permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The investigation is performed to ascertain the facts of an incident. Which facts are relevant will often depend
on the law and regulations applicable to the conduct of the parties involved, but as general guidance, the investigation
should develop definitive answers to such questions as ``When,'' ``Where,'' ``Who,'' ``What,'' and ``How.'' Generally,
the time, place, persons, and circumstances involved in an incident may be established by a simple report, but the
cause and the resulting damage may require extensive effort to obtain all the pertinent facts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The object of the investigation is to gather, with the least possible delay, the best available evidence without
accumulating excessive evidence concerning any particular fact. The claimant is often an excellent source of such
information and should be contacted early in the investigation. The investigative file should include medical records,
witness interviews, photographs, and expert opinions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Property other than Government property is damaged, lost, or destroyed. Damage resulting directly or indirectly

(i) A medical or surgical accident; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Care that does not meet standards for non-Government facilities similar to the Army facility providing the care;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An incident that could give rise to a claim against the United States under this regulation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Competent authority so directs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Investigation by a claims officer is required when the situation or consequences described in paragraphs (a)
(1) through (4), and (a)(9) of this section arise from activities of the ARNG or its personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims arising out of situations that may be expected to generate a substantial number of claims in a short period
of time and are properly cognizable for settlement under this regulation (such as maneuvers or other special operations,
emergencies, civil disturbances, aircraft and missile accidents, or disasters) will be investigated in accordance
with procedures set forth herein by the claims office responsible for the area in which the incident occurred. No claim
arising out of such an emergency situation will be paid until the concurrence of the Commander, USARCS has been obtained.
(See &sect;536.8(c)(4)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(d) Where an accident occurs that could only result in a claim against the United States that is not payable because
of the incident to service rule, for example, barred by the Feres Doctrine, or the Federal Employees' Compensation
Act (FECA), or the Longshoremen's and Harborworkers Compensation Act (LHWCA), the investigation may be limited
to that necessary to make such a determination. However, claims officials will ensure that the appropriate commander
or organization safety office is aware of the incident so that measures to avoid a recurrence can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursued.

Unit claims officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Commanders' responsibility. Commanders and heads of DA and DOD components whose personnel, equipment or operations
are involved in an incident giving rise to a potential or actual claim for or against the government (see &sect;536.15(a),
will appoint a commissioned officer, a warrant officer or a qualified civilian employee to conduct an initial factual
investigation of the incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Installation commanders, brigade commanders, commanders of separate battalions, state ARNG Adjutant Generals
and other commanders whose operations may generate a significant number of claims should consider appointing a claims
officer on standing orders to facilitate training and coordination with the claims JA/attorney supporting the unit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Senior noncommissioned officers (E6 thru E9) may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appointed as assistant claims officers to perform duties under the supervision of a claims officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Claims officer appointment orders should designate the claims JA/attorney who supports the unit as the claims
officer's legal advisor. The orders will direct the claims officer to seek guidance from the claims JA/attorney at
the outset of the investigation and before completion of the investigation whenever the potential value of the claim
is in excess of $15,000 or an actual claim in excess of that amount has been filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The scope and duration of the investigation will depend on the severity and complexity of the incident and may range
from merely obtaining investigation reports already prepared by police and other investigators to a formal investigation
by a board of officers under the provisions of chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6. In addition to the provisions of this chapter,
claims officers will follow the guidance in Chapter 5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 and the advice of the claims JA/attorney
listed as their advisor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Unit claims officers, in addition to making a report of investigation as specified in &sect;536.16(c), will account
for and preserve all available evidence for use in future litigation. Evidence will be retained until released by
the claims JA/attorney. Therefore, the claims officer will consult with the claims JA/attorney before disposal,
destruction or repair of damaged property or other evidence. The claims officer will also act as the claims JA/attorney's
point of contact for support and assistance from the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Claims officers must coordinate their work with concurrent criminal and safety investigations, which have priority
within DA for access to accident sites and witnesses (see paragraph 1&hyph;4d, AR 15&hyph;6 and paragraphs 4&hyph;8a(2),
5&hyph;1a(1) and 5&hyph;4 AR 385&hyph;40). To the greatest extent possible claims officers should take advantage
of the work already done on these other investigations (see &sect;536.19 of this part). Although there are limits
on the information safety personnel can release to claims officers, some of the information in safety reports can
be released (see paragraphs 1&hyph;10 and 5&hyph;6, AR 385&hyph;40).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Report of claims officer_(1) Format. The claims officer will prepare a written report of investigation on DA Form
1208 (Report of Claims Officer), except that no recommendation on disposition of prospective claims will be entered
in block 11. Where a formal investigation is conducted in accordance with the procedures in chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6,
the report may be submitted on DA Form 1574 (Report of Proceedings by Investigating Officer/Board of Officers). If
the claims officer does not feel either form is appropriate, the claims JA/attorney advising the claims officer will
be consulted for guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Processing. The report should normally be completed and submitted to the appointing authority within 60 days
of the accident/incident. If a final report will not be completed within that time one or more interim reports may be
required by the commander or claims JA/attorney. The appointing authority will either return the report for further
investigation or, if satisfied that it is as complete as possible given the information available, forward one copy
of the report to the appropriate claims office with or without comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Content. The report will contain findings of fact concerning the incident, to include the circumstances leading
to the incident (e.g. training and experience of Army personnel involved) and the resulting property damage and/or
injuries. These findings should be based on the evidence reasonably available within the time available for completion
of the report. See chapter 5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 for guidance on the information needed in the most common types of claims
incidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Limits on findings. The unit claims officers will not make findings concerning questions of liability or attempt
to assess a dollar value on personal injuries. The findings should merely state the facts (who, what, where, when,
and how). While a clear and complete statement of the facts will often make it clear who is responsible for the damage
or injury, the determination of legal liability and the appropriate amount of compensation is the responsibility
of the claims JA/attorney or the courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use and release of information. The report of this initial investigation may be used in conjunction with any administrative
or legal action within DOD, such as line of duty investigations, reports of surveys, disciplinary actions under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian personnel regulations, contract actions, or the collateral investigation
of an Army accident required by paragraph 1&hyph;7c, AR 385&hyph;40. It may also be used by the commander or the unit's
safety officers as the basis for their safety report (DA Form 285 and 285&hyph;1) when a centralized accident investigation
or separate safety investigation is not conducted. It may be released to the public, to law enforcement personnel,
state and federal regulatory agencies and other non-DOD entities subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information
Act and the Privacy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Disposition of reports. The claims processing office or area claims office having jurisdiction the type of claim
involved will retain the claims officer's report until a claim is received or until six months after the time for filing
a claim is past. If no claim is filed within the statutory limit, the report will be disposed of as an organizational
record in accordance with AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If an incident occurs, or a claim is filed, in a foreign country where no appropriate commander is located, investigative
assistance may be sought from the Defense Attache or the Military Assistance and Advisory Group (MAAG). Incidents
involving Attache or MAAG personnel, and claims arising from their activities, will be investigated in accordance
with DIAM 100&hyph;1B, volume 1, section T, chapter 1, or AR 175, chapter 6, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the provisions of DODD 5515.9 the Commander, USARCS, or designee, may request assistance from DOD components
whose personnel are involved in incidents generating claims in the investigation of such claims, and may appoint
DOD personnel as claims officers for the purpose of conducting such investigations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The claims JA/attorney receiving notice of an incident requiring investigation will immediately refer it to
the appropriate claims officer and will notify, the Commander, USARCS of all major incidents involving serious injury
or death, or where non Federal property damage exceeds $25,000. In some cases the claims JA/attorney assigned to the
case may decide that a unit claims officer investigation is not necessary and waive the requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The heads of area claims offices and the chiefs of command claims services are responsible for ensuring that a prompt
and thorough claims investigation is conducted of all claims for or against the Army arising in their area before they
take or recommend final action on a claim. The investigation of incidents and claims arising out of the activities
of the Corps of Engineers (COE) is the responsibility of the appropriate COE district or division Counsel. On claims
in excess of $25,000, the claims JA/attorney assigned to the case should consult with the action officer at USARCS
on the extent of the investigation (see &sect;536.21). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The initial investigation by the unit claims officer is supposed to be completed promptly after the accident and
may not be sufficient for final resolution of the claim. The unit's investigation will often be completed before a
formal claim is filed and before all information about the full extent of the damages is available. An interview of
the claimant may not have been possible or advisable. New information submitted with the claim may require further
investigation. The more extensive investigation usually required for final action on a claims will often require
the use of not just unit claims officers but also claims JA's/attorneys and investigators within the area claims office,
experts within and from outside DOD and personnel from USARCS.

Transfer of responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Transfer of responsibility is authorized when the investigation may be more practicably conducted or completed
by the claims officer of another installation or unit. When two or more commands are involved, the common superior
commander or the Commander, USARCS will decide who will conduct the investigation. The commanding officer whose
personnel or equipment is involved will furnish to the authority responsible for conducting the investigation all
available information concerning the incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transfer will be accomplished by direct transmittal of a report of the incident in writing, with all available
evidence (or orally, later confirmed in writing). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When more than one Federal agency is or may be involved, the claims office receiving the claim will contact, at the
field level, all other affected agencies in order to obtain the designation of a single agency to investigate and determine
the merits of the claim. If such a designation cannot be agreed upon, USARCS will be notified in order to attempt to resolve
the matter at agency level or to request the Department of Justice to make a designation. If the DA is the designated
agency, the claimant will be notified to correspond only with the DA. This is not to be construed to preclude assistance
in the investigation from other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If a claim is received that arises solely out of the activities of another Federal agency, the claim will be transferred
to such agency and the claimant notified of such transfer. If the appropriate agency cannot be identified, the claim
will be returned to the claimant informing him or her of this fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an incident occurs where the Army has no unit or installation conveniently located for conducting an investigation,
but another U.S. military department does have an installation or unit in the vicinity, the responsible officer may
request the commanding officer or commander of any organization of another U.S. military department to conduct or
assist in the investigation. Similar requests from another military department will be honored if possible.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claims investigator will be guided by policies, procedures, and guidance set forth in DA Pam 27&hyph;162 or furnished
by the Commander, USARCS. For other than routine incidents, guidance should be obtained from the claims approval
or settlement authority who will have jurisdiction based on the probable value of the largest single claim arising
from the incident. The extent and nature of the investigation should be guided by the specific requirement of the situation.
If it is considered in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS, or the chief of a command claims service,
may grant authority to deviate from the specific requirements contained in this regulation in a particular investigation,
except as to procedures that are based on statute or have the force of law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information from other investigations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The investigator should obtain a copy of the report of any prior investigation that was made for purposes other
than claims; for example_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Police reports.

(viii) Investigations by other governmental agencies such as National Transportation Safety Board; Food and Drug
Administration; Center for Disease Control; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; and Consumer Product Safety
Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) While such an investigation may not be adequate for claims and litigation purposes, it may contain evidence and
leads of value to the investigator. If the report of the prior investigation contains diagrams, photographs, or witness
statements, it is not necessary for the investigator to cover the same ground. Copies of such items may be made and included
in the claims investigation. Generally, however, it will be necessary for the investigator to obtain more complete
statements from witnesses. This is especially true for statements in medical quality assurance reports and reports
of Army accidents prepared by Army safety personnel, as there are regulatory restrictions on the use of these statements
in connection with claims and litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When military records fail to confirm the occurrence of a traffic accident upon which a claim is based, or substantial
doubt arises regarding the nature or extent of the actual damages or injuries allegedly sustained, claims authorities
should contact the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of the appropriate State or municipality to ascertain whether an accident
report of the incident is a matter of record and, if so, a copy of such report should be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statements of witnesses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Perhaps the most important phase of an investigation is the securing of statements from available witnesses, including
the claimant and persons associated with him or her, for example, persons riding in the vehicle. The claims investigator
may take the unsworn statements of a witness or may, if the statement is satisfactory for claims purposes, use a statement
secured by another investigator.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Photographs and diagrams. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims investigators should have cameras and obtain photographs and diagrams to describe the scene of incidents
that they investigate. Photographs and drawings should indicate when taken or made and by whom.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims requiring information of a specialized nature. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending on the nature of the incident, the investigator must decide on the specialized nature of evidence that will
be required. In this regard, reference should be made to DA Pam 27&hyph;162 wherein specific items of information
and documentation required for various categories of incidents are listed. Sufficient documentation of property
losses or damages and personal injury or death should be obtained. Technical advice and assistance will be furnished
by other DA agencies such as the Tank and Automotive Command or the Army Safety Center for vehicular accidents, or the
Army Aviation Reserve Board and the Corpus Christi Army Depot for aircraft accidents.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Completion of investigation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon completion of the investigation, the investigator must carefully review the report to ascertain whether all
pertinent information has been included and inconsistencies reconciled. The review should take into consideration
the following questions: Is the report of investigation complete enough to enable the approving authority to decide
how the incident occurred? On whom does the responsibility for the incident rest? What is the extent of any loss or damage
suffered? In the ordinary case, if the investigator has included in the report all information pertaining to the ``what,''
``who,'' ``where,'' ``when,'' and ``how'' of the occurrence, the information needed by those who must decide the
claim will be satisfied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A claim may be presented by the owner of the property, or in the owner's name by a duly authorized agent or legal representative.
As used in this regulation an owner includes the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For real property. The mortgagor, or the mortgagee, if he or she can maintain a cause of action in the local courts
involving a tort to that specific property. When notice of divided interests in real property is received, the claim
should, if feasible, be treated as a single claim or a release from all interests must be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For personal property. A bailee, leasee, mortgagee, and conditional vendor, or others having title for purposes
of security only, are not proper claimants unless specifically authorized in the chapter in question. If more than
one party has an interest in the property, all must join in the claim or a release from all interests must be obtained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured person or by a duly authorized agent or legal representative.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administrator of the deceased's estate, or by any person
determined to be legally or beneficially entitled. The amount allowed will, to the extent practicable, be apportioned
among the beneficiaries in accordance with the law applicable to the incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be presented by any person who by reason of family relationship
has, in fact, incurred the expenses for which the claim is made. For claims cognizable under the provisions of the FTCA,
see subpart D. (See &sect;536.86 for restrictions on damages allowable in claims involving death or personal injury
under the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative will be made in the name of the claimant and signed by the agent
or legal representative showing his or her title or capacity. Where a claim is presented by an agent or legal representative_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Written evidence of the authority of the agent or legal representative to act, such as a power of attorney, is required,

(ii) Where the authority is conferred by State statute, a citation to that statute is required. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
app H, section I, paragraph 14&hyph;2; see also &sect;536.21 for additional requirements relating to settlements.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A claim normally will include all damages that accrue by reason of the incident. Where the same claimant has both
a claim for damage to or loss of property and a claim for personal injury or a claim based on death arising out of the same
incident, each of the foregoing or any combination of them ordinarily represent only an integral part of a single claim
or cause of action. Under subparts C through J of this part, a single claimant is entitled to be compensated only one
time for all damages or injuries arising out of an incident.

Subrogation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim may be presented by the subrogee in his or her own name if authorized by the law of the place where the incident
giving rise to the claim occurred, provided subrogation is not barred by the portion of this regulation applicable
to the type of claim involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claims of the subrogor (insured) and subrogee (insurer) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute
separate claims and it is permissible for the aggregate of such claims to exceed the monetary jurisdiction of the approving
or settlement authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A subrogor and a subrogee may file a claim jointly or individually. A fully subrogated claim will be paid only to
the subrogee. Whether a claim is fully subrogated is a matter to be determined by local law. Some jurisdictions permit
the property owner to file for property damage even though he or she has been compensated for the repairs by his or her
insurer. In such instances a release should be obtained from both parties in interest or be released by both of them.
The approved payment in a joint claim will be by joint check that will be sent to the subrogee unless both parties specify
otherwise. If separate claims are filed, payment will be by check issued to each claimant to the extent of his or her
undisputed interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where a claimant has made an election and accepted workmen's compensation benefits, both statutory and case law
of the jurisdiction should be scrutinized to determine to what extent the claim of the injured party against third
parties has been extinguished by acceptance of compensation benefits. While it is infrequent that the claim is fully
extinguished and where it is not, the only proper party claimant is the workmen's compensation carrier. Even where
the injured party's claim has not been fully extinguished, most jurisdictions provide that the compensation insurance
carrier has a lien on any recovery from the third party and no settlement should be reached without approval by the carrier
where required by local law (19 American Law Reports (ALR) 766, supplemented by 27 ALR 493, 37 ALR 838, 67 ALR 249, 88
ALR 665, and 106 ALR 1040). Also, claims from the workmen's compensation carrier as subrogee or otherwise will not
be considered payable where the United States has paid the premiums, directly or indirectly for the workmen's compensation
insurance. Applicable contract provisions holding the United States harmless should be used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Whether medical payments paid by an insurer to its insured can be subrogated depends on local law. Some jurisdictions
prohibit these claims to be submitted by the insurer notwithstanding a contractual provision providing for subrogation.
Therefore, local law should be researched prior to deciding the issue, and claims forwarded to higher headquarters
for adjudication should contain the results of said research. Such claims, where prohibited by State law, will also
be barred by the Antiassignment Act. (See paragraph (c) of this section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Care will be exercised to require insurance disclosure consistent with the type of incident generating the claim.
Every claimant will, as a part of the claim, make a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage as to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The name and address of every insurer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The kind and amount of insurance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Policy number; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and if so, the amount of such claim; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or has indicated payment will be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Each subrogee must substantiate his or her interest or right to file a claim by appropriate documentary evidence
and should support the claim as to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of any other claimant.
Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does not constitute evidence either of liability of the Government
or of the amount of damages. Approving and settlement authorities will make independent determinations upon the
evidence of record and the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Subrogated claims are not cognizable under subparts E, J or K. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfer and assignments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as they occur by operation of law or after a voucher for the payment has been issued, unless within the exceptions
set forth by statute (31 U.S.C 3727 and AR 37&hyph;107), the following are null and void: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Every purported transfer or assignment of a claim against the United States, or of any part of or interest in a claim,
whether absolute or conditional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Every power of attorney or other purported authority to receive payment of all or part of any such claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The purposes of the Antiassignment Act are to eliminate multiple payment of claims, to cause the United States
to deal only with original parties, and to prevent persons of influence from purchasing claims against the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In general, this statute prohibits voluntary assignments of claims with the exception of transfers or assignments
made by operation of law. The operation of law exception has been held to apply to claims passing to assignees because
of bankruptcy proceedings, assignments for the benefit of creditors, corporate liquidations, consolidations
or reorganizations, and where title passes by operation of law to heirs or legatees. Subrogated claims that arise
under a statute are not barred by the Antiassignment Act. For example, subrogated workmen's compensation claims
are cognizable when presented by the insurer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Subrogated claims that arise pursuant to contractual provisions may be paid to the subrogee if the subrogated
claim is recognized by State statute or decision. For example, an insurer under an automobile insurance policy becomes
subrogated to the rights of a claimant upon payment of a property damage claim. Generally, such subrogated claims
are authorized by State law and are therefore not barred by the Antiassignment Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Before claims are paid, it is necessary to determine whether there may be a valid subrogated claim under Federal
or State statute or subrogation contract held valid by State law. If there may be a valid subrogated claim forthcoming,
payment should be withheld for this portion of the claim. If it is determined that claimant is the only proper party,
full settlement is authorized.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action by claimant
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) Form of claim. (i) The claimant will submit his or her claim using authorized official forms whenever practicable.
A claim is filed only when the vital elements (see Appendix B to this part) have been supplied in writing by a person authorized
to present a claim (paragraph (a) of this section) unless the claim is cognizable under a chapter that specifies otherwise.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A claim may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's
option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Signatures. (i) The claim and all other papers should be signed in ink by the claimant or his or her duly authorized
agent. Such signatures will include the first name, middle initial, and surname. A married woman should sign her claim
in her given name; for example, ``Mary A. Doe.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the claimant is represented, the supporting evidence required by paragraph (a)(5) will be required only
if the claim is signed by the agent or legal representative. However, in all cases in which a claimant is represented,
the name and address of the representative will be included in the file together with copies of all correspondence
and records of conversations and other contacts maintained and included in the file. Frequently, these records are
determinative as to whether the statute of limitations has been tolled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Presentation. The claim be presented to the commanding officer of the unit involved; the legal office of the nearest
Army post, camp, or station; or other military establishment convenient to the claimant. In a foreign country where
no appropriate commander is stationed, the claim may be submitted to any attache of the U.S. Armed Forces. (See AR 1&hyph;75.)
Claims arising overseas which are cognizable under Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Status of Forces of
Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America
and Japan Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Japan or other similar treaty
or agreement are filed with designated claims officials of the receiving State.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each statute available to the DA for the administrative settlement of claims, except the Maritime Claims Settlement
Act (10 U.S.C. 4802), specifies the time during which the right to file a claim must be exercised. These statutes of
limitations, which are jurisdictional in nature, are not subject to waiver unless the statute expressly provides
for waiver. Specific information concerning the period for filing under each statute is contained in the appropriate
implementing chapter of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
When a claim accrues
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A claim accrues on the date on which the alleged wrongful act or omission results in an actionable injury or damage
to the claimant or his or her decedent. Exceptions to this general rule may exist where the claimant does not know of
the injury or damage, or does not know the cause of injury or damage. In those cases, the claim accrues when the injured
party, or someone acting on his or her behalf, knows or should know about both the existence and cause of the injury.
However, this exception does not apply when, at a later time, he or she discovers that the acts inflicting the injury
may constitute medical malpractice. (See United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 100 S. Ct. 352 (1979).) The discovery
rule is not limited to medical malpractice claims; it has been applied to diverse situations involving violent death,
chemical and atomic testing, and erosion and hazardous work environment. In claims for indemnity or contribution
against the United States, the accrual date is the time of payment for which indemnity is sought or on which contribution
is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of infancy, incompetency, or the filing of suit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute of limitations for administrative claims is not tolled by infancy or incompetency. Likewise, the statute
of limitations is not tolled for purposes of filing an administrative claim by filing of a suit based upon the same incident
in a Federal, State, or local court against the United States or other parties. (For the effect of filing an administrative
claim with an agency other than the Army, see &sect;536.53(b), &sect;536.77 (b) and (c) and &sect;536.102) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amendment of claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A claim may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's
option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). A claim may be amended by changing the amount, the bases of liability, or elements of
damages concerning the same incident. Parties may be added only if the additional party could have filed a joint claim
initially as in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the additional party had a separate cause of action, his or her
claim may not be treated as an amendment but only as a separate claim and is thus barred if the statute of limitations
has run. For example, if a claim is timely filed on behalf of a minor for personal injuries, a subsequent claim by a parent
for loss of services is considered a separate claim and is barred if it is not filed prior to the running of the statute
of limitations. Another example is where a separate claim is filed for loss of services or consortium by a spouse arising
out of injuries to the husband or wife of the claimant. On the other hand, if a claim is timely filed by an insured for the
deductible portion of his or her property damage, a subsequent claim by the insurer based on payment of property damage
to its insured may be filed as an amendment even though the statute of limitations has run, unless final action has been
taken on the insured's claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Date of receipt stops the running of the statute.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In computing the time to determine whether the period of limitation has expired, exclude the first day and include
the last day, except when it falls on a nonworkday such as Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which case it is to
be extended to the next workday.

(1) If the claim is of a type and amount within the jurisdiction of the claims office of the command concerned and the
claim is meritorious in the amount claimed, it will be approved and paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claim in an amount in excess of the monetary jurisdiction of the claims office is meritorious in a lesser amount
within its jurisdiction, the claim may be approved for payment provided the amount offered is accepted by the claimant
in settlement of the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the claim is not of a type within the jurisdiction of the claims office, or if the claimant will not accept an amount
within its jurisdiction, the claim with supporting papers and a recommendation for appropriate action will be forwarded
to the next higher claims authority. Any personnel claim forwarded to a higher authority for settlement will be accompanied
by a memorandum of opinion. Prior to forwarding any tort claim, the USARCS AAO must be consulted and a joint decision
reached on whether a memorandum of opinion must be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the claim is determined to be not meritorious, it will be disapproved provided the claims office has settlement
authority for claims of the type and amount involved. If the type and amount of the claim requires denial by a higher
authority, the claim will be forwarded through claims channels to the appropriate authority accompanied by a claims
memorandum of opinion recommending denial. Prior to the disapproval of a claim under a particular statute, a careful
review should be made to ensure that the claim is not properly payable under a different statute or on another basis.

Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On all dental and medical malpractice claims, claims JAs will attach DD Form 2526 (Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims)
to all memoranda prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, and forward to USARCS. Claims JAs will also submit this
form to USARCS on all dental and medical malpractice claims settled or denied within their local authority. When a
claim is transferred to USARCS without a forwarding memorandum prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, DD Form
2526 must still be completed and forwarded within 60 days after the medical records are available for review by the
MTF/DTF risk manager (RM). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims JAs/MCJAs will coordinate the completion of the form pertaining to the Standard of Care, Diagnoses, and
Procedures with the MTF/DTF RM or the RM's designee. If the RM does not provide this information, claims JAs/MCJAs
will note the reason and submit the form to USARCS. The sections pertaining to Provider Information and Type of Provider
and Specialty of DD Form 2526 will not be completed on the form submitted to USARCS. OTSG will task subordinate commands
to forward provider information on settled claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims JAs are required to submit one DD Form 2526 for each incident (course of treatment or nontreatment that results
in an injury) for which a claim has been filed. Derivative claims do not require a separate report. However, separate
reports are required when claimants allege physical injury to more than one claimant (for example, an infant's claim
for brain damage as a result of birth trauma and a mother's claim for physical injury caused by the delivery would require
two reports). When a claimant alleges negligent medical care at more than one MTF/DTF, USARCS will designate the claims
JA who will complete the DD Form 2526.

Subsequent action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not necessary for each claims authority who considers the claim to write a separate memorandum. If a claims approval
or settlement authority agrees with the memorandum of opinion written by another authority, he or she can adopt the
earlier memorandum by merely stating that he or she concurs in the adopted memorandum and stating the nature of the
action. If there is disagreement, in whole or in part, with the earlier memorandum, such disagreement should be stated
and reasons therefor set forth in a separate memorandum or in an addendum. The approval or settlement authority will
personally sign the action, indicating position title.

Actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following actions may be taken as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Transmittal of the claim to the appropriate claims office for proposed disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Disapproval of the claim provided the person signing the action is a settlement authority. (See appendix B to this
part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Final offer. (See appendix B to this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Approval and certification of the claim for payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF 1034 (Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal) will be used on all claims settled under
this regulation except claims settled under subpart D which will be paid utilizing an SF 1145 (Voucher for Payment
Under the Federal Tort Claims Act). (See &sect;536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When an SF 1034 is to be paid by the GAO, the certification block of the SF 1034 will not be signed by Army Officials.
GAO officials will certify any payment made by that agency. (See &sect;536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Payment of a claim under subpart D in excess of $2,500 is obtained by forwarding necessary documentation to the
GAO. Complete information on the requirements to effect such payments are set forth in &sect;536.35(b). Note that
the approval or settlement authority signs only the approval block (lower left) of the SF 1145 before submitting a
claim to the GAO for payment.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Liability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the adjudication of tort claims arising in the United States, the liability of the United States generally is determined
in accordance with the law of the state or country where the act or omission occurred, except that any conflict between
local law and an applicable United States statute will be resolved in favor of the latter. However, in claims arising
in foreign countries, liability may be based in whole or in part on local law or as otherwise provided in subpart C for
settlements of claims of United States inhabitants arising overseas under the Military Claims Act. (See &sect;536.55(c).
Where liability is not clear or other issues exist, settlements should truly reflect the uncertainties in the adjudication
of such issues. Compromise settlements are encouraged provided agreement can be reached that reflects the reduced
value of the damages as measured against the full value or range of value if such uncertainties or issues did not exist
and were it possible for the claimant to successfully litigate the claim.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Quantum exclusion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs of filing a claim and similar costs (for example, court costs, bail, interest, inconvenience expenses,
or costs of long distance telephone calls or transportation in connection with the preparation of a claim) are not
proper quantum elements and will not be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Property damage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Property damage compensable under the tort claims provisions of this regulation means damage to tangible real or
personal property (see glossary). It does not include mere diminution of value of real property unless there is some
corresponding physical damage to the property, nor does it include damage to reputation, employment rights or constitutional
rights. Other remedies may be available for such injuries but they are generally not cognizable under the FTCA, MCA,
FCA or the Maritime Claims Settlement Act.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim for personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States or a civilian employee of the
United States that accrued incident to his or her service is not payable under this regulation. A property damage claim
that accrued incident to the service of a member of the Armed Forces may be payable under 31 U.S.C. 3721 (subpart K) or
the MCA (subpart C), depending on the facts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Property damage claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim for damage to or loss of personal property of a claimant who is within one of the categories of proper party claimants
listed in &sect;536.163, which is otherwise cognizable under &sect;536.164, must first be considered thereunder.
If a claim is not clearly compensable under subpart K, and it arises incident to a noncombat activity of the DA or was
caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission of military personnel or civilian employees of DOD, it may be cognizable
under either the MCA or the FTCA. The claim, if meritorious in fact, will probably be payable under one authorization
or another regardless of whether the claim accrued incident to the service of the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Personal injury and death claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Only after the death or personal injury has been determined to have not been incurred incident to the member's service
should subparts C and D be studied to determine which, if either, provides a proper basis for settlement of the claim.
In any event, the rule in U.S. v. Brooks, 176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1949) requiring setoff of amounts obtained though military
or veterans' compensation systems against amounts otherwise recoverable will be followed. Other Government benefits
funded by general Treasury revenues, not by the claimant's contributions, may also be used as a setoff against the
settlement, for example,

United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
619 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir. 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As the incident to service issue is determinative as to whether this type of claim may be processed administratively,
the applicable law and facts should be carefully considered before deciding that injury or death was not incident
to service. Such claims also are often difficult to settle on the issue of quantum and thus more likely to end in litigation.
Moreover, the United States may well elect to defend the lawsuit on the basis of the incident to service exclusion and
this defense could be prejudiced by a contrary administrative determination that a service member's personal injuries
or death were not incident to service. Doubtful cases will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS without action along
with sufficient factual information to permit a determination of the incident to service question.

Property damage appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Appraisers will be used as follows: (1) Appraisers should be used in all claims where an appraisal is reasonably
necessary and useful in effectuating the administrative settlement of the claim. Appraisals may not be economically
feasible in some cases involving property damage of less than $100 per item and the extent of damage may be determined
by personal inspection and agreement with the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where an appraisal is considered necessary, the claims officer and claimant should mutually agree, whenever
possible, upon a disinterested appraiser after determining the approximate cost of the appraisal. The method of
payment should be agreed upon in advance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the claimant pays for the appraisal and can substantiate payment thereof by a paid bill or cancelled check, such
cost is a reimbursable element of damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the DA is absorbing the cost of the appraisal, payment is made from Appropriations, Operation and Maintenance,
Army (AR 37&hyph;108, paragraph 3&hyph;74). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a single appraiser cannot be agreed upon, a joint appraisal can be conducted (that is one in which an appraiser
chosen by claimant and an appraiser chosen by the Government both examine the property and submit their respective
appraisals). Joint appraisals should be coordinated and monitored by the claims officer. The cost of a single or joint
appraisal should be commensurate with the amount of damage allegedly sustained and the fee charged by other appraisers
for similar work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Appraisals by other organizations within the DA, the other Armed Services, or other Federal agencies may be used
in addition to or in lieu of independent appraisal when obtainable. Other organizations within DA may be called upon
to furnish such appraisals; for example, engineer districts will furnish an appraiser, if available, in regard to
damage to buildings or diminution in value of real property, provided the requesting office defrays travel expenses
for the individual's TDY.

Independent medical examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In claims involving serious personal injuries, for example, cases in which there is an allegation of temporary
or permanent disability, the claimant should be examined by an independent physician, or other medical specialist,
depending upon the nature and extent of the injuries. The necessity for, and the cost of, the examination should be
commensurate with the severity of the injuries allegedly sustained and the fee charged by other examiners for similar
work. To preclude duplication of effort and expense, both claimant and the claims officer must agree, in advance,
upon the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The examiner chosen to conduct the examination and the location of the medical facility (whether governmental
or civilian). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the examiner's report constitutes the best evidence of the nature and extent of claimant's injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The method of paying for the examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The necessity for conducting the medical examination must be approved by the claims office having monetary jurisdiction
over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident. If a medical report is submitted in conjunction
with the filing of a claim, such report should be included in the file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment of a civilian examiner's fee can be accomplished in either of the following two ways:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The claimant can incur the cost of the examination and submit a paid receipt or cancelled check, which constitutes
a reimbursable element of damage in evaluating the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The DA can absorb the cost of the examination (payment is made from Appropriations, Operation and Maintenance,
Army (AR 37&hyph;108, paragraph 3&hyph;74)) by the claims office having responsibility for investigating the claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As to an examination costing in excess of $750 or when local funds are exhausted, a request for funding may be directed
to Commander, USARCS with appropriate justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the parties cannot agree upon an independent examiner, and if either the examiner chosen by the claimant or the
results of the examination are not acceptable, the Government may demand that the claimant be examined by an examiner
acceptable to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Examinations of claimants at Army medical treatment facilities are authorized by AR 40&hyph;3. Such examinations
may be used in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing where indicated.

The total award to which the claimant (and subrogees) may be entitled normally will be computed as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Determine the total of the loss or damage suffered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Deduct from the total loss or damage suffered any payment, compensation, or benefit the claimant has received
from the following sources: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The U.S. or ARNG employee/member who caused the damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The U.S. or ARNG employee's/member's insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any person or agency in a surety relationship with the U.S. employee; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any joint tortfeasor or insurer, to include Government contractors under contracts or in jurisdictions where
it is permissible to obtain contribution or indemnity from the contractor in settlement of claims by contractor employees
and third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any advance payment made pursuant to the section entitled ``advance payments'' of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Any benefit or compensation based directly or indirectly on an employer-employee relationship with the United
States or Government contractor and received at the expense of the United States, including but not limited to medical
or hospital services, burial expenses, death gratuities, disability payment, or pensions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The State (Commonwealth and so forth) whose employee or ARNG member (32 U.S.C. section 101(3) caused or generated
an incident that was a proximate cause of the resulting damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Value of Federal medical care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Benefits paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that are intended to compensate the same elements of damage.
When the claimant is receiving money benefits from the VA under 38 U.S.C. 351 for a nonservice connected disability
or death based on the injury that is the subject of the claim, acceptance of a settlement or an award under the FTCA will
discontinue the VA monetary benefits until the amount that would have otherwise been received in VA monetary benefits
is equal to the total amount of the agreement or award including attorney fees. While monetary benefits received under
38 U.S.C. 351 must be discontinued as above, medical benefits, that is, VA medical care may continue provided the settlement
or award expressly provides for such continuance and the appropriate VA official is informed of such continuance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) When the claimant is receiving money benefits under 38 U.S.C. 410b for non-service connected death, arising
from the injury that is the subject of the claim, acceptance of a settlement or award under the FTCA or under any other
tort procedure will discontinue the VA benefits until the amount that would have otherwise been received in VA benefits
is equal to the amount of the total settlement or award including attorney fees. The discontinuation of monetary benefits
under 38 U.S.C. 410b has no effect on the receipt of other VA benefits. The claimant should be informed of the foregoing
prior to the conclusion of any settlement and thus afforded an opportunity to make appropriate adjustment in the amount
being negotiated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The value of other Federal benefits to which the claimant did not contribute, or at least to the extent they are
funded from general revenue appropriations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) From collateral sources where permitted by State law (for example, State or Federal workers' compensation,
social security, private health, accident, and disability benefits paid as a result of injuries caused by a health
care provider). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No deduction will be made for any payment the claimant has received by way of voluntary contributions, such as donations
of charitable organizations.

(d) Where a payment has been made to the claimant by his or her insurers or other subrogee, or under workmen's compensation
insurance coverage if subrogated interests are allowable, the award based on total damages will be apportioned in
relation to their separate interests (&sect;536.20). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) After deduction of permissible collateral and noncollateral sources, also deduct that portion of the loss or
damage believed to have been caused by the negligence of the claimant, third parties whose negligence can be imputed
to the claimant, or joint tortfeasors who are liable for their share of the negligence (for example, where some form
of the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act has been passed).

Claims with more than one potential source of recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Government seeks to avoid multiple recovery (that is, claimants seeking recovery from more than one potential
source) and to minimize the award it must make. The claims investigation should therefore identify other parties
potentially liable to the claimant and/or their insurance carriers; indicate the status of any claims made or include
a statement that none has been made so that it can be assured there is only one recovery and the Government does not pay
a disproportionate share. Where no claim has been made by the claimant against others potentially liable, if applicable
State law grants the Government the right to indemnity or contribution, and it is felt the Government may be entitled
to either under the facts developed by the claims investigation, the claims officer or attorney should formally notify
the other parties of their potential liability, the Government's willingness to share information, and its expectation
of shared responsibility for any settlement. Furthermore, the claimant may be receiving or entitled to receive benefits
from collateral and non-collateral sources (&sect;536.28), which can be deducted from the total loss or damage.
Accordingly, a careful review must be made of applicable State laws regarding joint and several liability, indemnity,
contribution, comparative negligence, and the collateral source doctrine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a demand by a claimant or an inquiry by a potential claimant is directed solely to the Army, where it appears that
the responsible Army employee may have applicable insurance coverage, the employee should be queried as to whether
he or she has liability insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If so, determine if his or her insurer has made or will make any payment to claimant. Under applicable State laws,
the United States may also be an insured entitled to coverage under the employee's liability policy. (See 16 ALR3d
1411; United States v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., 245 F. Supp. 58 (D. Ore. 1965.)) Therefore, where there may be applicable
insurance coverage, the policy language should be reviewed, together with the rules and regulations of the State
insurance regulatory body, or determine whether_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The United States comes within the definition of ``insured''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The exclusion of the United States from policy coverage conforms with state laws and policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Appropriate consideration has been given for a policy where the United States has been excluded from coverage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the employee refuses to cooperate in providing this information, he or she should be advised to comply with the
notice requirements of the insurance policy and to request the insurance carrier to contact the claims officer or
attorney. The case should be followed to ascertain whether the employee's insurer has made or will make any payment
to the claimant before deciding whether to settle the claim against the Government. Normally, the award, if any, to
the claimant will be reduced by the amount of the payment of the employee's insurance carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the employee is the sole target of the claim and Army claims authorities arrange to have the claim made against
the Government, the employee should be required to notify his or her insurance carrier according to the policy and
inform Army claims authorities of the name of the insurance carrier and details of the coverage. Except when the driver's
statute is applicable, the insurance carrier is expected to participate in the negotiation of the claims settlement
and to pay its fair share of any award to the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Where the responsible Army employee is ``on loan'' to another employer other than the United States (for example,
an ROTC instructor at a civilian institution or performing duties for a foreign government), it should be determined
whether there is applicable statutory or insurance coverage concerning the acts of the responsible employee and
appropriate contribution or indemnification should be sought. In the case of foreign governments, applicable treaties
or agreements are controlling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A great many claims cognizable under the FTCA are now settled on a compromise basis. A major consideration in many
such settlements is the identification of other sources of recovery. This is true in a variety of factual situations
where there is a potential joint tortfeasor; for example, multi-vehicle accidents with multiple drivers and guest
passengers, State or local government involvement, contractors performing non-routine tasks for the Government,
medical treatment rendered to claimants by non-Government employees, or incidents caused by a member or employee
of the military department of a State or Commonwealth with whom the DA does not have a cost-sharing agreement. The law
of the jurisdiction regarding joint and several liability, indemnity, and contribution may permit shared financial
responsibility, but even in jurisdictions that do not permit contribution, a compromise settlement can be reached
with the other tortfeasor's insurance company paying a portion of the total amount of the claim against the Government.
For these reasons, every effort should be made to identify the insurance of all potential tortfeasers involved and
the status of any claims made, and to demand contribution or indemnity where substantial reason exists to believe
that liability for the loss or damage should be shared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When a claim is filed against the Government under a chapter that does not permit the payment of a subrogated interest
(subparts E, J, K), it is important to ensure that full information is obtained from the claimant regarding insurance
coverage since it is the legislative intent of the statutes upon which these chapters are based that insurance coverage
be fully utilized before using appropriated funds to pay the claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Settlement means denial or payment of a claim in full or in part. When an approval or settlement authority determines
that a claim is meritorious in an amount within his or her monetary jurisdiction, the claim will be approved in that
amount under the statute determined to be proper regardless of the statutory basis asserted by the claimant. Every
effort will be made to settle claims at the lowest level possible commensurate with the actual value of the claim.

If an approval or settlement authority approves a claim in full, the claim will be certified for payment to the appropriate

(3) If an approval authority, inform the claimant that if he or she does not desire to accept the award, he or she should
indicate in the reply the reasons for rejection. If a settlement authority, and the action is taken under subparts
C or F, inform the claimant of the right to appeal. (See &sect;536.63 and &sect;536.103.) DA Pam 27&hyph;162 provides
sample formats for letters notifying claimants of the actions taken on their claims. (Figure 5&hyph;10 is to be used
by field approving and settlement authorities; figures 5&hyph;8 through 5&hyph;11 are to be used by claims authorities
in conjunction with &sect;536.37 of this part.)

 When a claimant rejects a partial award, the approval authority may reconsider the matter and, if justified, make
further efforts to settle the claim. When further efforts to settle appear unwarranted, the claim and related file
will be forwarded to the settlement authority having jurisdiction over the largest claim or potential claim arising
out of the incident with a memorandum of opinion. The claimant should be advised of such referral.

Civil works claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Engineer civil works claims settled under the provisions of the FTCA in an amount of $2,500 or less normally are paid
out of funds controlled by the COE rather than claims appropriations. Unsettled claims in this category should, therefore,
be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. An information copy will be sent to the COE, ATTN: Chief Counsel, unless the
latter waives that requirement. Civil works claims received outside engineer channels should be forwarded without
further action to the district or division engineer in whose area the incident occurred, or to the COE, ATTN: Chief
Counsel.

Settlement of property damage claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All claims submitted for only property damage or for only personal injury should be evaluated for other potential
claims. Under tort claims statutes, only one payment may be made to a claimant on all claims arising out of a single incident.
Therefore, a property damage claim arising from an incident in which the claimant sustained injury should not be paid
unless the claimant executes a release for any potential injury claim. Likewise, when a property damage claim is settled
the claimant should be informed that subsequent claims for hidden damage or loss of use are precluded by the settlement.

 If the chief of a command claims service or the head of a claims office considers a claim meritorious in an amount exceeding

over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident. The claimant should be informed of this referral.
In most cases the claimant should not be informed of the amount of award recommended. However, for claims arising under
the Foreign Claims Act notice of the amount recommended may be required in accordance with &sect;536.156.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Companion claim.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When two or more claims arising from the same incident are by reason of differences in amounts within the monetary jurisdiction
of different approval or settlement authorities, all such claims will be forwarded to the authority having jurisdiction
over the claim presented in the greatest amount. This authority may either settle the claims or return the claim to
the appropriate field claims office for settlement in accordance with his or her guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The same procedure will be followed when a potential claim exists in an amount estimated to be beyond the jurisdiction
of the approval or settlement authority actually considering the matter. For example, the foregoing applies when
a small subrogated property damage claim is received arising from an incident in which severe personal injury or death
has occurred but to which no claim has yet been filed. In a case of clear liability, authorization to settle the claim
within the monetary jurisdiction of the requesting officer may be obtained telephonically or by other expeditious
means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Similarly, where there is a claim for property damage and no evidence (for example, police report, report of survey,
collateral accident investigation, and witness interviews) of personal injury, the property damage claim may be
settled by the authority having jurisdiction. However, where there is evidence of personal injury, the foregoing
caveat regarding settlement and payment of lesser claims will apply. In such instances the claimant will be informed
that settlement of a property damage claim will preclude settlement of a subsequently filed personal injury claim
and vice versa. (See &sect;536.176 on personnel claims and &sect;537.32 on companion claims in litigation.)

Property claim of a claims authority or superior.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A claim arising from loss or damage to the property of an approval or settlement authority or his or her superior officer
in the chain of command will be forwarded without recommendation to the next higher settlement authority (in the case
of a division, this would be a corps level settlement authority; in an overseas area, this includes a command claims
service) or to USARCS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except under subpart K, if a claim is determined to be meritorious in an amount less than claimed, or if a claim involving
personal injuries or death is approved in full, a settlement agreement will be obtained prior to payment. A settlement
agreement may be required in other instances when, in the opinion of the adjudicating authority, good legal practice
so dictates; for example, where family or other multiple interests may be involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A DA Form 1666 may be used for settlement of claims under the FTCA for less than $2,500 and for all other claims payable
from Army funds. Claims payable in excess of $2500 under the FTCA will be settled using Standard Form 1145, Voucher
for Payment Under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In some cases a special settlement agreement may be necessary to reflect
the full understanding of the parties. However, all such special agreements should incorporate the language of the
acceptance block on the Standard Form 1145. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Acceptance by a claimant of an award under subparts C and K constitutes a full and final settlement and release of
any and all claims against the United States and against the military or civilian personnel whose act or omission gave
rise to the claim. The claimant should be so advised prior to the initiation of negotiations. Where this is done orally
and the claimant is unrepresented, a memorandum of the conversation should be placed in the file and a copy furnished
to the claimant. Also, settlement negotiations with unrepresented claimants should also be preserved in the form
of memoranda retained in the file with a copy furnished to the claimant. While a settlement agreement is not required
in claims adjudicated under subpart K, the settlement authority approving payment may require one at his or her discretion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims involving minors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Generally, only a court-appointed guardian of the estate of a minor, or a person performing a similar function
under the supervision of a court, can execute a binding settlement agreement relative to a minor's claim. Therefore,
a guardian of the estate of the minor or similar functionary must be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction
and must execute a settlement agreement before a claim is approved and paid. (See &sect;536.35.) However, this requirement
can be eliminated and the settlement agreement can be signed by a parent, next-of-kin, or a friend if the contemplated
payment is small and the cost of obtaining a court-appointed guardian would materially deplete the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In foreign countries where the amount agreed to does not exceed $2,500.00, the requirement for obtaining a guardian
may be eliminated. However, in areas where the FTCA (subpart D) applies, local law should be consulted as a basis for
determining whether a court appointed guardian should be required. The requirement to appoint a guardian should
not be imposed until a particular claim is determined to be meritorious in an amount that would require the appointment
of a guardian. The claimant should be advised of this requirement well in advance of settlement negotiations so that
the cost of establishing guardianship can be considered by the claimant as a factor in evaluating the claim. This requirement
also can be eliminated if local law authorizes or requires a claim such as for the death of a parent of the minor, to be
presented on behalf of the estate of the decedent by an administrator, administratrix, or the like. In such cases,
a settlement agreement signed by the administrator, administratrix, or the like will suffice if, under local law,
such action is binding on the minor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims involving incompetents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above stated principles may also be applied in appropriate cases involving incompetents. Authority to waive

requirements are materially impeding settlement of the claim, the matter should be brought to the attention of the
Commander, USARCS for appropriate resolution.

The settlement of a claim involving a claimant who has elected to receive workmen's compensation benefits under local

Vouchers are prepared in an original and three copies. The original and two copies (one marked as comeback copy) will

office will return the comeback copy, which will be included in the file when it is transmitted to the Commander, USARCS

Accounting codes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Certifying an approved claim for payment creates an obligation against the claims appropriation for the fiscal
year then in progress. Accordingly, the voucher will bear the appropriate accounting code for both the appropriation
charged and the current fiscal year, irrespective of the date the claim accrued or was filed. Confusion sometimes
arises at the end of a fiscal year; for example, an approved claim is certified for payment on 28 September (the last
business day of a fiscal year), but it is obvious that it will not be actually paid (i.e., a check issued by the disbursing
activity) until on or after 1 October (the first day of the following fiscal year). At the time the check is issued, the
accounting code will not be advanced to the next fiscal year. Claims checks are issued using the accounting code of
the fiscal year in which the claim was certified for payment (i.e., the fiscal year in which the voucher was signed).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The accounting code for each type of claim remains constant, except for the third digit of the code which is the second
digit of the fiscal year (e.g., ``0'' for ``FY 90''). The accounting codes for claims appropriations are published
each fiscal year in the AR 37&hyph;100 series. Accounting codes used in the payment of claims and refunds, and their
references, are listed below; the ``X'' denotes the space where the second digit of the fiscal year appears.

Except as provided in &sect;536.35(a)(1), when a claim has been determined to be payable, the approval or settlement
authority will transmit the following to the appropriate disbursing office: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The voucher (SF 1034 or SF 1145 as appropriate) in triplicate, with a request that one copy be returned with voucher
number and date of payment noted thereon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Two copies of_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The claim. (Under subpart K this means DD Form 1842 (Claim for Loss of or Damage to Personal Property Incident to
Service).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The settlement agreement, as required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Actions and other documents as required; for example, DA Form 1668 signed by the approving or settlement authority
(as the substitute for action in small claims under subparts C, D, E, F, H or J) attorney general approval and court approval
on claims for minors and incompetents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Original power of attorney, where appropriate.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Electronic payment procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At installations where electronic payment procedures have been implemented, the approving or settlement authority
will electronically transmit payment information to the servicing finance and accounting office. The claim, the
settlement agreement, any actions or other required documents, and the original power of attorney will not be transmitted
to the finance and accounting office, but will be retained in the claims file. Instead, a ``payment report'' produced
by the claims automation program provided such offices by USARCS, which evidences or supports the fact that a claims
official has approved a claim payment, will be transmitted to the disbursing activity in accordance with locally
established procedures. The method of transmission used should not result in avoidable or significant delay in the
issuance of checks for claims payments. The payment report includes_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The name of the payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The payee's social security number (if available).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The payee's address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The date the claim was filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The claim number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The amount claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The amount of the approved payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The date the payment was recorded in claims records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The claims office identification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The claims office's office code.

Payments in excess of $2,500 under the FTCA (&sect;536.78).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Claims paid in excess of $2,500 under the FTCA will be submitted to the GAO with the same documentation as indicated
in (a) above but with the following exceptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Standard Form 1145 will be signed by the settlement authority on the lower left side only. The space on the right
side for the authorized certifying officer will not be signed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where a minor is payee, the full legal name of the individual should be listed on the voucher; for example, ``John
Doe, Sr., as guardian of John Doe, Jr.'' Descriptive words such as ``Mrs. John Doe and her three minor children'' should
not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The accounting classification will not be placed on the voucher. This is accomplished by the GAO as the payment
is made from Treasury funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The letter of transmittal to the GAO will include a statement that the individual whose signature appears on the
voucher as certifying authority is the person having authority to act under the provisions of the FTCA and &sect;536.80.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Attorney General will approve payments in excess of $25,000 in lieu of action of the approval or settlement
authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance payment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When it has been determined that an advance payment will be made, the approval or settlement authority will transmit
to the appropriate disbursing officer_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF 1034 (in triplicate) with a request that one copy be returned with voucher number and date of payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The original copy and one copy of the action by the approval or settlement authority authorizing advance payment
and the Advance Payment Acceptance Agreement. (See &sect;536.47)

Payment involving minors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lost, stolen, forged, destroyed, or undeliverable Government checks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Army disbursing officers have the authority to issue substitute checks for checks that have been issued by the Army
and that are subsequently lost, destroyed, or rendered undeliverable. (See AR 37103, chap. 4, secs. VII through X.)
Some Federal agencies do not yet have this authority. Inquiries from payee or endorsees of Army-issued checks should
be referred to an Army comptroller; inquiries regarding other agencies should be referred to the specific agency
involved. For claims paid by the GAO, if the Treasury check is lost or stolen, the payee or endorsee should be referred
to the Check Forgery Insurance Fund, Department of the Treasury (31 U.S.C 3343, 31 CFR 235.1 through 235.6). The Fund
can reimburse such losses provided the specific requirements of the Statute are met. The Fund is administered by the
Commissioner, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, 3700 East-West Highway, Hyattsville,
MD 20782.

Effect of payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Acceptance of an award by the claimant, except for advance payment, constitutes for the United States, military personnel,
or civilian employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, a release from all liability to the claimant, based
on the act or omission. However, on tort claims only one payment may be made for all damages a claimant sustains from
an incident. Therefore, a signed unconditional settlement agreement is needed to ensure that the claimant understands
the finality of accepting payment.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The nature and extent of the written notification to the claimant as to the denial of his or her claim should be based
on whether the claimant has a judicial remedy following denial or an administrative recourse to appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final actions under subpart D.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the settlement authority has information that could be a persuasive factor for the claimant as to whether to resort
to litigation, such information may be orally transmitted to the claimant and, in appropriate cases, released under
normal procedures in accordance with AR 340&hyph;17 or AR 340&hyph;21. However, the written notification of the
denial should be general in nature; for example, denial on the weaker ground of contributory negligence should be
avoided and the inclination should be to deny on the basis that the claimant was solely responsible for the incident.
The claimant will be informed in writing of his or her right to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District Court
not later than 6 months after the date of mailing of the notification. See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, figures 5&hyph;8 and
5&hyph;9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final actions under subparts C, F and J.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Final agency actions under subparts C, F or J are subject to appeal and the claimant will be so informed. Also, the notice
of final action will be sufficiently detailed to provide the claimant with an opportunity to know and attempt to overcome
the basis for denial. The claimant should not be afforded a valid basis for claiming surprise when an issue adverse
to him or her is asserted as a basis for denying the appeal (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, figs 5&hyph;8 and 5&hyph;9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Denials on jurisdictional grounds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regardless of the nature of the claim or the statute under which it may be considered, claims denied on jurisdictional
grounds that are valid, certain, and not easily overcome (and for this reason no detailed investigation as to the merits
of the claim is conducted) should contain in the denial letter a statement that the denial on such grounds is not to be
construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the claim or an admission of liability. If sufficient factual
information is available to make a tentative ruling on the merits of the claim, liability may be expressly denied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims that may be considered under more than one chapter.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In doubtful cases as to whether subparts C, D and F are the appropriate chapters to consider the claim, the claimant
will be advised of the alternatives; for example, the right to sue or the right to appeal. Similarly, a claimant may
be advised of his or her alternative remedies when the claimant is a military member and the issue of ``incident to service''
is not clear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Denial after litigation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On those claims cognizable under the FTCA in which the claimant files suit after six months without agency action,
a formal denial will be sent to the claimant unless the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for the litigation
of the suit expressly directs otherwise. The denial will be on the basis that the claim is no longer amenable to administrative
settlement. Other reasons for denial may also be given.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides an expeditious procedure for the investigation and payment of claims (regardless of the amount
claimed) that may be without extensive investigation. If it appears that a claim should be denied or cannot be settled
within the limits specified in this section, it will be fully investigated under normal procedures. The use of small
claims procedures is not mandatory; however, these procedures should be used whenever considered appropriate in
the judgment of the claims approval or settlement authority, as considerable processing time and expense is usually
saved thereby. If a fully investigated claim is received by an approval or settlement authority, which in his or her
opinion could properly have been processed under small claims procedures, the claim will be settled in accordance
with normal procedures. Appropriate corrective action will be taken to ensure the use of small claims procedures
in similar future cases.

Investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The investigation will be made so as to develop most expeditiously the facts necessary to determine whether the claim
is meritorious and in what amount. The evidence required may be obtained by telephone, from incident reports, and
other forms of hearsay evidence. Written statements of witnesses, written estimates of repairs, and the like are
not required. The approving authority must be convinced and state on DA Form 1668 that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The United States is liable for the damage or injury incurred. (b) The claimant is a proper claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The amount approved, as claimed or agreed upon, is reasonably substantiated.

Report of investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When it appears that a small claim may arise, the report of investigation will be prepared on DA Form 1668. The investigator
will append a brief summary of the evidence developed. The summary may be used as a basis for completion of the investigation
after a claim has been filed. This report is exempted from control in accordance with AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 7&hyph;2t.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If the amount claimed under chapter 11 is not more than $1,000, or in the case of a tort claim is not more than $2500,
and is considered meritorious in full, the claims JA/attorney will complete DD Form 1842 or DA Form 1668 and pay the
claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A claim under subpart K is meritorious in an amount of $1,000 or less, or if a tort claim is meritorious in the amount
of $2500 or less, the claim JA/attorney may settle the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) After coordination with the responsible approving or settlement authority, unit claims officers may be authorized
to attempt to procure a settlement agreement. If a settlement agreement is obtained, the claims officer will complete
the small claims certificate for amount of recommended payment and transmit it, in triplicate, with the claim and
settlement agreement, to the approval or settlement authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If a claimant refuses to accept a sum offered under this section or if it appears that a claim should be disapproved,
the small claims procedures will not be employed; the claim will be fully investigated and processed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Nonappropriated fund claims will be forwarded by the approval or settlement authority for payment as prescribed
in subpart L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Claims under chapter 11. DA Form 1668 will not be employed in the settlement of small claims under chapter 11. Such
a claim will be submitted on DD Form 1842. Procedures in subpart K will be used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Caused by an act or omission determined to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military personnel
or civilian officers or employees of the DA acting within the scope of their employment, including certain Red Cross

Property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The loss or damage to property that may be the subject of claims under this chapter includes_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Real property used and occupied under lease, express or implied, or otherwise (for example, in connection with
training, field exercises, or maneuvers). An allowance may be made for the use and occupancy of real property arising

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Registered or insured mail in the possession of the DA, even though the loss was caused by a criminal act. (See DA

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(e) Is based solely on compassionate grounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Is for war trophies or articles intended directly or indirectly for persons other than the claimant or members
of his or her immediate family, such as articles acquired to be disposed of as gifts or for sale to another, voluntarily
bailed to the Army, or is for precious jewels or other articles of extraordinary value voluntarily bailed to the Army.
The preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made
for any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation
of DA directives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property
or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by &sect;536.50(b). Real estate claims founded upon contract
are generally processed under AR 405&hyph;15. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;46.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Is not in the best interests of the United States, is contrary to public policy, or is otherwise contrary to the basic
intent of the governing statute (10 U.S.C. 2733); for example, claims by inhabitants of unfriendly foreign countries
or by or based on injury or death of individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States. When a claim is considered
to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, it will be forwarded for appropriate action to the Commander,
USARCS, together with the recommendations of the responsible claims office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict
with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the appropriate settlement authority
determines that the claimant is and, at the time of the incident, was friendly to the United States. A prisoner of war
or an interned enemy alien is not excluded as to a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property in the
custody of the Government otherwise payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Is for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard or a civilian employee that is incident
to his or her service (10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Claims having multiple remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims cognizable under other chapters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Claims based upon a single act or incident cognizable under this subpart and subparts H or K will be first considered
under the latter chapters; if not payable under any of those chapters, the claim will be considered under this chapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A claim may not be paid under this chapter if it is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (subpart E) or the Foreign
Claims Act (subpart J). (See 10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where a Status of Forces Agreement or other agreement provides for host country adjudication of a claim, the treaty
process may be the claimants exclusive remedy (see subpart G). Where a foreign country is responsible for adjudication
of the claim under the terms of such an agreement, it may not be paid under the provisions of this chapter. If the foreign
country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions,
the chief of a command claims service or, where the estimated value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander,
USARCS may authorize adjudication of the claim under this chapter. The mere fact a foreign country fails to pay the
claims on its merits is not sufficient basis for invoking this authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims based upon multiple acts or theories of liability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where claims cognizable under this chapter are based upon more than one act or injury and where one or more of the acts
or injuries are also cognizable under the FTCA (subpart D) (for example, claims alleging acts of medical malpractice
both in a foreign country and in the United States or claims alleging negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity),
the claims will be processed as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Meritorious claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is not cognizable under subpart D, the claim
may be considered and paid under this chapter. However, the settlement agreement must expressly release the United
States from any further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which
the claim was based. If the claim is over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS prior to
final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is cognizable under subpart D, the claim
will be first considered under subpart D. If the claim is determined by proper authority to be nonmeritorious under
subpart D but meritorious under this subpart (for example, negligence occurred overseas but none occurred in the
United States or there is no negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), it may be considered and paid under
this subpart. However, an agreed settlement must be reached that expressly releases the United States from further
liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based.
If the claim was presented in an amount over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonmeritorious claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where claims are based upon multiple acts or incidents, some or all of which may be cognizable under subpart D (FTCA),
extreme care will be taken prior to any disapproval based upon this chapter. Whether a claim is covered by Cognizability
under the FTCA is a litigable issue. Such claims will be disapproved under this chapter only as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A claim presented in an amount not over $25,000, may be disapproved by an office with settlement authority having
jurisdiction over the claim only if the claim is determined to be nonmeritorious under both this subpart and subpart
D; however the disapproval procedures established in subpart D must be fully satisfied. In such cases, the disapproval
notification will advise the claimant of his or her concurrent rights to appeal the disapproval under this subpart
or to institute suit under the FTCA. (See &sect;536.63.) In case of doubt concerning the applicability of this paragraph,
the question will be referred to USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Claims of the type covered by this paragraph, which are presented in an amount over $25,000, will be disapproved
only by the USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims in litigation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disposition under this chapter of any claim of the type covered by this paragraph that goes into litigation in any State
or Federal court under any State or Federal statute or ordinance will be suspended pending disposition of such litigation,
and the claim file will be forwarded to USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, in coordination with the U.S. Department of
Justice, may determine that final disposition under this chapter during pendency of the litigation is in the best
interests of the United States. This paragraph will also apply to any litigation brought against any agent of the United
States in his or her individual capacity that is based upon the same acts or incidents upon which a claim under the chapter
is based.

When claim must be presented.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A claim may be settled under this chapter only if presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. If a claim accrues
in time of war or armed conflict, or if war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good cause
is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after war or armed conflict is terminated. As used in this
paragraph, a war or armed conflict is one in which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged. The dates of commencement
and termination of an armed conflict must be established by concurrent resolution of Congress or by determination
of the President.

Where claim must be presented. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim must be presented to an agency or instrumentality of the DA. However, the statute of limitations is tolled if
a claim is filed with another Government agency and forwarded to the DA within 6 months, or if the claimant makes inquiry
of the DA concerning his or her claim within 6 months after it was filed with another agency of the Government. If a claim
is received by an official of the DA who is not a claims approval or settlement authority under this chapter, the claim
will be transmitted without delay to the nearest claims office or JA office for delivery to such an office.

Law applicable to liability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims arising within the United States, and its territories, commonwealths and possessions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As to claims arising in the United States, its territories, commonwealths, and possessions, the law of the place where
the act or omission occurred will be applied in determining liability and the effect of contributory negligence on
the claimant's right to recover damages. However, theories of strict or absolute liability will not be applicable
to claims under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims arising within foreign countries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For claims arising in a foreign country, liability of the United States will be assessed by reference to the law
of the District of Columbia applicable to torts committed in and having their operative effect in the District (i.e.
District of Columbia choice of law rules will not be applicable). The United States shall be liable in the same manner
and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, except that theories of absolute or strict
liability may not be applied under this chapter. Damages will be determined under the provisions of &sect;&sect;536.56
through 536.59. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The law of the place in which the alleged negligent act occurred will be applied to determine the effect of the claimant's
own negligence on the merits of the claim. Where there is no law on this issue, the MCA requires application of traditional
rules of contributory negligence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In traffic accident cases, questions of negligence, and the degree of the claimant's comparative negligence,
will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated based on the traffic and vehicle safety laws and regulations of the country in which the accident occurred,
but only to the extent they are not specifically superseded or preempted by U.S. military traffic regulations. Likewise,
where a claim is based on the failure to comply with some safety or regulatory standard, the standard applicable at
time and in the place where the claim arose will be used, rather than any comparable standard in the District of Columbia.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The measure of damages in property claims arising in the United States or its possessions will be determined in accordance
with the law of the place where the incident occurred. The measure of damages in property claims arising overseas will
be determined in accordance with the law of the District of Columbia (see &sect;536.55(a). However, punitive or exemplary
damages, including damages considered punitive in nature under 28 U.S.C. 2674, and interest on any settlement are
not payable.

(a) Where a claim for an injury, or injury resulting in death, arises outside of the United States or its possessions,
the elements of damages payable under this subpart will be the same as those payable in a similar claim arising under
the law of the District of Columbia applicable to torts committed in and having their operative effect in the District
of Columbia. The amount paid will be based on generally accepted economic principles. All awards for future payments
of economic damages will be discounted to present value. Awards under this chapter will be reduced by any benefits
which have been or are reasonably likely to be paid, if the benefit or payment is from the general revenues of the United
States and the claimant did not contribute to or purchase the benefit. In death cases, taxes and personal consumption
will be deducted from any award for lost economic contribution or lost earnings. Punitive or exemplary damages, including
damages considered punitive in nature under 28 U.S.C. 2674, and interest on any settlement are not payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) A claimant who alleges a serious personal injury resulting in temporary or permanent disability should be examined
by an independent physician or other medical specialist. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the examination is not just to confirm the impairment but also to help assess its extent, prognosis and treatment.

(a) The Government is not obligated to take final action on a claim until it has been supported by the claimant with specific
facts substantiated by appropriate documentary evidence, reports of investigation, medical records, or witness
statements. As the burden of proof is on the claimant, the failure to substantiate a claim within a reasonable time
can be the basis for denial of the claim. Upon request, the claimant must_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide the documentation required by sections &sect;&sect;536.56 through 536.58.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Submit an expert opinion in a professional negligence action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Approval and settlement authorities will follow the procedures set forth in subpart B in paying, denying, or making
final offers on claims. A copy of the notification will be forwarded to Commander, USARCS. The settlement authority
will notify the claimant by certified mail (return receipt requested) of a denial or final offer and the reason therefor
as set forth in &sect;536.37. The letter of notification will inform claimants of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) They must accept or appeal as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The official who will act on the appeal and that the appeal will be addressed to the settlement authority who last
acted on the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No form is prescribed for the appeal but claimants must fully set forth the grounds for appeal, or state that they
appeal on the basis of the record as it exists at the time of denial or final offer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The appeal must be postmarked not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notice of action on the claim.
If the last day of the appeal period falls on a day on which the post office is closed, the next day on which it is open for
business will be considered the final day of the appeal period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Acceptance and appeal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For final offers, a settlement agreement releasing the government from all liability will be mailed along with the
final offer notice. Claimants will be advised that they must either submit an appeal or accept the offer within 180
days of the date of mailing of the final offer notice. If they fail to do either, the offer will be withdrawn, the claim
will be denied and the file will be closed without further recourse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Companion FTCA claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where a claim for the same injury has been filed under subpart D, and the denial or final offer applies equally to such
claim, the letter of notification must advise the claimant that any suit brought as to any portion of the claim filed
under the FTCA must be brought not later than 6 months from the date of mailing of the notice of denial or final offer.
Further, the claimant must be advised that if suit is brought, action on any appeal under this subpart will be held in
abeyance pending final determination of such suit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The appeal will be examined by the settlement authority who last acted on the claim or his or her successor, to determine
if the appeal complies with the requirements of this regulation. The settlement authority will also examine the claims
investigative file and decide whether additional investigation is required; ensure that all allegations or evidence
presented by the claimant, agent, or attorney are documented in the file; and ensure that all pertinent evidence is
included in the file. If the claimant states that he or she appeals, but does not submit supporting materials within
the 180 day appeal period, the appeal will be treated as being on the record as it existed at the time of denial or final
offer. Unless action under paragraph (b) of this section is taken, the claim and complete investigative file, including
any additional investigation required, and a tort claims memorandum will be forwarded to the appropriate appellate
authority for necessary action on the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the evidence in the file, including information submitted by the claimant with the appeal and any necessary
additional investigation, indicates the appeal should be granted, in whole or in part, the settlement authority
who last acted on the claim or his or her successor will attempt to settle the claim. If a settlement cannot be reached,
the appeal will be forwarded in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As to an appeal that requires action by TJAG, TAJAG, or the Secretary of the Army or designee, the Commander, USARCS
may take the action in paragraph (b) of this section or forward the claim together with a recommendation for action.
All matters submitted by the claimant will be forwarded and considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Since an appeal under this chapter is not an adversary proceeding, no form of hearing is authorized. A request by
the claimant for access to documentary evidence in the claims file to be used in considering the appeal should be granted
unless access is not permitted by law or regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the appeal authority upholds a final offer or authorizes an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice
of the appellate authority's action will inform the claimant that they must accept the award within 180 days of the
date of mailing of the notice of the appellate authority's action or the award will be withdrawn, the claim will be deemed
denied and the file will be closed without further recourse.

The statutory authority for this subpart is the FTCA (60 Stat. 842), (28 U.S.C. 2671&hyph;2680), as amended by the
Act of 18 July 1966 (Public Law 89&hyph;506; 80 Stat. 306), Public Law 93&hyph;253, 16 March 1974 (88 Stat. 50), and
Public Law 97&hyph;124, 29 December 1981, and as implemented by the Attorney General's Regulations (28 CFR 14.1&hyph;14.11).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement
of claims against the United States under the FTCA and the implementing Attorney General's Regulations (DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
appendix H) based on death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property that accrues on or after 18 January 1967.
If a conflict exists between this regulation and the Attorney General's Regulations, the latter governs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Citations to cases interpreting and applying the FTCA are contained in the Federal Tort Claims Handbook provided
by USARCS. That handbook should be used in conjunction with this subpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Unless otherwise prescribed, claims for death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property (real or personal)
are payable under this subpart the injury or damage is caused by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of military
personnel or civilian employees of the DA or DOD while acting within the scope of their employment under circumstances
in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place
where the act or omission occurred. The FTCA is a limited consent to liability without which the United States is immune.
Similarly, there is no Federal cause of action created by the Constitution that would permit a damage recovery because
of the Fifth Amendment or any other constitutional provision. Immunity must be expressly waived, as by the FTCA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Members of the ARNG while engaged in training or duty under Title 32 U.S.C. sections 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505
for claims arising on or after 29 December 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Civilian officials and employees of both the DOD and DA (there is no practical significance to the distinction
between the terms ``official'' and ``employee'') including but not limited to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Civil Service and other full-time employees of both the DOD and DA paid from appropriated funds.

AR 40&hyph;1, paragraph 4&hyph;3; CPR A&hyph;9; FPM chapter 304) where ``control'' is exercised over physician's
day to day practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Employees of nonappropriated funds if the particular fund is an instrumentality of the United States and thus
a Federal agency. In determining whether or not a particular fund is a ``Federal agency,'' consider whether the fund
is an integral part of the Army charged with an essential DA operational function and the degree of control and supervision
exercised by DA personnel. Members or users, as distinguished from employees of nonappropriated funds, are not considered
Government employees; the same is true of family child care providers. However, claims arising out of the use of certain
nonappropriated fund property, or the acts or omissions of family child care providers, may be payable from such funds
under subpart L as a matter of policy, even when the user is not within the scope of employment and the claim is not otherwise
cognizable under any of the other authorizations in this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (viii) National Guard technicians employed under 32 U.S.C. 709(a) for claims accruing on or after 1 January 1969 (Public
Law 90&hyph;486, 13 Aug. 1968; 82 Stat. 755). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) Persons acting in an official capacity for the DOD or DA whether temporarily or permanently in the service of the
United States with or without compensation including but not limited to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) ``Dollar a year'' personnel.

 (ii) Members of advisory committees, commissions, boards, or the like. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Volunteer workers in an official capacity acting in furtherance of the business of the United States. The general
rule with respect to volunteers is set forth in 31 U.S.C. 665(b), which provides that, ``No officer or employee of the
United States shall accept voluntary service for the United States or employ personal service in excess of that authorized
by law, except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.'' Title 5, United
States Code, section 3111(c) specifically provides that student volunteers employed thereunder will be considered
Federal employees for purposes of the FTCA. The same classification is applied by 10 U.S.C. 1588 to museum and family
support program volunteers. The Army is permitted to accept and use certain volunteer services in Army family support
programs as authorized by Public Law 98&hyph;94, September 24, 1983. Red Cross volunteers meeting the criteria set
forth in AR 40&hyph;3, paragraph 2&hyph;42, are also considered to be employees of the United States for claims purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Loaned servants. Employees who are permitted to serve another employer may be considered ``loaned servants,''
provided the borrowing employer has the power to discharge the employee, control and direct the employee, and decide
how he or she will perform the tasks. Whoever has retained those powers is liable for the employee's torts under the
principle of respondent superior. Where those elements of direction and control have been found, the United States
has been liable; for example, for the torts of Government employees loaned for medical training and emergency assistance
and county and state employees discharging Federal programs.

 means acting in ``line of [military] duty'' (28 U.S.C. 2671) and is determined in accordance with principles of respondent
superior under the law of the jurisdiction in which that act or omission occurred. Determination as to whether a person
is within a category listed in (b)(3) of this section will usually be made together with the scope determination. Local
law should always be researched, but the novel aspects of the military relationship should be kept in mind in making
a scope determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) ``Line of duty'' determinations under AR 600&hyph;8&hyph;1 are not determinative of scope of employment. ``Joint
venture'' situations are likely to be frequent where the Federal employee is performing federally assigned duties
but is under actual direction and control of a non-Federal entity; for example, a Federal employee in training at a
non-Federal entity or ROTC instructors at civilian institutions. This could also occur where the employee is working
for another Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Furthermore, dual purpose situations are commonplace where benefits to the Government and the member or employee
may or may not be concurrent; for example, use of privately owned vehicles at or away from assigned duty station, or
permanent change of station with delay en route. (See subpart E for the handling of certain claims arising out of nonscope
activities of members of the Army.)

 It is the policy of the Department of Justice that, if the claim arises under circumstances in which the Government
is entitled to contribution or indemnity under a contract of insurance or the applicable law governing joint tortfeasors,
the third party will be notified of the claim and will be requested to honor its obligation to the United States or to
accept its share of joint liability. (See &sect;&sect;536.28 and 536.29.) If the issue of indemnity or contribution
is not satisfactorily adjusted, the claim will be compromised or settled only after consultation with the Department
of Justice as provided in &sect;536.75(s).

 Claims for indemnity or contribution from the United States will be compromised or settled under this chapter, if

under this chapter. As to such claims where the exclusivity provisions of the FECA may be applicable, see &sect;536.75(s).

ARNG vehicular claims.

 (1) When a vehicle used by the ARNG, or a POV operated by a member or employee of the ARNG, is involved in an incident under
circumstances that make this chapter applicable to the disposition of administrative claims against the United
States and results in personal injury, death, or property damage, and a remedy against the State, or its insurer is
indicated, the responsible area claims authority will monitor the action against the State or its insurer and encourage
direct settlement between the claimant and the State or its insurer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular
procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by both local
authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence by Commander, USARCS. Such procedures
will be designed to ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for
processing claims and, whenever possible and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement
for disposition of such claims as in paragraph (d) of this section is worked out.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Contribution may be sought from the State involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it has waived sovereign immunity or has private insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would cover the incident giving rise to the particular claim. Where the State involved rejects the request for
contribution, the file will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, is authorized to enter
into an agreement with a State, territory, or commonwealth to share settlement costs of claims generated by the ARNG
personnel or activities of that political entity.

Exclusions listed in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680. The remainder
are based either on statute or court decisions. The interpretation of these exclusions is a Federal question to be
decided under Federal law; for example, the tort of assault and battery listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(h) should be interpreted
in accordance with Federal common law principles, and where State law differs, the former will prevail. Where a claim
is considered not payable under this paragraph, consult DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8 for other methods of handling.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Is based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute
or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid (28 U.S.C. 2680(a)). Where no negligence on the part
of any Government employee is shown, and the only ground for the claim is the contention that the same conduct by a private
individual would be tortious, or that the statute or regulation authorizing the project was invalid, the sole question
is the existence of the statute or regulation, not its validity. However, a claim should not be denied based solely
on this exception without the prior approval of the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty
on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved is abused (28
U.S.C. 2680(a)). A claim should not be denied solely because of this exception without the prior approval of the Commander,
USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Arises out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter (28 U.S.C. 2680(b)).
It should be noted that administrative settlement and payment of certain mail claims is authorized under subparts
C and F. Further, a limited indemnity may be obtained through other channels for the loss or damage to registered, insured,
and C.O.D. mail (39 U.S.C. 5001, et. seq.) (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;61.) The exclusion may not be
applicable where State law recognizes a cause of action for invasion of privacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Arises with respect to the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise
by any customs or other law-enforcement officer (28 U.S.C. 2680(c)). Adequate remedies are available to anyone aggrieved
by the application of the tax or customs laws of the United States (26 U.S.C. 6213), or the claimant may pay the tax and
sue in the U.S. Claims Court or the appropriate U.S. District Court for a refund (28 U.S.C. 1491 and 1346(a)(1)). Other
remedies are also available for the loss or detention of goods or merchandise; for example, Tucker Act, bailment provisions
of the MCA (chap 3), or destruction of evidence for scientific analysis (AR 190&hyph;22, paragraph 3&hyph;8). With
respect to the detention of goods by a law enforcement officer, this exception may apply to seizures in connection
with an arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Is cognizable under the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C. 740&hyph;752) or under the Public Vessels Act (46 U.S.C.
781&hyph;790). To be cognizable under this exclusion, the tort must have both a maritime situs and a maritime nexus,
otherwise the tort is cognizable under the FTCA. Maritime claims may be considered under The Army Maritime Claims
Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4801, et. seq.) and subpart H, and they must be settled or suit filed within 2 years of accrual
of claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Arises out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering the provisions of the Trading
With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. appendix 1&hyph;31; 28 U.S.C. 2680(e)). That Act provides that the sole remedy of any
person claiming money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian is as provided by that Act. This exception
should be broadly construed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Is for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States (28 U.S.C. 2680(f)).
Claims for failure to impose a quarantine or delay in enforcing a quarantine come within the discretionary function
exclusion discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Arises out of an assault or battery (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Often artful pleading is employed to create a cause of action in negligence, such as alleging negligent supervision;
such does not create a separate cause of action as the exception bars a claim arising out of an assault and battery even
though there may have been negligent supervision. Under the 1974 amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), the activities of
law enforcement officers that result in an assault or battery are removed from this exception and can create a cause
of action. Such activities have accounted for most of the past claims and litigation involving the assault and battery
exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Therefore, any claim alleging use of threatening or deadly force, especially by a law enforcement officer, must
be thoroughly investigated to determine whether the nature, amount, and use of such force was justified under the
circumstances. (See paragraph (i) of this section for definition of investigative or law enforcement officer).
Also, section 2680(h) does not apply to a claim arising out of performance of medical, dental or related health care
functions (10 U.S.C. 1089(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Arises out of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution or abuse of process (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).
This exception has universal applicability to all acts of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution,
or abuse of process when committed by an employee of the United States in the scope of employment. However, by amendment
to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), this exception is not applicable on or after 16 March 1974 to such actions when committed by an
investigative or law enforcement officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, seize evidence,
or make arrests for violations of Federal law (88 Stat. 50). Such employees are considered to include military police,
but not post exchange detectives. Whether or not a Federal law enforcement officer is involved, the defense of probable
cause, reasonableness, and good faith are available, provided the arrest is otherwise lawful under State law. DA
Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;8c, refers to certain claims based on unjust convictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(j) Arises out of libel, slander, misrepresentation, or deceit (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). The misrepresentation exception
has been broadly construed to include negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation. It has not been applied
in situations involving negligent failure to perform some operational task or to convey information related to public
safety independent of any secondary misstatement. Where an erroneous medical diagnosis is made, the exception does
not apply because malpractice is the gravamen of the action and the misrepresentation incidental. Similarly, the
misrepresentation exception was held not applicable where the United States sold bomb casings to a scrap dealer expressly
warranting that they were safe and fit for scrap metal processing, and one of the castings exploded. Before this exception
can be applied in the determination of an administrative tort claim, the claims investigation must consider the nature
of the Government's acts or omissions, as well as the information upon which the claimant may have relied to his or her
detriment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Arises out of interference with contract rights (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). This exception includes both interference
with existing contract rights and interference with prospective or executed contract rights or economic advantage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Arises from the fiscal operations of the Department of the Treasury or from the regulation of the monetary system
(28 U.S.C. 2680(i)). This exception includes all disbursing operations of the DA or other military services. However,
such claims may be forwarded through Army finance channels for consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Arises out of the combat activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war (28 U.S.C.
2680(j)). ``Combat activities'' is defined in the glossary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) Arises in a foreign country (28 U.S.C. 2680(k)). There is no clear delineation of what constitutes a foreign country.
However, the exception has been held applicable to claims arising in a leased military base in Newfoundland; in the
American Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand; on Okinawa under the de facto sovereignty of the United States; on Kwajalein
under the trusteeship of the United States; and to various occupied countries. (See subpart J and DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 821, for handling of certain claims arising in a foreign country.) Where the actionable negligence has
occurred in the United States and only the consequences occurred in a foreign country, this exception has not been
applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) Arises from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority (28 U.S.C. 2680(i) and 16 U.S.C. 831 et. seq.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(p) Arises from the activities of the Panama Canal Commission (28 U.S.C. 2680(m)). (See 76A Stat. 22 through 25, and
22 U.S.C. 3761.) Claims accruing after the effective date of the Panama Canal Treaty (1 October 1979) may be cognizable
under either the FCA or the MCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(q) Arises from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or bank for cooperatives
(28 U.S.C. 2680(n)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(r) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States incurred incident to service,
or for damage to a member's property incurred incident to service (

, 340 U.S. 135 (1950)). (See &sect;536.25 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;26 through 8&hyph;28.) Currently
the most significant justification for the incident to service doctrine is the availability of alternative compensation
systems, and the fear of disrupting the military command relationship. Other supportive factors often cited by the
courts are the service member's duty status, location, and receipt of military benefits at the time of the incident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The exception applies to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including the Reserve
Components of the Armed Forces. (See 10 U.S.C. 261.) The exception also applies to service members on the Temporary
Disability Retired List, on convalescent leave, and on the extended enlistment program; to service academy cadets;
and to members of visiting forces in the United States under the SOFA between the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty
or similar international agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The incident to service doctrine has been extended to derivative claims where the directly injured party is a service
member. Third party indemnity claims are barred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(s) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C.
8101- 8150). (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) Who is a Government employee under the Act is defined
in the Act itself (5 U.S.C. 8101), but the term is not limited to Federal Civil Service employees. The term ``Government
employee'' can include certain ROTC cadets (5 U.S.C. 8140) and State or local law enforcement officers engaged in
apprehending a person for committing a crime against the United States (5 U.S.C. 8191), certain nurses, interns,
or other health care personnel, for example, student nurses, (5 U.S.C. 5351, 8144), and certain Army Community Service
Volunteers (10 U.S.C. 1588; AR 608&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) This Act provides that benefits paid under this Act are exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United
States, including that under a Federal tort liability statute (5 U.S.C. 8116(c)). It extends to derivative claims,
subsequent malpractice for treatment of a covered injury, injuries for which there is no scheduled compensation,
and employee harassment claims for which other remedies are available (42 U.S.C. 2000e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is from a federal civilian employee based on a allegation of a violation of some employment right or is otherwise
one for which the rules governing federal civilian employment provide a comprehensive remedy. Such claims often
allege emotional distress or psychological injury as a result of the alleged misconduct. Administrative remedies
under the civil service regulations are the employee's exclusive remedy. Bush v. Lucas 462 U.S. 367 (1983). This exception
does not bar third party indemnity claims. When there is doubt as to whether or not this exception applies, the claim
should be forwarded through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, for an opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(t) Is for the personal injury or death of an employee including nonappropriated fund employees, for whom benefits
are provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950). An employee of
a nonappropriated fund instrumentality is covered by the Act (5 U.S.C. 8171). This is exclusive for covered employees,
similar to that under the FECA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(u) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under any workmen's compensation
law if the premiums of the workmen's compensation insurance are retrospectively rated and charged as an allowable,
allocable expense to a cost-type contract. (See &sect;536.28 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) If,
in the opinion of an approval or settlement authority the claim should be considered payable (for example, the injuries
did not result from a normal risk of employment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation
laws), the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS who may authorize
payment of an appropriate award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Is for taking of property as by technical trespass or overflight of aircraft and of a type contemplated by the Fifth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or otherwise constitutes attacking. (See paragraph 2c of AR 405&hyph;15 and
DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;46, 8&hyph;74, and 8&hyph;75.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in part ``*&blank;*&blank;* nor shall private property
be taken for public use, without just compensation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims for takings without just compensation are actionable under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) and 1491,
Appendix A., 24 Stat. 505 (1887)). Prior to referring a claimant to a Tucker Act remedy, the applicability of the procedures
under AR 405&hyph;15 should be considered by referral to appropriate Corps of Engineers authorities. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;75.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(w) Is for damage from or by flood or flood waters at any place (33 U.S.C. 702c). This exception is broadly construed
and includes multipurpose projects and all phases of construction and operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury occurring directly or indirectly as a result of the
exercise of performance of, or failure to exercise or perform, any function or duty by any Federal agency or employee
of the Government to carry out the provisions of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 during the existence of a civil
defense emergency (50 U.S.C. Appendix 2291&hyph;2297). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(y) Is based solely upon a theory of absolute liability or liability without fault. Either a negligent or wrongful
act is required by the FTCA, and some type of malfeasance or nonfeasance is required (Dalehite v. United States, 346
U.S. 15 (1953); Laird v. Nelms, 406 U.S. 797 (1972)). Thus, liability does not arise by virtue either of United States
ownership of an inherently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangerous commodity or of engaging in extra-hazardous activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(z) Is for patent or copyright infringement. (See AR 27&hyph;60.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(aa) Claims for damage to property of a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia caused by ARNG
personnel engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 who are assigned to a unit maintained
by that State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia will not be paid without the express approval
of the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(bb) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury arising out of the activities of any Federal agency
or employee of the Government in carrying out the provisions of the Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1954 (Public Law
93&hyph;288, Sec. 403, 88 Stat. 143). The Act requires the local beneficiary (State or local government) to hold the
Government harmless and to assume the defense of all claims arising from the removal of debris and wreckage from public
or private property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cc) Arises from activities that present a nonjusticiable political question. The courts search for six factors,
as follows, any one of which is grounds for dismissal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A commitment of the issue to a coordinate branch of Government by the text of the Constitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The impossibility of deciding without a policy determination calling for non-judicial discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The impossibility of undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect for coordinate
branches of Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The potential for embarrassment from multiple pronouncements by various departments on one question.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. Unless inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the procedures for the investigation and processing
of claims set forth in subpart B will be followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims arising out of tortious conduct by ARNG personnel defined in &sect;536.71(b)(1)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notification and investigation. The procedures in &sect;&sect; 536.97 and 536.98 will be followed in NG claims
arising under the FTCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims against the U.S. Government received by agencies of the State. These claims will be expeditiously forwarded
through the State adjutant general to the appropriate U.S. Army area claims office in whose geographic area the incident
occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Statute of limitations. (1) To be settled under this chapter, a claim against the United States must be presented
in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years of its accrual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For statute of limitations purposes, a claim will be deemed to have been presented when the appropriate Federal
agency (as defined in the glossary) receives from a claimant or his or her duly authorized agent or legal representative,
an executed SF 95 or written notification of an incident, together with a claim for money damages, in a sum certain,
for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or death. For Federal tort claims arising out of activities of the
NG, receipt of a written claim by any full time officer or employee of the NG will be considered proper receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A claim received by an official of the DOD will be transmitted without delay to the nearest Army claims processing
office or area claims office. Inquiries concerning applicability of the statute of limitations to claims filed with
the wrong Federal Agency will be referred to USARCS for resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Claims within settlement authority of USARCS or the Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A copy of each of the type of claims described below will be forwarded immediately to the Commander, USARCS. (Subsequent
documents should be forwarded or added in accordance with &sect;536.22(b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Claims that appear to be of a type that must be brought to the attention of the Attorney General in accordance with
his or her regulations (28 CFR 14.6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A claim in which the demand exceeds $25,000 or the total amount of all claims, actual or potential, from a single
incident exceeds $25,000 $50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) USARCS is responsible for the monitoring and settlement of such claims and will be kept informed of the status of
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation and processing thereof. Direct liaison and correspondence between USARCS and the field claims authority
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigator is authorized on all claims matters and assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be furnished as required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Non-Army claims. Claims based on acts or omissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees of the United States, other than military and civilian personnel of the DA, civilian personnel of the DOD,
and employees of nonappropriated fund activities of the DA will be transmitted forthwith to the nearest official
of the employing agency; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant will be advised of the referral. (See &sect;536.18 (c) and (d) for further guidance when more than one Federal
agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Acknowledgment of claim. (1) The claimant and his or her attorney will be kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed by personal contact, telephonic contact, or mail of the receipt of his or her claim and the status of the claim.
Formal acknowledgment of the claim in writing is required only where the claim is likely to result in litigation or
is presented in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount exceeding $15,000. In this event, the letter of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledgment will state the date of receipt of the claim by the first agency of the Army receiving the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If it is reasonably clear to the office acknowledging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt that a claim filed under the FTCA is not cognizable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereunder; for example, it is a maritime claim under chapter 8, or it falls under subparts C or F, the acknowledgment
will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain a statement advising the claimant of the statute under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which his or her claim will be processed. If it is not clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which subpart applies, a statement to that effect will be made and the claimant will be promptly advised when a decision
is made. However all potential maritime claims will be handled in accordance with &sect;536.21(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When a claim has been amended as set forth in &sect;536.20(f)(4), the amendment will be acknowledged in all cases.
Also, the claimant will be informed that the amendment constitutes a new claim insofar as concerns the 6 months in which
the DA is granted the authority to make a final disposition under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) and the claimant's option thereunder
will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When a claim is improperly presented, is incomplete, or otherwise does not meet the requirements set forth in &sect;536.20(d),
the claimant or his or her representative will be promptly informed in writing of the deficiencies and advised that
a proper claim must be filed within the 2 year statute of limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Investigation. Claims cognizable under this regulation will be investigated and processed on a priority basis
in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that settlement if indicated may be accomplished within the 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months prescribed by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Advice to claimant. (1) A full explanation of claims procedures and of the rights of the claimant will be made to
the extent necessitated by the amount and nature of the claim.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) In a case where litigation is likely, or where this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of action is preferred by the claimant, and it appears to be a proper case for administrative settlement, the
claimant will be advised as to the advantages of administrative settlement. If the claim is within the jurisdiction
of a higher settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, the claim will be discussed with such authority prior to the furnishing of such advice. The claimant should
be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarized with all aspects of administrative settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures including the administrative channels through which the claim must be processed for approval. He or she
may be advised that administrative processing can result in more expeditious processing, whereas litigation may
take considerable time, particularly in jurisdictions with crowded dockets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If appropriate, the claimant may be informed that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative settlement can be reached for any amount, but that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awards in excess of $200,000 are subject to approval by the Attorney General. The claimant should be advised that administrative
filing of the claim protects him or her under the statute of limitations for purpose of litigation and that a suit can
be filed within 6 months after the date of mailing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of final denial by the DA, thus potentially allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations to continue indefinitely. An attorney representing a claimant should be advised of the limitations
on fees for purposes of administrative settlement (20 percent) and litigation (25 percent) and that there is no jury
trial under the FTCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification to claimant of action on claim. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The filing of an administrative claim and its denial are prerequisite to filing suit. Any suit must be filed not
later than 6 months after notification by certified or registered mail of the denial of the administrative claim.
Failure of a settlement authority to take final action on a properly filed claim within 6 months may be treated by the
claimant as a final denial for the purposes of filing suit. If the claimant has provided insufficient documentation
to permit evaluation of the claim, written notice should be given to this effect. Since administrative settlements
are a voluntary process, the preferred method of negotiating is to attempt to exchange information on an open basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upon final denial of a claim, or upon rejection by claimant of a partial allowance, if further efforts to reach a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement are not considered feasible (&sect;536.21(b)(1)), the settlement authority will inform the claimant
of the action on his or her claim by certified or registered mail. Notification will be made as set forth in &sect;536.37(b).
A copy of this notification will be furnished to Litigation Division, OTJAG, and the Commander, USARCS. In all medical
malpractice cases, a copy will be furnished to the Consultation Case Review Branch (CCRB), Office of the Surgeon Command
and the SJA, Health Services Command. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a claim has been presented to the DA and, also, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal agencies, without any notification to the DA of this fact, final action taken by the DA prior to that of
any other agency is conclusive on a claim presented to other agencies unless another agency decides to take further
action to settle the claim. Such agency may treat the matter as a reconsideration under 28 CFR 14.9(b) unless suit has
been filed. (See &sect;536.82.) The foregoing applies likewise to Army claims in which another Federal Agency has
taken final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If, after final denial by another agency, a claim is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed with the Army, the new submission will not toll the 6 months limitation for filing suit unless the DA treats the
second submission as a request for reconsideration under &sect;536.82.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acceptance by the claimant of an award, compromise, or settlement made pursuant to this chapter will be final and

may submit a written request for reconsideration (&sect;536.82), in lieu of filing suit, to the Commander, USARCS
(through the office issuing the disapproval or final offer) provided that the request is received prior to the expiration
of the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Once received, the claimant will be advised in writing that the
request will suspend the option to bring suit under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) for 6 months from the date the request was received.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Reconsideration. An original approval or settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer on a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Settlement correction. An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct his or her action
on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part (even where a settlement agreement has been executed) when
an error contrary to the mutual understanding of the parties is discovered in the original action (e.g., a claim is
settled for $15,000 but the settlement agreement was typed to read $1500 and the error is not discovered until the file
is being prepared for payment). If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. The approval or settlement authority
will reopen his or her action on a claim when he or she has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained by means of
fraud by the claimant (or claimant's authorized agent or legal representative) and, if substantiated, will correct
his or her action. The basis for any correction of an action will be stated in a memorandum which will be included in the
file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A successor approval or settlement authority. (1) Reconsideration. A successor approval or settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer in a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative, only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence,
errors in calculation or mistake (misinterpretation) of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Settlement correction. A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's
action on a claim which was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons as an original authority, as stated
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All requests for reconsideration of a denial or final offer by a command claims service or area claims office in
which full relief is not granted will be forwarded to the Commander, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USARCS for action, with any additional investigative material and legal analysis generated by the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legal or factual basis asserted as grounds for relief.
Following completion of any investigation or other action deemed necessary for an informed disposition of the request,
the approval or settlement authority will reconsider the claim and attempt to settle it by granting such relief as
may appear warranted. When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the entire file with a memorandum of opinion
will be referred through claims channels as outlined in &sect;536.31. If a higher claims authority is unable to grant
the relief requested, he or she will forward the claim with the recommendation to the Commander, USARCS, and inform
the claimant of such reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A request for reconsideration must be filed prior to the commencement of suit and prior to the expiration of the
6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Upon timely filing, the appropriate authority will have 6 months from
the date of filing in which to make a final disposition of the request, and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a)
will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the request. The action on the request will be effected as set forth
in &sect;536.77(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Action upon a request for reconsideration by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate authority (either affirming the prior action or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granting full or partial relief) constitutes final administrative disposition of a claim. No further requests for
reconsideration will be allowed except on the basis of fraud. Attempted further requests for reconsideration on
other grounds will not toll the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b).

Statutory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the act of 9 October 1962 (76 Stat. 767, 10 U.S.C 2737). This
statute is commonly called the ``Nonscope Claims Act.'' For the purposes of this subpart, a Government installation
is a facility having fixed boundaries owned or controlled by the Government, and a vehicle includes every description
of carriage or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on land (1
U.S.C 4).

Scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement
and payment, in an amount not more than $1,000, of any claim against the United States not cognizable under any other
provision of law for damage or loss of property, or for personal injury or death caused by a member or employee of the
DA incident to the use of a U.S. vehicle at any location or incident to the use of other U.S. property on a Government installation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any claim in which there appears to be a disputed issue relating to whether the employee was acting within the scope
of employment will be considered under subparts C, D, and F of this part. Only when all parties, to include an insurer,
agree that there is no ``in scope'' issue will this chapter be used.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A claim for personal injury, death, or damage or loss of property, real or personal, is payable under this
chapter when_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Caused by the act or omission, negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of a member of the DA or the ARNG,
or a civilian employee of the DA or the ARNG_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Incident to the use of a vehicle of the United States at any place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Incident to the use of any other property of the United States on a Government installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The claim may not be settled under any other claims statute and claims regulation available to the DA for the administrative
settlement of claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claim has been determined to be meritorious, and the approval or settlement authority has obtained a settlement
agreement in an amount not in excess of $1,000 in full satisfaction of the claim prior to approval of the claim for payment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Personal injury or death. A claim for personal injury or death is allowable only for the cost of reasonable medical,
hospital, or burial expenses actually incurred and not otherwise furnished or paid by the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Property loss or damage. A claim for damage or loss of property is allowable only for the cost of reasonable repairs
or value at time of loss, whichever is less.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims not payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim is not allowable under this chapter that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Results wholly or partly from the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or his or her agent or employee. The doctrine
of comparative negligence is not applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is for medical, hospital, and burial expenses furnished or paid by the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is for any element of damage pertaining to personal injuries or death other than provided in &sect;536.85(b).
All other items of damage; for example, compensation for loss of earnings and services, diminution of earning capacity,
anticipated medical expenses, physical disfigurement, and pain and suffering are not payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is for loss of use of property or for the cost of a substitute property; for example, a rental. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Is legally recoverable by the claimant under an indemnifying law or indemnity contract. If the claim is legally
recoverable in part, that part recoverable by the claimant is not payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Is a subrogated claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Examples of claims not allowable under this chapter are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant has collision insurance covering his or her automobile with a deductible amount of $100. While the
claimant is sitting in the vehicle, which is properly parked, it is struck from the rear by an Army truck operated by
a DA civilian who had misappropriated the Government vehicle. The claimant sustains personal injuries requiring
hospitalization for 6 weeks during which actual medical and hospital expenses are incurred in the amount of $1,200.
He or she has no medical or hospitalization insurance. The damage to the vehicle totals $300. The claimant's insurance
carrier reimburses him or her $200 for the vehicle damage and becomes subrogated in that amount under the policy terms.
The claimant files a claim in the amount of $1,500, alleging $300 for property damage to the automobile and $1,200 for
medical and hospital expenses. The claim is allowable in the total amount of $1,000, consisting of $100, the insurance
deductible for property damage, and $900 of the medical and hospital expenses. The amount claimed for medical and
hospital expenses and for property damage merely constitutes separable interests in a single claim that may not be
allowed in an amount in excess of $1,000 under this chapter. The claimant's insurer is not a proper party claimant,
and no payment is allowable for the insurer's subrogated interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claimant has medical and hospitalization insurance that entitles him or her to reimbursement of up to $500 for
the reasonable cost of medical and hospital expenses incurred for personal injuries. While visiting at an Army installation
the claimant is wounded by the negligent discharge of a Government issue caliber .45 pistol by a soldier who had stolen
the weapon. The claimant is hospitalized at a civilian hospital and has incurred medical and hospital expenses of
$750. The claimant may be paid $250, the amount allowable for reasonable medical and hospital expenses actually incurred
after deduction of $500 legally recoverable by him or her under the insurance policy.

(a) An original approval or settlement authority may reconsider the quantum of a claim upon request of the claimant
or someone acting in his behalf. In the absence of such a request, an approval or settlement authority may on his or her
own initiative reconsider the quantum of a claim. Reconsideration may occur even in a claim that was previously disapproved
in whole or in part (even though a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears that his or her original action
was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence of record at the time of the action or subsequently received. If he
or she determines that the original action was incorrect, he or she will modify the action and, if appropriate, make
a supplemental payment. If the original action is determined correct, the claimant will be so notified. The basis
for either action will be stated in a memorandum included in the file.

(b) An approval or settlement authority may reconsider the applicability of this chapter to a claim upon request of
the claimant or someone acting in his behalf, or on his or her own initiative. Such reconsideration may occur even though
all parties had previously agreed per &sect;536.84 when it appears that this agreement was incorrect in law or fact
based on the evidence of record at the time of the agreement or subsequently received. If he or she determines the agreement
to be incorrect, the claim will be reprocessed under the applicable chapter of this regulation. If he or she determines
the agreement to have been correct, that is, that this subpart is applicable, he or she will so advise the claimant.
This advice will include reference to any appeal or judicial remedies available under the chapter which the claimant
alleges the claim should be processed under.

of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the Act of 13 September 1960 (74 Stat. 878, 32 U.S.C. 715),
commonly referred to as the ``National Guard Claims Act'' as amended by Public Law 90&hyph;486, 13 August 1968, (82
Stat. 756), Public Law 90&hyph;525, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 877), Public Law 901&hyph;312, 8 July 1970 (84 Stat.
412), and Public Law 93&hyph;336, 8 July 1974, and the Act of 8 September 1961 (75 Stat. 488, 10 U.S.C. 2736) as amended
by Public Law 90&hyph;521, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 874) and as amended by Public Law 98564, 20 October 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of this subpart, the following terminology applies: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ARNG personnel. A member of the ARNG engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claimant. An individual, partnership, association, corporation, country, State, commonwealth, territory,
or a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia presenting a claim and meeting the conditions set
forth in section 536.20. The term does not include the U.S. Government, any of its instrumentalities, except as prescribed
by statute, or a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia, which maintains the unit to which the
ARNG personnel causing the injury or damage are assigned. This exclusion does not ordinarily apply to a unit of local
government that does not control the ARNG organization involved. As a general rule, a claim by a unit of local government
other than a State, commonwealth, or territory will be entertained unless the item claimed to be damaged or lost was
procured or maintained by State, commonwealth, or territorial funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State. As used in this subpart the term ``state'' includes self-governing commonwealths and territories of the
United States; for example, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) This subpart is applicable in all places and sets forth the procedures to be followed in the settlement and payment
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims for death, personal injury, or damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Members or employees of the ARNG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Noncombat activities of the ARNG when engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709,
provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An employee whose injury or death is incident to service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A claimant dissatisfied with an administrative settlement under this subpart as the result of activities of the
NG of a State, Commonwealth, or Territory is not entitled to judicial relief in an action against the United States.
Whether he or she has a legal cause of action or may file an administrative claim against such political entity depends
upon controlling local law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims arising out of activities of the ARNG when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing duties at the call of the governor of a State maintaining the unit are not cognizable under this chapter
or any other law, regulation, or appropriation available to the Army for the payment of claims. Such claims should
be returned or referred to the authorities of the State, for whatever action they choose to take and claimants should
be informed of the return or referral. Care should be taken to determine the status of the unit; members at the time the
claims incident occurred, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly in civil emergencies as units called by the governor, are sometimes ``federalized'' during the call-up.
If the unit was federalized at the time the claims incident occurred, the claim will be cognizable under subparts C,
D and F or other subparts pertaining to the Active Army.

is reported immediately by the most expeditious means to the area claims office in whose geographic area the incident
occurs or to a claims processing office designated by the area claims office. The report will contain the following
information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Date of incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Place of incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
When required. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An investigation is required as indicated in &sect;536.15 except when claims are regularly paid by local sources.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
By whom made. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Area offices, or claims processing offices designated by them, are responsible for the investigation of claims occurring
within their assigned geographic areas. The state adjutant general will designate an official or office as point
of contact for Army claims personnel and will furnish necessary personnel to conduct or assist in investigations
subject to the availability of funds and personnel. (See &sect;536.7(h). The use of ARNG personnel when available,
is authorized. Attention is directed to &sect;536.19(b) that requires the use of information from other investigations
made previously, particularly military and civilian police reports, reports of survey, line of duty investigations,
and collateral air crash investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conduct of investigation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The investigation will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in accordance with subpart B, except that a sample scope of employment format will be added, together with
a copy of the orders authorizing the performance of duty by the tortfeasor. Also, where a State has waived immunity
or has some other means for paying claims, as through legislative committee or insurance, the claims officer's report
will contain a statement as to the nature of the remedy against the State, the extent of insurance coverage, and the
status of any claim made. If there is no remedy against the State and no insurance coverage, the claims officer's report
will so indicate. If a regular procedure has been established for the processing of claims for a particular jurisdiction
as by agreement between local authorities and an appropriate Army headquarters or USARCS, this requirement is waived.
Finally, inquiry should be made as to any existing or anticipated claim or lawsuit against or by the driver of the ARNG
vehicle or insurer. If a claim or lawsuit has been filed, further inquiry should be made as to probable outcome. This
could be accomplished by discussion with the driver and an examination of the driver's insurance policy, which, if
obtained, should be included in the file.

&sect;536.99 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims in which there is a State source of recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where there is a remedy against the State, as a result of either waiver of sovereign immunity or liability insurance
coverage, the following procedures apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular
procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such procedures should be agreed on by both local authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence
by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commander, USARCS. Such procedures will be designed to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for processing claims, and whenever

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible, and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement for disposition of such claims
as in paragraph (c) of this section is worked out. Amounts recovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other
than claimant's insurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United States) will be deducted from
the amount otherwise payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If there is a remedy against the State or its insurer, the claimant may be advised of that remedy. If the payment by
the State or its insurer does not fully compensate claimant, an additional payment may be made. If liability is clear
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant settles with the State or its insurer for less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum amount recoverable, the difference between the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount recoverable and the settlement normally will be deducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the payment by the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the State or its insurer desires to pay less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their maximum jurisdiction or policy limit on a basis of 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or more of the actual value of the entire claim, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment made by the United States must be made directly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant. This can be accomplished by either having the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States pay the entire claim and have the State or its insurer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimburse its portion to the United States, or by having each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party pay its agreed share directly to the claimant. If the State or its insurer desires to pay less than 50 percent of
the actual value of the claim, the procedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this section will be followed.

(d) If there is a remedy against the State and the State

refuses to make payment, or there is insurance coverage and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant has filed an administrative claim against the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, forward file with Tort Claim memorandum to the Commander, USARCS; include information on the status of any
judicial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative action the claimant has taken against the State or its insurer. The Commander, USARCS will determine
whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant will be required to exhaust his or her remedy against the State or its insurer, or whether the claim against
the United States can be settled without such requirement. If the Commander, USARCS, determines to follow the latter
course of action, he or she will also determine whether an assignment of the claim against the State or its insurer will
be obtained and whether recovery action will be taken. The State or its insurer will be given appropriate notification
in accordance with State law necessary to obtain contribution of indemnification.

Claims against the ARNG tortfeasor individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures set forth in &sect;536.29 are applicable. With respect to claims arising before 29 December 1981,
an ARNG driver acting pursuant to the authorities cited in &sect;536.94(a) is not protected by the provisions of the
Drivers Act (28 U.S.C. 2670(b)); the driver may be sued individually in State court. When this situation occurs, it
should be monitored closely by ARNG authorities. If possible an early determination will be made as to whether any
private insurance of the ARNG tortfeasor is applicable. Where such insurance is applicable and the claim against
the United States is doubtful validity, final actions will be withheld pending resolution of the demand against the
NG tortfeasor. If, in the opinion of the claims approving or settlement authority, such insurance is applicable and
the claim against the United States is payable in full or in a reduced amount, settlement efforts will be made either
together with the insurer or singly by the United States as in &sect;536.99(b). Any settlement will not include amounts
recovered or recoverable as in &sect;536.28. If the insurance is not applicable, settlement or disapproval action
will proceed without further delay.

When claims must be presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim may be settled under this subpart only if presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues, except that if
it accrues in time of war or armed conflict, or if war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and
if good cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after war or armed conflict is terminated. As
used in this paragraph, war or armed conflict is one in which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged. The dates
of commencement and termination of an armed conflict must be established by concurrent resolution of Congress or
by determination of the President.

Where claims must be presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim must be presented to the appropriate Federal agency. Presentment of a written claim to any full time officer
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee of the NG will be considered a receipt. However, the statute of limitations is tolled if a claim is filed with
a State agency, the claim purports to be under the NGCA and it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forwarded to the Army within 6 months, or the claimant makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquiry of the Army concerning the claim within 6 months. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim is received by a DA official who is not a claims approval or settlement authority under this regulation, the claim
will be transmitted without delay to the nearest approval or settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority.

(a) This subpart provides procedures and defines responsibilities for the investigation, processing, and settlement
of claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of a foreign military force or civilian component present in the
United States, or a territory, commonwealth, or possession thereof under the provisions of reciprocal international
agreements, which contain claims settlement provisions applicable to claims arising in the United States, such
as Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Status of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty (DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
appendix L).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The Sending States under current international reciprocal agreements include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal
Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom,
Spain, and SHAPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Reference should be made to DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix L for delineation of what constitutes a foreign military
force, a foreign civilian component, and a foreign dependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Whenever claims arise involving foreign soldiers training or otherwise stationed in the United States pursuant
to bilateral agreements or other arrangements, such as foreign military sales agreements, which contain specific
claims provisions, the claims office receiving the claim will report such claims to the Commander, USARCS, for guidance
as to the resolution and, if necessary, payment of such claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The United States, as a Receiving State, is responsible under some Status of Forces Agreements, for the investigation
of incidents, and for the processing of claims, arising from acts or omissions of members or civilian employees of
an armed force of a sending state present in the United States. The United States may be liable for partial payment of
such claims if they arise incident to the official duties of the sending state's soldier or employee. Article VIII
of the NATO SOFA is the most commonly invoked agreement of this sort. It applies to torts committed within the North
Atlantic Treaty Area, which includes the continental United States and island possessions north of the Tropic of
Cancer (i.e. excludes Puerto Rico, Hawaii and American Samoa). It also applies to claims arising out of acts by military
or civilian personnel, regardless of nationality, who are assigned, attached to, or employed by an international
headquarters established under the provisions of the Protocol on the Status of International Military Headquarters
Set Up Pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty dated August 28, 1952 (e.g. Supreme Allied Command, Atlantic). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Single service responsibility for the processing and settlement of claims cognizable under this section is assigned
to DA by DODD 5515.8. The Secretary of the Army hereby designates the USARCS as the Receiving State Office for claims
cognizable under this section with authority to settle such claims in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2734b. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, appendix L.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) As Sending State forces are considered assimilated into the armed forces of the United States for purposes of the
SOFAs, their members are also barred from being compensated by the United States when they are injured incident to
their service,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for the United States to properly discharge its claims responsibilities under international agreements,
it is essential that the responsible military authorities be notified of all incidents, including off-duty incidents,
in which members of a foreign military force or civilian component are involved. Any installation that learns of an
incident involving a member of a foreign military force or civilian component which results in personal injury, death,
or property damage will notify immediately by the most expeditious means the installation to which such person is
assigned or attached. An information copy of such notification will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS. In the
event the member is not assigned or attached to any installation within the United States, the Commander, USARCS will
be notified. The notification (exempt report, AR 335&hyph;15, para 720) will contain so much of the following information
as is readily available: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Date of incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Place of incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Names and organization of foreign personnel involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Immediate investigation of each incident involving a member of a foreign force or civilian component is required
in order to ensure that all necessary information, including necessary statements and depositions, is obtained
before the foreign personnel involved, either principals or witnesses, depart the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Responsibility for the investigation of an incident rests upon the commander of the installation to which the
member of a foreign force or civilian component is assigned or attached, or if not assigned or attached within the United
States upon the Commander, USARCS. He or she is authorized to designate an appropriate agency of the Armed Services
for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The installation responsible for the investigation will be free to request appropriate assistance from any other
installation within the DOD to the end that a reliable and complete investigation of the incident will be accomplished
most economically. Such requested assistance may be for an investigation of the entire incident, or it may cover only
part of the investigation; for example, it may be a statement from one witness. Normally such requests will be made
of an installation having claims responsibility under the appropriate departmental regulation and nearest the
place of the occurrence. In a case involving an aircraft, such request will normally be made of an installation that
also has the capability of investigating air accidents giving due regard to the type of aircraft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) The investigation will be made in accordance with the regulations of the department of which the installation
is a part. Also, information will be obtained as to whether the claimant is a member of a foreign force or civilian component,
or dependent of such a member or employee. If so, the following will be listed: (1) Any benefits the claimant may be entitled
to from his or her own government whether he or she has applied, or intends to apply, for such benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of any benefits to which the claimant may be entitled, which he or she may have received, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The investigating officer will arrange with the commanding officer of the foreign unit to which a member of a foreign
force or civilian component is assigned, or the immediate superior of such member, to obtain from such member the pertinent
information and required reports. If the member is assigned or attached to a United States organization or installation,
information and reports will be obtained in accordance with the procedure applicable to United States personnel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A claim should be filed with the commanding officer of the United States military installation nearest the place where
the incident occurred, but may be filed at any other such installation, within two years of its accrual. Immediately
upon receipt, a copy will be forwarded to Commander, USARCS. The claim and supporting documents will conform to the
regulations of the department of which the place of filing is a part. Claims filed with a sending State official within
2 years of their accrual will be accepted as timely if received by a U.S. claims office (&sect;536.5) before the passage
of a total of 21/2 years from the date of accrual.

 A claim normally will be processed by the installation that first investigated the incident from which it arose in
accordance with the pertinent departmental regulations. The commanding officer of an installation with which a
claim is filed may by direct communication ascertain whether the incident from which it arose was investigated by
another installation, and, if so, may transmit the claim for further processing to that installation. Upon completion
of investigation, the claim file will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS.

 Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2734b, claims generated by the sending State personnel, while engaged in the performance of
official duties, are settled by a person designated in &sect;536.111 in the manner provided for claims generated
by personnel of the armed forces of the United States, that is, under the MCA (subpart C), the FTCA (subpart D) or the
Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (subpart H). The Commander, USARCS, will obtain scope of employment determinations
from sending State officials under the conditions set forth in Article VIII, NATO SOFA. Payments made are subject
to pro rata reimbursement by the sending State (paragraph 5, Article VIII, NATO SOFA (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix

Scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This section provides guidance on claims against the United States which are based on acts of our soldiers or employees
within the scope of their employment and which arise in countries for which there is an international agreement requiring
a foreign government (i.e., receiving state) to adjudicate and pay the claims subject to partial reimbursement by
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims by foreign inhabitants based on acts of members of our forces which are outside the scope of their official
duties may be payable under the Foreign Claims Act (chapter 10) but are usually not adjudicated by receiving states
under most international agreements. These non-scope claims will be processed under the provisions of subpart J.

Claims procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Claims provisions in Status of Forces Agreements providing for receiving state adjudication have been held to
be the exclusive remedy for claims against the United States, preempting any remedy that would otherwise be available
under other United States claims statutes, such as the Foreign Claims Act or the Public Vessels Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 695 F. Supp. 595 (D.D.C. 1988)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) SOFA provisions for receiving state adjudication of claims against the United States usually refer to claims
by ``third parties'' against members of the force or civilian component. This clearly includes claims by tourists
or business travelers from the United States as well as inhabitants of foreign countries. Depending on how the receiving
state interprets the class of proper claimants under the SOFA claims provisions, the receiving state may also adjudicate
claims by dependents of our forces. Chiefs of command claims services responsible for claims arising in countries
with SOFA or other treaty provisions requiring adjudication of claims against the United States by a receiving state
will ensure their tort claims personnel are aware of the receiving state's policy on the issue of who are proper claimants
under the treaty provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where SOFA provisions provide for receiving state adjudication of claims, the time limit for filing such claims
is often substantially less than the two years that would otherwise be allowed under the FCA or MCA. For example, the
Defense Cost Office in Germany requires that a claim be filed within 90 days of the date it accrues. Command claims services
will ensure that all claims personnel in their area of responsibility: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Receive annual training on the receiving state's claims procedures, to include the applicable time limits, procedures
and location of the appropriate receiving state claims office or agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Screen all new claims and inquiries about claims to identify claimants who must file with the receiving state;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ensure that all such claimants are informed of this requirement and the applicable time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All foreign inhabitants who have claims against the United States which are the responsibility of the receiving
state (i.e., based on acts within scope of duties of employees or members of U.S. forces and not otherwise excluded
by the treaty) will be required to file the claim with the appropriate receiving state office. Those U. S. inhabitants
whose claims would otherwise be cognizable under the Military Claims Act (chapter 3) and who are deemed by the receiving
state to be proper claimants under the SOFA claims provisions must also file with the receiving state. However, if
they fail to do so, their claim may be considered under subpart C, for good cause, with the permission of the Commander,
USARCS. Claims for which a foreign country is responsible under a SOFA or similar agreement will not be paid under subpart
J or subpart C without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS or the senior JA in country (&sect;536.52(a)(3) and
536.152(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A claim filed and adjudicated by a receiving state under a SOFA or other international agreement claims provision
may be considered under other claims provisions of this regulation only if the receiving state denied the claim on
the basis that it was not cognizable under the treaty or agreement provisions. Where a claimant has filed a claim with
a receiving state and received payment, such payment will be the claimant's final and exclusive remedy against the
United States. If the claim is denied on the merits by the receiving state, that action will also be the claimant's final
and conclusive remedy against the United States.

(a) An insurer will be recognized as a claimant under this section to the extent that it has become subrogated by payment
to, or on behalf of, its assured, pursuant to a contract of insurance in force at the time of the incident from which the
claim arose. An insurer and its assured may file a claim either jointly or separately. Joint claims will be asserted
in the names of, and must be signed by, or on behalf of, all parties; payment then will be made jointly. If separate claims
are filed, payment to each party will be limited to the extent of such party's undisputed interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For the purpose of determining authority to settle or compromise a claim, the payable interests of an insurer (or

the amount authorized for administrative settlement or compromise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Limitation of settlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The period of effecting an administrative settlement under the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act is subject
to the same limitation as that for beginning an action under the Suits in Admiralty Act; that is, a 2-year period from
the date the cause of the action accrued. The claimant must have agreed to accept the settlement, and it must be approved
for payment by the Secretary of the Army, or other approval authority, prior to the end of such period. The presentation
of a claim, or its consideration by the DA, neither waives nor extends the 2-year limitation period and the claimant
should be so informed in accordance with paragraph (c), of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the event that an action has been filed in a U.S. district court before the end of the 2-year statutory period,
an administrative settlement may be negotiated by the Commander, USARCS with the claimant, even though the 2-year
period has elapsed since the cause of action accrued, provided the claimant obtains the written consent of the appropriate
office of the Department of Justice charged with the defense of the complaint. Payment may be made upon dismissal of
the complaint.

(c) When a claim under this section, notice of damage, invitation to a damage survey, or other written document indicating
an intention to hold the United States liable is received, the receiving installation, office, or person, will immediately
forward such document to the Commander, USARCS. The USARCS claims office receiving notice of the claim will promptly
advise the claimant or potential claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Where a claim under this section for $25,000 or less is presented to a Corps of Engineers or other designated area
claims office (see &sect;&sect;536.128(c)) and 536.132(c) and thus may be appropriate for action by that office
pursuant to the delegation of authority set forth in &sect;536.128, the receiving Corps of Engineer office will promptly
advise the claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit on the Army's authority to settle
the claim as well as the fact that the claim does not toll the statute of limitations for filing suit. (See &sect;536.21(b).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Claimants are not required to file an administrative claim six months prior to filing suit except for those claims
where maritime jurisdiction is based on the Act Extending the Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction (46 U.S.C. 740)
(i.e. damage or injury on land resulting from an act on navigable waters). However, even in those cases, the filing
of an administrative claim does not toll the two year statutory limit for filing suit nor extend the authority of the
Army to settle a claim. Any such claim filed within six months of the running of the statute of limitations should be
brought to the attention of USARCS immediately and every reasonable effort should be made to complete final agency
action before the running of the two year limit.

Under the provisions of the Limitation of Shipowners' Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. 181&hyph;188, the United States may
be able, in cases alleging injury or loss due to negligent operation of a vessel, to limit our liability to the value
of the vessel after the accident. To take advantage of this law, the United States must file an action in federal district
court within six months of receiving written notice of a claim. Therefore, USARCS must be notified within 10 workdays
of the receipt of any maritime claim arising in the United States or on the high seas out of the operation of an Army vessel,
to include pleasure craft owned by the United States. The Claims Service will coordinate with Litigation Division,
OTJAG or the Chief Counsel, COE and the Department of Justice on whether a limitation of liability action will be filed.

to the statutory limits (presently $500,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) TJAG, TAJAG and the Commander, USARCS or his designee within USARCS are delegated authority to settle ( i.e. deny
or approve payment in full or in part) any claim under this chapter regardless of the amount claimed, provided that
any amount awarded does not exceed $100,000 and that the claimant signs an appropriate settlement agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Chiefs of command claims services, heads of Corps of Engineers area claims offices and heads of other area claims
offices designated by the Commander, USARCS, are delegated authority to deny claims under this chapter presented
in an amount not exceeding $25,000. They may also pay in full or compromise any claim where the amount to be paid does
not exceed $25,000, provided the claimant is willing to accept the payment and executes an appropriate settlement
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Only the authorities designated in paragraph a, above may deny or make a final offer on a claim demanding more than
$25,000. If a claim cannot be settled within the authority of the head of an area claims office or the chief of a command
claims service responsible for investigating a claim, it will be forwarded to USARCS through appropriate channels
with a claims memorandum of opinion recommending disposition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Title 10, United States Code, section 4803, provides for agency settlement or compromise of claims for damage
to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) DA accountable properties of a kind that are within the admiralty jurisdiction of a district court of the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims for damage caused by a vessel or floating object to property under the jurisdiction of the DA or property
for which the DA has assumed an obligation to respond in damages, where the net amount payable to the United States does
not exceed $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Title 10, United States Code, section 4804, provides for the settlement of compromise of claims in any amount for
salvage services (including contract salvage and towage) performed by the DA. Claims for salvage services are based
upon labor costs, per diem rates for the use of salvage vessels and other equipment, and upon repair or replacement
costs of materials and equipment damaged or lost during the salvage operation. The sum claimed is intended to compensate
the United States for operational costs only, reserving, however, the right of the Government to assert a claim on
a salvage bonus basis in accordance with commercial practice, in appropriate cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The United States has three years from the date a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maritime claim accrues under this section to file suit against the responsible parties. The Army's authority to settle
or compromise a suit under this section terminates when the statute of limitations has run. Efforts to compromise
a claim under this section should not extend more than two years past the date the claim accrues unless it is clear that
an administrative settlement is likely. As a general rule, affirmative claims which are likely to be resolved through
litigation should be referred to the Department of Justice within two years of the date the claims accrue.

within the scope of this section will be investigated in accordance with the procedures in subpart B and reported to
the Commander, USARCS. The Commander, USARCS will forward the claim to the Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary
of the Army (Financial Management) as designee of the Secretary or other designee of the Secretary who will then certify

(a) A demand letter may initiate a claim. Formalization of a claim may be accomplished at any time before consummation
of the settlement or compromise. It is preferable that claims under section II of this chapter be submitted on SF 95;
however, the submission of a special form, in view of commercial practice, is not required. The reporting of a maritime
casualty under &sect;536.135 will not be deferred in anticipation of the receipt of a claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims of foreign nationals will be stated in the currency of the country in which the casualty occurred, or in the
currency of the nationality of the claimant if other than the country of the casualty.

Statutory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The authority for this subpart is Article 139, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. 939), which provides for redress for property willfully
damaged or destroyed, or wrongfully taken, by members of the armed forces of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart sets forth the standards to be applied and the procedures to be followed in the processing of claims for
damage, loss, or destruction of property owned by or in the lawful possession of an individual whether civilian or
military, a business, a charity, or a State or local government, where the property was wrongfully taken or willfully
damaged by military members of DA. Claims cognizable under other claims statutes may be processed under this subpart.

Effect of disciplinary action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative action under Article 139 and this subpart is entirely separate and distinct from disciplinary action
taken under other sections of the UCMJ or other administrative actions. Because action under Article 139 and this
chapter requires independent findings on issues other than guilt or innocence, the mere fact that a soldier was convicted
or acquitted of charges is not dispositive of a claim under Article 139.

Claims cognizable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, are limited to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Claims for property willfully damaged. Willful damage is damage which is inflicted intentionally, knowingly,
and purposefully without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from damage caused inadvertently or thoughtlessly
through simple or gross negligence. Damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by riotous, violent, or disorderly
acts, or by acts of depredation, or through conduct showing reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of
others may be considered willful damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims for property wrongfully taken. A wrongful taking is any unauthorized taking or withholding of property,
not involving the breach of a fiduciary or contractual relationship, with the intent to temporarily or permanently
deprive the owner or person lawfully in possession of the property. Damage, loss, or destruction of property through
larceny, forgery, embezzlement fraud, misappropriation, or similar offense may be considered wrongful taking.

Limitations on amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA), or designee, acting on the claim determines that an assessment
against a soldier in excess of $10,000 for a single incident is meritorious, he or she will assess the pay of that soldier
in the amount of $10,000 and forward the claim to the Commander, USARCS with his or her

recommendation as to the additional amount that should be assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A SPCMCA has authority to approve a pay assessment not to exceed $5,000 on a single incident and deny a claim in any

Procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Area claims offices and claims processing offices with approval authority are responsible for publicizing the Article
139 program and maintaining a log for Article 139 claims presented in their areas (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph
10&hyph;6). Area claims offices and claims processing offices with approval authority are required to monitor action
taken on Article 139 claims and ensure that time requirements are met. If assessment action on a particular claim will
be unduly delayed, the office may consider the claim under 31 U.S.C. 3721 and chapter 11 of this regulation if it is otherwise
cognizable under that authority. The office will counsel the claimant to repay any overpayment if the Article 139
claim is later successful (see &sect;516.163(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of a claim and presentment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A claim must be presented by the claimant or his or her authorized agent orally or in writing. The claim must be reduced
to writing, signed, and for a definite sum in U.S. dollars within 10 days after oral presentment. (See &sect;536.20(d)(1)(i))

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action upon receipt of a claim.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any officer receiving a claim will forward it within 2 working days to the SPCMCA over the soldier or soldiers against
whom the claim is made. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of more than one such convening
authority who are under the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim will be forwarded to that general
court-martial convening authority, who will designate one SPCMCA to investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiers
involved. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of more than one SPCMCA at different locations
and not under the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim will be forwarded to the SPCMCA whose
headquarters is closest to the situs of the incident, who will investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiers involved.
If a claim is made against a member of one of the other Military Services, the claim will be forwarded to the commander
of the nearest MACOM of that Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action by the SPCMCA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the claim appears to be cognizable, the SPCMCA will appoint an investigating officer within 4 working days of
receipt of a claim. The investigator will use the procedures of this chapter supplemented by the procedures of AR 15&hyph;6,
chapter 4, applicable to informal investigations. The claims officer of a command, if he or she is a commissioned officer,
may be appointed as the investigating officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the claim is not made against a person who is a member of the armed forces of the United States at the time the claim
is received, or if the claim otherwise does not appear to be cognizable under Article 139, the SPCMCA may refer it for
legal review (see paragraph (e) of this section) within 4 working days of receipt. If, after legal review, the SPCMCA
determines that the claim is not cognizable, he or she may take final action disapproving the claim (see paragraph
(f)) without appointing an investigating officer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action by the investigating officer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The investigating officer will provide notification to the soldier against whom the claim is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the soldier indicates a desire to make voluntary restitution, the investigating officer may, with the convening
authority's concurrence, delay proceedings until the end of the next pay period to accomplish this. If the soldier
makes payment to the claimant's full satisfaction, the claim will be dismissed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) In the absence of full restitution, the investigating officer will determine whether the claim is cognizable
and meritorious under the provisions of Article 139 and this chapter and the amount to be assessed each offender. This
amount will be reduced by any restitution accepted by the claimant from an offender in partial satisfaction. Within
10 working days or such time as the SPCMCA may provide, the investigating officer will make findings and recommendations
and submit these to the SPCMCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the soldier is absent without leave so that he or she cannot be provided with notification, the Article 139 claim
may be processed in the soldier's absence. If an assessment is approved, a copy of the claim and memorandum authorizing
pay assessment will be forwarded by transmittal letter to the servicing finance and accounting office (FAO) for offset
input against the soldier's pay account. In the event the soldier is dropped from the rolls, the servicing FAO will
forward the assessment documents to Commander, Defense Finance and Accounting Services, ATTN: Military Pay Operations,
Indianapolis, Indiana 46249.

(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The SPCMCA will refer the claim to the area claims office or claims processing office servicing his or her command to
review for legal sufficiency and advice. This will be either after completion of the investigating officer's report
or subsequent to the SPCMCA's decision that the claim is clearly not cognizable (&sect;536.143(c)(2)). That office
will furnish within 5 working days or such time as the SPCMCA will provide a written opinion as to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the claim is cognizable under the provisions of Article 139 and this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the findings and recommendations are supported by evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether there has been substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of Article 139, this subpart,
and AR 15&hyph;6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether the claim is clearly not cognizable (see section 536&hyph;143(c)(2)) and final denial action can be taken
without appointing an investigating officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the investigator recommends an assessment more than $5,000, the Judge Advocate/claims attorney will forward
the packet to the head of the area claims office for the legal review. Within 5 working days, the head of the area claims
office will forward the packet, with recommendations, to the GCMCA for approval of an assessment not to exceed $10,000.
If the recommended assessment is over $10,000, the head of the area claims office will then forward the packet to the
Commander, USARCS for final approval of the assessment.

(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After considering the advice of the legal advisor, the approval authority will disapprove or approve the claim in
an amount equal to or less than the amount recommended by the investigating officer up to $10,000. The approval authority
will notify the claimant, and any soldier subject to his or her jurisdiction, of the determination and the right to
request reconsideration. (See &sect;536.144.) A copy of the investigating officer's findings and recommendations
will be enclosed with the notice. The approval authority will then suspend action on the claim for 10 working days pending
receipt of a request for reconsideration unless he or she determines that this delay will result in substantial injustice.
The approval authority will direct the servicing finance officer for the soldier against whom assessments are approved
to withhold such amount from the soldier not to exceed $10,000. (See &sect;536.142(b)). For any soldier not subject
to the approval authority's jurisdiction, the approval authority will forward the claim to that commander who does
exercise special court-martial jurisdiction over the soldier for collection action.

Assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to any limitations provided in appropriate regulations, the servicing finance officer will withhold the
amount directed by the approval authority and pay it to the claimant. The assessment is not subject to appeal and is
conclusive on any finance officer. If the servicing finance officer finds that the required amount cannot be withheld
because he or she does not have custody of the soldier's pay record or because the soldier is in a no pay due status, the
servicing finance officer will promptly notify the approval authority of this in writing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After action on the claim is completed, the claims office servicing the command which took final action will retain
the original claim file and forward a complete copy of the claim file to the SPCMCA. The article 139 claim will be filed
locally, IAW the Modern Army Record Keeping System (MARKS). If a claim for the same incident is filed UP AR 27&hyph;20,
chapter 11, a copy of the article 139 claim will be incorporated into the chapter 11 claim file.

 Title 10, United States Code, section 4837(d), which authorizes the remission and cancellation of indebtedness
of an enlisted person to the United States or its instrumentalities, is not applicable and may not be used to remit and
cancel indebtedness determined as a result of action under Article 139.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although Article 139 does not provide for a right of appeal, either the claimant or a soldier whose pay is assessed may
request the SPCMCA or a successor in command to reconsider the action. A request for reconsideration will be submitted
in writing and will clearly state the factual or legal basis for the relief requested. The SPCMCA may direct that the
matter be reinvestigated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reconsideration by the original SPCMCA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The original SPCMCA may reconsider the action so long as he or she occupies that position, regardless of whether a soldier
whose pay was assessed has been transferred. The original SPCMCA may modify it if he or she determines that the action
was incorrect, subject to paragraph (d) of this section. However, the SPCMCA should only modify the action on the basis
of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reconsideration by a successor in command.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a successor in command may only modify an action on the basis of fraud, substantial
new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake of law apparent on the face of the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal review and action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to modifying the original action, the SPCMCA will have the claims office render a legal opinion and fully explain
the basis for modification as part of the file. If a return of assessed pay is deemed appropriate, the SPCMCA should
request the claimant to return the money, setting forth the basis for the request. There is no authority for repayment
from appropriated funds.

country, or by a foreign country or a political subdivision thereof, against the United States for personal injury
or death or property damages caused outside the United States, its territories, commonwealths, or possessions by
military personnel or civilian employees of the DA, or claims which arise incident to noncombat activities of the
Army.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

When a foreign government has assumed responsibility for settling claims against the United States pursuant to Article
VIII, NATO_SOFA, or other similar treaty or agreement, any claim presented to U.S. authorities will be forwarded
to the appropriate United States sending State Office, or similar office, for referral to the foreign government.
The investigation by U.S. authorities of claims cognizable under a SOFA will normally be limited to securing evidence
from U.S. sources.

(a) A claim normally will be presented in writing. A report of the incident to the authorities stated in &sect;536.149
by the claimant or agent requesting compensation is an adequate presentation. Under unusual circumstances, a claim
presented orally by the claimant to U.S. authorities may be considered acceptable. An oral claim must be reduced to
writing, however, not more than 3 years after the date on which it accrues. The written claim must state the time, place,
and nature of the incident; the nature and extent of damage, loss, or injury; and the amount of compensation claimed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) A claim will be stated in the currency of the country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the incident occurred, or the country where the claimant was an inhabitant at the time of the incident. The U.S.
dollar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of a foreign currency, computed at the time the claim is filed and based on the annual Foreign Currency Fluctuation
Account exchange rate (where applicable), will determine whether a foreign claims commission has monetary jurisdiction
to settle the claim. (See &sect;536.149.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) Claims commissions and command claims service will coordinate informally with the Chief, Special Claims Branch,
USARCS to determine whether it is necessary to comply with the mirror file requirements of &sect;536.21 (c) and (d),
for any claim cognizable under this subpart in which the amount claimed is greater than $50,000 and a foreign government
is not responsible for adjudication under a SOFA or other agreement.

(1) In personal injury or property damage cases, a claimant must have been an inhabitant of a foreign country at the
time of the incident and not otherwise excluded as a claimant. In a wrongful death case, the proper claimants are those
who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitled by the law of the country where the incident occurred to bring a claim for the decedent's death, and the decedent
must have been an inhabitant of a foreign country at the time of the incident and not otherwise excluded as a claimant.
However, it is not necessary that the claimant in personal injury and property damage cases, or the decedent in a death
case, be a citizen of, or have legal domicile in the foreign country, to establish that he or she is an inhabitant thereof.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) A corporation or other organization doing business in a foreign country on a permanent basis may qualify as a proper
claimant although organized under U.S. law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) United States citizens residing overseas may be proper claimants provided it is established that they actually
are inhabitants of a foreign country (see paragraph 7&hyph;4c(1)(a), DA Pam 27&hyph;162) and are not otherwise excluded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) The government of a foreign country and political subdivisions thereof are proper claimants unless waiver provisions
of applicable international agreements exclude such claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claimants excluded.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict with the United
States or of any country allied with such enemy country, is excluded as a claimant, unless the appropriate foreign
claims mission considering the claim or the responsible military commander, determines that the claimant is, and
at the time of the incident was, friendly to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) United States military personnel and civilian employees of the U.S. Government or its agencies and instrumentalities
and their dependents, who are normally residents of the United states and who, at the time of the incident giving rise
to the claim, are residing in a foreign country primarily because of their own or their sponsor's duty or employment
status, are not foreign inhabitants and are excluded from coverage under the Foreign Claims Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Foreign born spouses, children and other dependent family members of such military personnel and United States
employees are also deemed to be inhabitants of the United States and excluded from coverage under this chapter if they
have resided with their sponsor in the United States and are now overseas primarily because of their sponsor's duty
assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Children born to or adopted by a member of the force or civilian component who has not been reassigned to the United
States since the date of the birth or adoption, are deemed to be inhabitants of the United States and excluded from coverage
under this chapter from the time they are born or adopted. However, children born or adopted overseas will be deemed
to be foreign inhabitants if there is clear evidence that they are not a member of the sponsor's household and are not
residing overseas primarily because of the sponsors duty assignment. For example, a child born or adopted overseas
would be deemed to be a foreign inhabitant if the child continued to reside overseas with the other parent after their
military or civilian employee sponsor returns to the United States or is transferred to another foreign country on
permanent change of station orders. (See paragraph 7&hyph;4c, DA Pam 27&hyph;162. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) In the case of a spouse married overseas to a member of the armed forces or a U.S. civilian employee, the spouse
continues to be a foreign inhabitant until he or she moves with the sponsor to another foreign country or to the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Parents or other relatives who are financially dependent on a member of the military or civilian employee, but
are not members of the household, continue to be foreign inhabitants. If they are members of the sponsor's household
they lose foreign inhabitant status once they have resided in the United States or another foreign country with the
sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) Other residents of the United States, or its territories, commonwealths, or possessions who are visiting, touring,
or employed overseas, but not inhabitants of a foreign country, are excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Insurers or other subrogees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Under this subpart the property claim of an insured, but not that of a subrogee, may be considered. This precludes
consideration of the claim of an insurer subrogated by operation of law or the terms of a policy of insurance for payments
made by it to or for its insured. However, an insured party will not be required to exhaust a remedy against an insurer,
which the insured obtained by payment of a premium to that insurer, prior to payment of a property damage claim under
this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Further, no claim or any part thereof, the amount of which has been recovered or is reasonably recoverable from
workmen's compensation, health insurance, social security, or any indemnifying law or indemnity contract, may
be paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) Provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section are intended to preclude any payment that does not go to
and remain with the injured party claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) If the application of paragraph (c)(2) of this section would impose severe hardship upon an individual, the claim
should be forwarded to Commander, USARCS, who is authorized to make exceptions in individual cases upon presentation
of adequate justification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Military personnel of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims based on the negligent or wrongful acts of the following categories of employees will be paid under this
subpart only if the act was within the scope of their employment_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Civilian employees who are not U.S. citizens, who were recruited in the country in which they are employed, and
where the incident occurred. Claims arising from the operation of U.S. Armed Forces vehicles or other equipment by
the employees described in the preceding sentence, however, may be paid, even though the employees are not acting
within the scope of their employment, provided the employer or owner of the vehicle or other equipment would be liable
under local law in the circumstances involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Officers or civilian employees of the American Battle Monuments Commission, acting within the scope of employment.
Claims generated by such personnel will be paid from American Battle Monuments Commission appropriations.

(d) Property for the loss or damage of which claims may be settled under this subpart includes_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Real property used and occupied in connection with training, field exercises, or maneuvers. An allowance may
be made for the use and occupancy of real property arising out of trespass or other tort, even though claimed as rent.
Real estate claims founded upon contracts are processed under the provisions of AR 405&hyph;15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Personal property bailed to the Government under an agreement, express or implied, unless the owner has expressly
assumed the risk of damage or loss.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim may not be allowed under this subpart that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Results from action by an enemy or results directly or indirectly from an act of the armed forces of the United States
in combat, except if it arises from an accident or malfunction incident to the operation of an aircraft of the armed
forces of the United States including its airborne ordnance, indirectly related to combat, and occurring while preparing
for, going to, or returning from a combat mission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Is purely contractual in nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is one for which a foreign country is responsible under Article VIII NATO_SOFA, or other similar treaty or agreement.
(See &sect;536.148). However, if a foreign country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to
consider it under applicable treaty provisions, the senior Army JA in country or, where the estimated value of the
claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander, USARCS, may authorize a foreign claims commission to consider the
claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Arises from private or domestic obligations as distinguished from Government transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Is based solely on compassionate grounds. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;4.)

assigned duties (subpart L). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States incurred incident to service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See &sect;536.25.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C.
8101&hyph;8150). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Is for the personal injury or death of an employee, including nonappropriated fund employees, for whom benefits
are provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901 et. seq.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under workmen's compensation
type laws or regulations, including local law or custom, in cases where contribution is made or insurance premiums
paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee. If, in the opinion of a foreign claims
commission the claim should be considered payable; (e.g. injuries did not result from the normal risk of employment
or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation laws,) the file will be forwarded with recommendations
through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, who may authorize payment of an appropriate award. The Commander,
USARCS, also may specify that all or any part of any compensation received by the claimant from workmen's compensation
sources, as above, will be deducted from the award to claimant. The claim of an insurance carrier subrogee who has received
premiums paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee, however, is not payable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Is for taking of property by technical trespass, such as the overflight of aircraft or a taking contemplated by
the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as distinguished from common law trespass. (See AR 405&hyph;15, para

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Is for reimbursement for medical, hospital, or burial expenses furnished at the expense of the United States.

(o) Is for war trophies, or articles intended directly or indirectly for persons other than the claimant or members
of his or her immediate family such as articles acquired to be disposed of as gifts or for sale to another, voluntarily
bailed to the Army, or for precious jewels and other articles of extraordinary value voluntarily bailed to the DA.
The preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made
for any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation
of DA directives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(p) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property
or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by section 536.152(c)(1). Real estate claims founded
upon contract are generally processed under AR 405&hyph;15. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;46.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(q) Is not in the best interests of the United States or is contrary to public policy, general principles of equity,
or the basic intent of the FCA. Examples are claims by inhabitants of unfriendly countries, claims by or based on injury
or death of individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States, or claims for property losses resulting
directly or indirectly from illegal activities of the claimant, such as drug dealing, black marketing, or illegal
loan sharking. When a claim is considered to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, the issue will
be presented to the Commander, USARCS for determination of the applicability of this exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(r) Arises from the activities of the Panama Canal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(s) Is based upon an act or omission of a member or employee of the Army, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute
or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid. However, this exception should not be used without
prior approval of the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(t) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty
on the part of a Federal agency, or a member or employee of the Army, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.
However, this exception should not be used without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In determining an appropriate award, the law and custom of the country where the incident occurred will be used
to determine what elements of damages are payable and which individuals are entitled to receive compensation. However,
where the claimant is an inhabitant of another foreign country and only temporarily in the country where the incident
occurred, the quantum of certain elements of damages, such as lost wages and future medical care, may be calculated
based on the law and economic conditions in the country of the claimant's permanent residence. Punitive damages and
interest will not be allowed. Court costs, attorney fees, bail, costs of filing a claim, and similar charges also are
not allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Local law or custom pertaining to contributory or comparative negligence and to joint tortfeasors will be applied.

Computation of amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The amount allowed will, to the extent possible, be apportioned among claimants as prescribed by local law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After appropriate compensation for the total damages suffered has been computed, any payment claimant has received
from the tortfeasor, or any joint tortfeasor, will be deducted. This includes amounts collectible from a tortfeasor's
or joint tortfeasor's insurance company or amounts paid by any other third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deductions for insurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Normally there will be deducted from any award the amount of any applicable insurance coverage recovered or an
amount that can be reasonably expected to be recovered and which has been or will be paid to the claimant. In this regard,
every effort will be made to monitor the insurance aspect of the case and encourage direct settlement between the claimant
and the insurer. (See &sect;536.151(c)(1).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When efforts under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are of no avail or it otherwise is determined that an insurance
settlement will not be reasonably available for application to the award, settlement may be accomplished without
making a deduction. In such cases, an assignment of the insured's rights against the insurer will be obtained and,
in appropriate cases, reimbursement action will be instituted against the insurer under applicable procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the reason that an insurance settlement is not available is due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the insurer, no
award will be made until prior consent has been obtained from the Commander, USARCS. In this event, a report on a bankruptcy
will be forwarded without delay setting forth all pertinent information including the alleged reasons for the bankruptcy
and the facts concerning the licensing of the insurer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Settlements will be stated in the appropriate foreign currency. To determine the proper approval authority,
the settlement or the claimed amount (in claims where a settlement cannot be reached) will be converted to the U.S.
dollar equivalent (based on the annual Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account exchange rate, where applicable) on
the date of the commission's action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment will be made in the currency of the country in which the incident occurred or where the claimant resided
at the time of the incident. However, if the claimant resides in another foreign country at the time of payment, payment
in an amount equivalent to that which would have been paid under the preceding sentence may be made in the currency of
that third country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) No more than 20% of the total cost of an award to the United States may be paid as attorney fees or as a fee by any representative.
This fee limitation should be made a part of all settlement agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In appropriate cases, a commission or other approval authority can require a structured settlement with periodic
or deferred payments if it is feasible to make such arrangements in the country where the claimants reside. Such settlements
are especially appropriate on claims of minors. In cases where the time, duration, amount or need for any element of
future damages is uncertain, the part of the award for such damages may be paid into a reversionary trust with the reversion
to the United States.

(a) Claims cognizable under this section will be referred to a foreign claims commission for processing regardless
of the amount claimed. The commander senior Judge Advocate of a command having a command claims service will appoint
necessary foreign claims commissions to action claims arising within his or her geographic area jurisdiction, and
on claims arising in another geographic area jurisdiction that are transferred by agreement between the commanders
involved. The senior Judge Advocate may delegate this authority to commander or chief of the command claims service.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) All other commissions will be appointed by the Commander, USARCS, to act on any claims referred to the commission
regardless of where the claim arose. Commissions appointed by the Commander, USARCS, for units based in CONUS may
act on any claim arising out of the operations of their unit. Any claims commission operating in or adjudicating claims
arising out of an area within the jurisdiction of a command claims service will comply with the legal and procedural
guidance of that service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A commission may operate as an integral part of a command claims service that will determine the cases to be assigned
to it, furnish necessary administrative services, and establish and maintain its records. Where a commission does
not operate as a part of a command claims service, it may operate as a part of the office of a division, corps or higher
command SJA, who will perform the foregoing functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any appointing authority may relieve a commission appointed by him or her. One copy of each order concerning appointment,
relief, or change of responsibility of a commission will be forwarded without delay to the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Normally, the claims commission is responsible for the investigation of all claims referred to it, using the procedures
in subpart B, Investigation, and any local procedures established by the appointing authority or command claims
service responsible for the area in which the claim arose. The chief of a command claims service can request assistance
on claims investigation in their geographical areas from units or organizations other than the claims commission.
The Commander, USARCS can do likewise for any claim referred to a commission appointed under his authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When a foreign claims commission intends to deny a claim, award less than the amount claimed, or recommend an award
less that the amount claimed but in excess of its authority, it will notify the claimant, the claimant's authorized
agent, or the claimant's legal representative, in writing by the means most likely to ensure receipt by the claimant,
of its intended action on the claim and the legal and factual basis for that action. The purpose of this notice is to give
the claimant an opportunity to object to the commission's action and state the reasons for the objection before final
action on the claim. Where the commission intends to award the amount claimed or to recommend to higher authority an
award equal to the amount claimed, this procedure is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This notice should be given at least 30 days prior to final action by the commission, except for small claims processed
under the provisions of subpart B, Small Claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the commission proposes to make a partial award or to recommend a partial award to higher authority, a settlement
agreement should be enclosed with the notice. If the commission is recommending an award in excess of its authority,
the agreement should indicate that the recommendation is contingent upon approval by higher authority. Claimants
will be advised they may either accept the commission's action by returning the signed settlement agreement or, if
they are dissatisfied with the commission's action or recommendation, they may submit a response in writing stating
the factual or legal reasons why they believe the commissions proposed action is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A commission may alter its initial decision based on the claimant's response or proceed with its intended action.
If the claimant's response raises a general policy issue, the commission may request an advisory opinion from the
Commander, USARCS while retaining the claim for final action at its level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Upon completion of its evaluation of the claimant's response, the commission will notify the claimant of its final
decision and advise the claimant that its action is final and conclusive by law (10 U.S.C. 2735), unless the final decision
is a recommendation for payment above its authority. In that case, the commission will forward any response submitted
by the claimant along with the commission's claims memorandum of opinion to the approval authority and will notify
the claimant accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Every reasonable effort should be made to negotiate a mutually agreeable settlement on meritorious claims. When
an agreement can be reached, the notice and response provisions above are not necessary. If the commission recommends
an award in excess of its authority, the settlement agreement should indicate that its recommendation is contingent
upon approval by higher authority.

A foreign claims commission normally will be composed of either one or three members. Alternate members of three-member
commissions may be appointed where circumstances require and be substituted for regular members for specific cases
by order of the appointing authority. The appointing orders will clearly state who is designated the president of
a three-member commission. Two members of a three-member commission will constitute a quorum, and the commission
decision will be determined by majority vote.

A member of a foreign claims commission normally will be either a commissioned officer or a claims attorney. At least
two members of a three-member commission must be JAs or claims attorneys. In exigent circumstances, a qualified non-lawyer
employee of the armed forces may be appointed to a foreign claims commission subject to prior approval by the Commander,
USARCS. Such approval may be granted only upon a showing of the employee's status and qualifications and adequate
justification of the need for such appointment (for example, lack of legally qualified personnel). The commission
will be limited to employees who are citizens of the United States. An officer, claims attorney, or employee of another
armed force will be appointed a member of an Army foreign claims commission only if approved by the Commander, USARCS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) One-member commission. Unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority, a one-member foreign claims
commission that is a JA or a claims attorney may consider and pay appropriate claims presented in any amount provided
a mutually agreed settlement can be reached in an amount not over $15,000 or disapprove any claim presented in an amount
not over $15,000. In no case will the jurisdictional limit of $15,000 be used to unfairly reduce payment of a claim meritorious
in an amount over $15,000. Any other one-member foreign claims commission may consider and pay, in full or in part,
claims presented in an amount not exceeding $2,500 that it considers meritorious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Three-member commission. A three-member commission may take the following actions on a claim properly before
the commission, unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disapprove a claim presented in any amount. Where a claim presented in any amount over $50,000 is disapproved,
the commission, after final action has been taken, will forward to the appointing authority the written notice to
the claimant required by &sect;536.157(f), any response by the claimant and its notice of final action on the claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Approve and pay, in full or in part, a claim filed in any amount which is adjudicated by the commission as meritorious
in an amount not exceeding $50,000. For claims in excess of $50,000 in which the commission approves payment of an award
for $50,000 or less, the commission, after taking final action, will forward to the appointing authority the written
notice to the claimant required by &sect;536.157(f), any response by the claimant and its notice of final action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recommend an award in excess of $50,000. The commission will comply with the notice and comment provisions of &sect;536.157(f),
and forward the claim to the approval authority under cover of a claims memorandum of opinion. Recommendations for
awards in excess of the commissions authority will be sent through any command claims service responsible for the
area in which the claim arose and, in the case of recommendations for awards in excess of $100,000, through the Commander,
USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In any case where no claim exceeds $50,000 but the total amount to be awarded on all claims arising out of the same
incident exceeds $100,000, no action will be taken to make payment until a claims memorandum of opinion (see section
536.22) on the incident has been forwarded and reviewed by the Commander, USARCS or his designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) TJAG, TAJAG and the Commander, USARCS or his designee at USARCS may approve and pay, in whole or in part, any claims
so long as the amount of the award does not exceed $100,000; may disapprove any claims, regardless of either the amount
claimed or the recommendation of the commission forwarding the claim; or, if a claim is forwarded to USARCS for approval
of payment in excess of $50,000, may refer the claim back to the commission or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another commission for further action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Payments in excess of $100,000 will be approved by the Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary of the Army
(Financial Management) as designee of the Secretary or other designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Following approval, where required, and receipt of an agreement by the claimant accepting the specific sum awarded
by the commission, the claim will be processed for payment in the appropriate currency. The first $100,000 of any award
will be paid from Army claims funds. The excess will be reported to the Claims Division, GAO, 441 G Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20548&hyph;9100, together with the documents listed in &sect;536.35(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The chief of an overseas command claims service may delegate to a one-member commission the responsibility for
the receipt, processing, and investigation of any claim, regardless of amount, except those required to be referred
to a receiving state office for adjudication under the provisions of a treaty concerning the status of our forces in
the country where the claim arose. If, after investigation, it appears that action by a three-member commission is
appropriate, the one-member commission should send the claim to the three-member commission with a complete investigation
report to include a discussion of the applicable local law and a recommendation for disposition.

Scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural rules for the administrative settlement
of claims against the United States submitted by the Active Army, ARNG, and USAR personnel, and civilian employees
of DOD and DA for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. This subpart also sets forth procedures
for the administrative recovery from responsible third parties for loss, damage, or destruction of such personal
property. The underlying Act is a gratuitous payment statute; claims thereunder do not sound in tort even though some
tort concepts are used in the adjudication of claims under this subpart. Further, the Act is not designed to make the
United States a total insurer of the personal property of proper claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The maximum amount that may be paid for any loss or damage arising from a single incident is limited by the Act as amended
by Public Law 100&hyph;565, 31 October 1988, to $40,000. The maximum limit of $40,000 is specifically limited to losses
of personal property occurring after 31 October 1988, and to losses resulting from evacuations or from hostile acts
directed against the United States or its officers and employees. A maximum limit of $25,000 is applicable to losses
of personnel property occurring after 28 July 1982 and before 1 November 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any claim within the scope of this subpart, which otherwise would be cognizable under the MCA and subpart C; the
FTCA and subpart E; the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737) and subpart E; the NGCA and subpart F; the Maritime Claims
Settlement Act and subpart H; or the FCA and subpart J will first be considered under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If not payable under this subpart, the claim will be considered under the other chapters prior to any disapproval.
Particular attention should be given to the nature of the claim; many alleged ``unusual occurrences'' are actually
torts, either by employees or by individuals in their private capacities. While some incidents may not seem common
to those experiencing them, an ``unusual occurrence'' is defined as an occurrence beyond the normal risk associated
with day-to-day living and working. An unusual occurrence does not involve a reasonably foreseeable consequence
of normal human activity. For example, having a vehicle hit by a golf ball while driving by a golf course or struck by
an unknown vehicle in a parking lot is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving a vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claim cognizable under this subpart arises from an incident resulting in personal injury, no payment or emergency
partial payment will be made under this chapter until an investigation completed in accordance with &sect;&sect;536.19
and 536.20 has been conducted. The Commander, USARCS, Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, or the chief
of a command claims service may waive this requirement. Prior to payment the investigation must establish that the
incident was not caused by the negligence of the claimant or an agent of the claimant. An example of such an incident
would be a fire in quarters that results in an injury to a soldier's family member and was presumably caused by faulty
wiring, but might have been caused by the claimant's negligence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any claim within the scope of this subpart which is also cognizable under Article 139 will first be considered under
subpart I. If settlement of the Article 139 claim will be unduly protracted, the claim may be settled under this chapter
and the claimant counseled to repay any overpayment if payment is later received under the provisions of subpart I.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any claim cognizable under this subpart that is primarily the result of fault or negligence of a Government contractor
other than a common carrier or warehouse firm will first be referred to the contractor or his or her insurer for settlement
in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;6.

in support of the amount claimed and documents facilitating recovery from a carrier, insurer, or other third party.
Such claims will be forwarded direct to the nearest legal office of the service concerned for settlement. However,
Marine personnel claims should be forwarded directly to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (MHP&hyph;40), Headquarters,
United States Marine Corps, Washington, DC 20380&hyph;0001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Subrogees, assignees, conditional vendors, and similar third parties are not proper claimants under this chapter,
and their claims are barred from payment. Further, claims for losses of subrogees and similar third parties are barred
from consideration or payment under other chapters when the property owner could have presented a cognizable claim
for loss under the provisions of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Personnel who do not fall within one of the categories listed in a above (such as Red Cross employees, foreign military
personnel, United Services Organization personnel, or employees of Government contractors, including technical
representatives) are not proper claimants under this chapter, and their claims are barred.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are nonexclusive examples of categories of damage to or loss of property that may be considered by claims
approval and settlement authorities as having been sustained incident to service. Note that a loss unconnected with
the performance of duty, particularly a loss occurring outside of normal duty hours, would often not be deemed incident
to a civilian employee's service, even though the same loss might be deemed incident to a soldier's service. This is
particularly true if the civilian employee is a local foreign national employee. A claims approval or settlement
authority will ask the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS for an advance opinion prior to adjudicating
a claim that is deemed incident to service but does not fall within one of the following categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Losses in quarters or other authorized places. Damage to or loss of property by fire, flood, hurricane, or other
unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism may be considered, while located at_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Quarters, wherever situated, which are assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Quarters outside the United States, which are occupied authority but are neither assigned to the claimant nor
otherwise provided in kind by the Government. However, a claim is not cognizable when the claimant is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A civilian employee who is a local inhabitant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A U.S. citizen hired as a civilian employee while residing abroad or after moving to a foreign country as part of
the household of a person who is not a proper party claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A family member residing outside the United States while the soldier is stationed in a different country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A local inhabitant of a U.S. territory who is in that territory at the time of a loss when he or she is in the ARNG either
Full Time-National Guard Duty (AGR) or on active duty under title 10, or in the USAR on active duty for any reason. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any place of lodging wherever situated, such as a hotel, motel, guest house, transit billet or other place, when
occupied by claimant while in the performance of temporary duty or similar authorized military assignment of a temporary
nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any warehouse, office, hospital, baggage holding area, or other place authorized or apparently authorized by
the government for the reception or storage of personal property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transportation losses. Damage to or loss of property incident to transportation or storage pursuant to orders
or in connection with travel under orders or in performance of military duty may be considered, if not the result of
a mechanical or structural defect. This includes property in the custody of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A common or contract carrier or any other commercial concern, either pursuant to a Government Bill of Lading (GBL),
Government contract, or the commuted rate method (Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) Vol II, paragraph C8001(4)). With
respect to mobile homes, it is the owner's responsibility to place the mobile home and its tires, tubes, frame, and
other parts in fit condition and to load the mobile home to withstand the stress of normal transportation, at his or
her own expense, prior to shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An agent or agency of the Government, to include property mailed at Government expense in the custody of the U.S.
Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claimant or appropriate personnel while the claimant is traveling in a private or public vessel, vehicle,
aircraft, or other conveyance in performance of military duty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The claimant or appropriate personnel while the claimant is traveling aboard a military vessel, aircraft, or
vehicle in performance of military duty or pursuant to orders authorizing travel, including travel pursuant to leave
orders on a space available basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Losses due to enemy action, evacuation, hostile acts, or public service. Damage to or loss of property may be considered
which is a direct result of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Enemy action, or threat thereof; combat, guerrilla, or other belligerent activities, whether or not the United
States was involved; or unjust confiscation by a foreign power or its nationals of property belonging to soldiers
or U.S. national civilian employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Acts of mob violence, terrorist attacks, or other hostile acts directed against the United States or its officers
and employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Action by the claimant in an attempt to quiet a civil disturbance or alleviate a public disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Efforts by the claimant to save a human life or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Evacuation from a foreign country on the recommendation or order of competent authority. This subsection provides
payment for property belonging to soldiers and civilian employees and their command-sponsored dependents, with
entitlement to shipment at Government expense, which is abandoned during an evacuation and not recovered, or damaged
by an incident of political unrest or hostile act prompting or following such evacuation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Loss of money delivered to a Government agent. Loss of funds neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned
may be considered when the funds were delivered to and accepted by Government personnel authorized or apparently
authorized to receive them for such purposes as safekeeping; deposit in savings deposit program; transmission by
personal transfer account; purchase of U.S. bonds or postal money orders; or conversion into military payment orders,
Government checks, or into another kind of currency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) Vehicle losses. Vehicles are defined to include automobiles, motorcycles, mopeds, utility trailers, camping
trailers, trucks with mounted camper bodies, motor homes, boats, boat trailers, bicycles, and aircraft. Mobile
homes and other property used as dwelling places are not considered vehicles. Damage to or loss of vehicles and property
properly stored or contained therein may be considered when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Used in the performance of military duty, if such use was authorized or directed for the convenience of the Government
and provided_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The travel did not include commuting to or from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent place of duty and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The loss or damage did not arise as a result of a mechanical or structural failure of the vehicle during such usage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Shipped to, from, or between an overseas area or areas at Government expense in accordance with paragraph (b) of
this section, provided the loss or damage did not arise as a result of mechanical or structural failure of the vehicle
during such shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Located at quarters or place of lodging as defined in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, which for
the purposes of this paragraph includes garages, carports, driveways, assigned parking spaces, and lots specifically
provided and used for the purpose of parking at one's quarters, provided that the loss or damage is caused by fire, flood,
hurricane, or other unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism. There is a presumption that vehicle theft or vandalism
occurs off the military installation and is generally not compensable. Claims for theft or vandalism to vehicles
(including property stored inside a vehicle) are only payable when a claimant proves that the theft or vandalism occurred
while the vehicle was located at his or her authorized or assigned quarters (for example, a military police report
indicates broken glass from the window is on the driveway). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Located other than at quarters on a military installation, provided that the loss or damage is caused by fire, flood,
hurricane, or other unusual occurrence. The term ``military installation'' is used broadly to describe any fixed
land area, wherever situated, controlled, and used by military activities or the DOD. A vehicle that is properly on
the installation should be presumed to be incident to the claimant's service unless the application of such a presumption
would be unreasonable under the particular circumstances, such as visiting a fellow soldier on another military
installation while on leave.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Clothing and articles being worn. Damage to or loss of clothing and articles being worn while on a military installation
or in the performance of military duty may be considered, provided such loss was caused by fire, flood, hurricane,
or other unusual occurrence, or by theft. Spilling battery acid, paint or similar substances on clothing, or breaking
eyeglasses during physical training is not an unusual occurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Personal property held as evidence. Deprivation of property held as evidence may be considered when, after taking
all circumstances into consideration, the temporary loss of the property will work a grave hardship on the claimant
who is a victim of a crime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) On-post robberies. Claims for losses due to theft from the person on a military installation by the use of force,
violence, or threat to do bodily harm may be considered. If cognizable under Article 139, the claims should be considered
under subpart I.

Claims not cognizable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are examples of types and categories of property losses for which compensation will not be allowed:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Property lost or damaged as a result of claimant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negligence. Property damaged or lost, in whole or in part, as a result of any negligence or wrongful act of the claimant,
the claimant's spouse or family member, or any agent or employee of the claimant acting in the scope of employment,
is not compensable. Negligence may be defined as failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable and prudent
person would have exercised under the same circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Property damaged or lost while located at quarters within the United States that were occupied by the claimant
but were neither assigned nor otherwise provided in kind by the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Intangible property. Loss of property that has no extrinsic and marketable value but is merely representative
or evidence of value, such as non-negotiable stock certificates, promissory notes, bonds, bills of lading, warehouse
receipts, insurance policies, baggage checks, and bank books, is not compensable. Similarly, a claimant may not
be compensated for the inability to use non-refundable tickets or recover lease or utility deposits. Loss of a thesis,
or other similar item, is compensable only to the extent of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the claimant in
preparing the item such as the cost of the paper or other materials. No compensation is authorized for the time spent
by the claimant in its preparation or for supposed literary value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Incidental expenses and consequential damages. The Act and this chapter authorize payment for loss of or damage
to personal property only. Except as provided in &sect;536.165, consequential damages or other types of loss or incidental
expenses (such as loss of use, interest, carrying charges, cost of lodging or food while awaiting arrival of shipment,
attorney fees, telephone calls, cost of transporting claimant or family members, inconvenience, time spent in preparation
of claim, or cost of insurance premiums) are not compensable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Real property. Damage to real property is not compensable. In determining whether an item is considered to be an
item of personal property, as opposed to real property, normally, any movable item is considered personal property
even if physically joined to the land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Articles acquired or held for sale or disposition by other commercial transactions on more than an occasional
basis, or for use in a private profession or business enterprise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Enemy property or war trophies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) Property acquired, possessed, or transported unlawfully or in violation of local law or competent regulations
or directives. This includes loss or damage to vehicles not properly registered or insured in compliance with local
law or competent regulations or directives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Loss of money in any amount during shipment or storage with baggage or household goods. This includes coin collections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Property stored at a commercial facility for the convenience of the claimant and at his or her expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Substantial fraud. The head of an area claims office may completely deny a claim that he determines to be substantially
tainted by fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Not a proper claimant. See &sect;&sect;536.164 and 536.165(a)(2).

Time prescribed for filing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No claim may be paid under this subpart unless it is presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. A claim
is presented when it is received at a U.S. military establishment, not when it enters the mails. For purposes of this
chapter, a claim accrues at the time of the incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage is
or should have been discovered by the claimant through the exercise of due diligence. In the case of multiple deliveries
on the same Government Bill of Lading, the claim accrues for those later received items when they are delivered. The
claim filed for the initial damage will be amended to reflect the subsequently claimed items. If personal property
remains in storage after the expiration date of legal entitlement to storage at Governmental expense, a claim normally
accrues on such expiration date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a claim accrues in time of war or armed conflict in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged, or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years
after the claim accrues, and if good cause is shown, then the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after the war
or armed conflict is terminated. A claims office may telephonically obtain the authority to grant additional time
to file a claim, from the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division. If good cause for delay in filing is not established,
the intervention of war or armed conflict, in itself, will not permit payment of a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented later than 2 years after accrual. Pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 96&hyph;446 (94 Stat 1967), periods
of captivity are excluded in computing the 2-year statute of limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in non-temporary storage has sustained
partial damage, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the claimant has an opportunity to ascertain
the extent of the loss, or the claimant's entitlement to Government shipment or storage expires, whichever occurs
sooner. However, the claimant is expected to exercise due diligence in attempting to ascertain the extent of the loss.
Moreover, when a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in non-temporary storage at government
expense has sustained complete destruction or loss, the statute of limitations begins to run when this notification
is received.

Form of claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims personnel will date-stamp, log in and consider as a personnel claim any writing received at a U.S. military
establishment if it constitutes a demand for compensation for loss of or damage to personal property. Claims personnel
will not return such writing to the claimant without action as ``lacking documentation'' and may only consider it
abandoned in accordance with &sect;536.234(a). For claims cognizable under this chapter, a demand need not be for
a specified sum of money. However, the claimant must complete and submit DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844 (List of Property
and Claim Analysis Chart) as a condition precedent to payment of the claim. Claimants will be required to complete
only one DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844 and to provide only one copy of supporting documentation. A demand on carrier,
warehouse firm, insurer, or other third party is not considered a claim against the United States. Submission of DD
Form 1840R (Notice of Loss or Damage) to the claims office does not constitute presentment of a claim. If, however,
a claimant alleges that he or she filed a claim, and the evidence shows that within the 2-year period the claimant visited
a claims office of one of the Armed Forces with an apparent desire to obtain compensation, it may be presumed in absence
of evidence to the contrary, that the claimant, in fact, submitted a claim.

Presentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim should, if practicable, be submitted in writing to the claims office serving the Active Army installation
where the claimant is stationed, or nearest to the point where the loss or damage occurred, or where investigation
of the facts and circumstances can most conveniently be made. ARNG and USAR personnel will not file claims with their
unit but with the nearest Active Army installation. If submission in accordance with the foregoing is impracticable
under the circumstances, the claim may be submitted in writing to the commander of any installation or establishment
of the Armed Forces who will forward the claim to the appropriate Army claims office for processing. To constitute
a filing under this regulation, a claim must be presented in writing to an agency of one of the military departments
other than the National Guard or a Reserve Component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The claimant is responsible for substantiating ownership or possession, the fact of loss or damage, and the value
of property, especially for expensive items. The claimant is also responsible for promptly discovering and reporting
loss whenever failure to do so would prejudice either effective investigation of the claim or effective recovery
action from a third party. Failure to do so may result in reduction of the amount allowable or denial of the claim in accordance
with &sect;536.181(a).

Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The prompt, fair disposition of claims of soldiers and civilians, consistent with the protection of the interests
of the Government, is necessary to maintain morale and to prevent financial hardship. Claims approval and settlement
authorities should exercise reasonable discretion in the consideration of claims to achieve this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The small claims procedures (subpart B of this part, small claims) applicable to claims that may be settled by payment
of $1,000 or less without extensive investigation should be used to the maximum extent feasible. When this procedure
is used, every reasonable effort should be made to settle the claim within the shortest possible period, usually one
working day. However, the small claims procedure should not be used when additional investigation is necessary to
develop the facts required for an informed disposition of the claim regardless of the amount claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within the DA, personnel claims will not be transferred except as authorized by the USARCS or a command claims service.
(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When it is necessary to disapprove a claim or to allow a sum less than the amount claimed, the claimant must be informed
either orally or in writing of the factual or legal basis for the decision. The file must reflect that this explanation
was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private insurance coverage, the JA may assume, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary, that the claimant had private insurance covering the entire loss and disapprove
the claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to allowing or recommending the allowance of compensation for the loss, damage, or destruction of property,
the approval or settlement authority will make the following findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The claimant is a proper party claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The evidence substantiates the fact of ownership or possession of the personal property involved and the fact
of loss, damage, or destruction as alleged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The loss, damage, or destruction of the property involved was sustained incident to the claimant's military service
or employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The type of property claimed and the amount or quantity claimed was reasonable or useful under the attendant circumstances
for the claimant to have used or possessed incident to military service or employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) There is no bar to the allowance of compensation for the type of property involved, or for the type of loss, damage,
or destruction providing the basis of the claim.

(f) The claimant certified that no part of the loss is covered by insurance. If private insurance covers any part of
the loss, the claimant must first settle with the insurance company. See &sect;536.181(b)(5). (Coverage under most
personal property insurance carried by service personnel includes items lost or missing, destroyed, or damaged
by water while in custody of a public carrier.)

(a) For claims of losses incident to service processed under this subpart or subpart L, the Commander, USARCS, will
periodically publish an Allowance List_Depreciation Guide specifying rates of depreciation and maximum payments
applicable to categories of property. The Allowance List_Depreciation Guide will be binding on all Army claims personnel.
(See &sect;536.9(f).) For claims for losses incident to service processed under this subpart or subpart L, no payment
will be made on an item or category of items in excess of the maximum payment in effect at the time the claim arose, except
as provided in &sect;536.174(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commander, USARCS will promulgate additional guides, references, and tables to assist in computing allowable
compensation under this chapter. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 2.)

Compensation may be allowed even though the property was not in the actual possession of the claimant at the time of
the damage or loss. Compensation may also be allowed even though the property was not owned by the claimant, provided
it was lawfully under his or her dominion and control. However, compensation will not be allowed for damage or loss
to personal property transported to accommodate another, other than the claimant's family members, nor will compensation
for damage or loss to a vehicle loaned to a claimant be allowed unless both the claimant and the owner are proper party
claimants. A vehicle registered in the name of the claimant or a spouse is not deemed, as between them, to be loaned.
When a vehicle is subject to a lien, the vehicle is not deemed to be loaned merely because the title is in the name of the
lien-holder.

Determination of compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim may be allowed only for the amount and quantity of personal property considered reasonable or useful for
the claimant to have used or possessed under the attendant circumstances, incident to his or her service or employment.
In determining the reasonableness or utility of types and quantities of property included in a claim cognizable under
this chapter, an approval or settlement authority will give consideration to the claimant's living conditions,
family size, social obligations, and need to have more than average quantities, as well as the circumstances attending
acquisition or possession of the property and the manner of damage or loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The maximum amounts allowable for specific types and categories of personal property listed in The Allowance
List_Depreciation Guide constitute a determination of amount of quantity deemed reasonable or useful. A maximum
allowance per item indicates that the allowance for a single item of the type or category of property involved will
not exceed that amount. A maximum allowance per claim indicates that the total allowance for all items of the listed
type or category is limited to that amount. Where both a maximum amount per item and per claim are applicable, the total
allowance for all items will be limited to the maximum per claim, which will reflect the allowance of not more than the
maximum per item for any individual item. To avoid application of these maximum allowances, a soldier or civilian
employee may obtain additional protection on shipments by requesting full replacement protection or increased
value protection. The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS may waive the maximum in a particular
case for good cause shown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Compensation allowable for an item of personal property will not exceed the actual value of the item at the time
of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss, damage, or destruction. Guidance on determining the base figure for actual value, using replacement costs,
estimates, or the Table of Adjusted Dollar Value, is provided in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 2. Because soldiers are
permitted to replace items missing or destroyed during PCS moves from the Overseas Post Exchange Catalog, even when
ordering from this catalog is not otherwise permitted, such items may be valued using this catalog. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In adjusting a base figure to determine actual value, standard yearly rates of depreciation have been established
for the types and categories of items that have generally recognized periods of useful life; standard flat rates of
depreciation have been established for certain kinds of items that decrease in value primarily as the result of the
fact they are no longer new and unused, but which do not continue to depreciate on a yearly basis since they are not subject
to fixed periods of useful life. (See Allowance List_Depreciation Guide.) However, if personal inspection of damaged
property indicates that it was in better than average condition prior to damage, a lesser rate of depreciation should
be applied. Similarly, if the evidence indicates that an item was in poor condition at time of damage, a higher rate
of depreciation is appropriate. Variations from the established rates of depreciation will be fully explained.
The following rules are to be observed in computing the depreciation applicable to any item:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Normally no depreciation is to be charged against goods during periods of storage. However, this does not mean
that deductions cannot be taken for other reasons, such as a reduction in the market value of an item because of changes
in style or obsolescence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do not depreciate an item which is less than six months old (including an item subject to flat rate depreciation)
except clothing and other rapidly depreciating articles which may be subject to considerable use in such a short period
of time. Calculate yearly depreciation from the date an item is originally acquired to either the date of pickup (for
shipment or storage claims), or to the date the property was lost or damaged (for other personnel claims). If the claimant
acquired a used item, then the claimant should use either the date the original owner acquired the item and the original
purchase price, or the claimant's purchase price and date he or she purchased the item. In accordance with the Allowance
List_Depreciation Guide, compute yearly depreciation in 12 month increments (e.g., 6&hyph;17 months equals one
year), excluding the month the property was acquired and the month that the property was picked up, lost or damaged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No item will be depreciated by more than 75 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No depreciation is charged against genuine antiques, objects of art, and collector's items, except for repair
of portions thereof, such as upholstery, which requires periodic replacement or repair. For the purpose of this rule,
a ``souvenir'' is not considered a collector's item. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Compensation normally allowed for an item damaged beyond economic repair is the actual value at the time of destruction.
However, if an item has not been totally destroyed and any part remains useful and has a salvage value, and that part
is to be retained by the claimant, the allowance will be the value at time of destruction less the ascertained value
of the salvageable part. If the claimant does not wish to retain any salvageable part of a destroyed item, he or she may
be allowed the full value at the time of the destruction with no deduction for salvage value, provided the claimant
turns in the salvageable part to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office prior to payment of the claim or holds
the item for turn-in to the carrier (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;44). If the item is turned in to the Defense
Reutilization and Marketing Office, a receipt for the property, DD Form 1348&hyph;1 (DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt
Document), will be included in the file of the paid claim. If the staff or command JA determines that salvageable items
are valued at $25.00 or less, he or she may advise the claimant to dispose of them other than by turn-in and this decision
will be noted on the chronology sheet. In certain situations it may be necessary for the claims office to assist the
claimant to arrange for disposition of the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If, after payment of a claim, an approving or settlement authority discovers that the payment was erroneous because
the claimant misrepresented the quality, quantity, age, condition, or replacement or repair cost of items, or other
facts necessary to the adjudication of the claim, the approval or settlement authority may recalculate the amount
allowed and arrange for recoupment of the erroneous amount paid. However, this procedure should be used sparingly,
with doubts resolved in favor of the claimant. The procedure is independent of any other action taken against the claimant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In determining allowable amounts, cents will be rounded off to the nearest whole dollar on each line item. Drop
amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next dollar. Thus, $1.49 becomes $1.00 and $2.50 becomes $3.00.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to actual value, the cost of obtaining estimates of repair necessary to substantiate amounts claimed
for damaged property may be considered, provided the action of the claimant in contracting for the estimates appears
reasonable under the circumstances or was specifically directed by the approval or settlement authority. However,
when the cost of an estimate can be applied toward the bill due upon completion of repairs, the cost of the estimate will
not be allowed, whether or not the claimant chooses to have the repair done.

 Sales tax and drayage (including postage or handling charges to mail an item or replacement part) can be allowed up

to substantiate that the cost has been incurred.

. Do not pay claims for missing property if the missing property is located before the claim is approved. Only the transit
related damage will be cognizable. As an exception to this rule, compensation may be allowed for necessary items that
were missing for an unreasonable time after the expected arrival date and were replaced by claimant prior to the items
being located. Necessary items are those that are basic to the operation of a household. If compensation is allowed
under the above exception, the claimant will disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in such items in accordance
with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

. If missing property is located after the claim is approved for payment, the claimant will normally be advised of his
or her option to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accept any or all of the items located and remit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount already allowed for such items to the United States. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain circumstances, the claimant will not have an option: The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division,
USARCS or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designee can require the claimant to accept any or all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items and remit the amount allowed; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in the property and retain the amount approved for payment.
If, however, the approval or settlement authority determines that any of the recovered property is substantially
different in quality, price, or value from the property claimed, the approval or settlement authority may require
the claimant to return the amount allowed for such property and accept the property.

Emergency partial payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Frequently a claimant is in immediate need of funds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace damaged or destroyed property. An emergency partial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment up to $2,000 is authorized under the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A hardship situation exists that can be alleviated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing immediate funds for the repair or replacement of certain property lost or damaged; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A claim has been presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The approval or settlement authority determines that the claim is clearly payable under this chapter, in an amount

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the amount of the proposed emergency payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The approval or settlement authority can approve an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency partial payment on any claim that meets the above criteria. If the adjudicated amount exceeds the approval
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement authority's delegated monetary amount, pay up to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegated amount (less the emergency payment), mark the outside of the file ``PRIORITY'' and transfer it with all
documentation (to include computer disk, paper screen and memorandum of opinion) to the next higher claims authority
for additional payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to making any emergency payment, the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approving such payment normally will obtain an executed partial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance agreement from the claimant or his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative. Only the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Division, USARCS or his designee can authorize emergency partial payments above $2,000. The authority requesting
an emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partial payment above $2,000 can coordinate telephonically with

Personnel claims memorandum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A personnel claims memorandum of opinion will be included in the file of each personnel claim disapproved; forwarded
for adjudication, disapproval, or reconsideration; or forwarded with a recommendation that there be a deviation
from the Allowance List or other established policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A personnel claims memorandum of opinion will be signed by the Claims JA. It will be routed through any intervening

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement authority, addressed to the settlement authority who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will take final action (for example, a disapproval would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed to the SJA of an area claims office, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration would be addressed to the Commander, USARCS). The memorandum will be sufficiently detailed to explain
fully and support the action taken or recommended. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;551 for further instructions.)
It will be arranged as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claimant's name and address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Date and place the incident occurred giving rise to the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amount of claim, the date it was filed, and the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration was requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Subparts the claims were considered under, and a brief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of the incident or of the issues raised by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimant on reconsideration.

Reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim will be reconsidered under the conditions listed below. Reconsiderations normally require additional investigation
and review. This additional information will be documented in the file. An approval or settlement authority_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) May always reconsider his or her action if the original action was in error or is incorrect based on new facts. This
may be pursuant to either a claimant's oral request for reconsideration or as a result of any post-settlement review
conducted on the claims file. Note that while the original approving or settlement authority may consider a claimant's
``oral'' request for reconsideration, claims personnel should advise claimants that a higher settlement authority
will not act on an oral request until the claimant presents it in writing in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
The basis for any change will be reflected in the file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Must reconsider a claim upon the written request of the claimant or someone acting on his or her behalf. The claimant
must clearly state the factual or legal basis for relief. However, the reconsideration process must be considered
not as an adversarial process, but rather as an opportunity for the approval or settlement authority to continue a
dialogue with the claimant. Every effort should be made to develop the claimant's version of the facts. A claim will
be reconsidered even if a settlement agreement has been executed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The original approval or settlement authority will modify the original action if he or she determines that the
original action was incorrect or is incorrect based on new evidence. The basis for any change will clearly be reflected
in the file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A successor or higher approval or settlement authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will only modify the original action on the basis of fraud, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial new evidence, mistake (misinterpretation) of law or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, or an error in calculation. The basis for any change will clearly be reflected in the file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An approval or settlement authority can take final action on a request for reconsideration if he or she informs
the claimant in writing that the claimant_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is aware of the right to have the file reviewed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USARCS; and

(ii) Will accept the additional payment as full relief on the claim; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Knows that if the offer is not satisfactory, the check will still be issued (and can be cashed without prejudicing
his or her right to reconsideration); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The file will be forwarded to USARCS for final review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the approval or settlement authority does not grant additional relief, or the claimant does not wish to accept
an additional payment as full relief, or the claimant does not respond by the suspense date, the JA/claims attorney
will issue any offered payment and will forward the claim through any intervening area claims office or command claims
service to USARCS for final action. As an exception, the Commander U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe (USACSEUR), can
take final action on any reconsideration request forwarded there by a subordinate office so long as it does not involve
approving a waiver of a maximum allowance. The Commander, USACSEUR, will include a complete copy of the final action
and will forward the file to the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The approval or settlement authority should consider 60 days from the settlement date a reasonable time to either
submit a written request for reconsideration or provide an intent to file a reconsideration request. The claimant
will receive written notification of this time limit. Any reconsideration where denial is recommended because it
was not timely filed will be forwarded according to paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The Chief, Personnel Claims
and Recovery Division may grant relief on untimely requests for reconsideration on the basis of substantial new evidence,
fraud, mistake of law, or mathematical miscalculation. In appropriate situations, he may deny relief if the filing
delay precluded acquiring additional facts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The JA will ensure that, when a demand on a carrier or other third party (other than a private insurer (see paragraph
(a)(2) of this section) is required (see recovery from third party) and the claimant's failure, absent good cause,
to provide notice or perform other required actions materially prejudices effective recovery action with respect
to all or part of the loss, the amount otherwise allowable under this chapter will be reduced by the amount of the anticipated
recovery so affected on an item-by-item basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to perfect a claim against his or her private insurer, the amount
allowed, absent good cause. the claim will be denied. In determining whether a claimant has good cause for failing
to provide timely notice to a private insurer, the JA will, in addition to the considerations in paragraph (a)(3) of
this section, determine whether the claimant (or agent) had knowledge of the requirement and willfully neglected
to provide notice. See &sect;536.170(f) for cases where a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private
insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Good cause is determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to a carrier, warehouse firm, or private insurer, settlement and
approval authorities may waive reduction action for good cause only when one of the following circumstances directly
contributed to the claimant's failure to give timely notice: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Officially recognized absence (for example TDY and off post training exercises) resulting in claimant's absence
from official duty station for a significant portion of the notice period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Hospitalization of claimant for a significant portion of the notice period; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Substantiated misinformation concerning notice requirements given to the claimant by government personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requests for good cause waivers under circumstances other than those in paragraph (a) of this section may be granted
only by the Commander, USARCS, or designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Prior to taking reduction action, the JA will ensure the claimant is provided an opportunity to explain the circumstances
of his or her failure to take appropriate action, and that the claim file is documented to show the claimant was afforded
this opportunity and the result provided. The chronology sheet in the file will contain an explanation of the JA's
decision regarding reduction or the lack thereof.

(2) Furnish instructions and advice as to the evidence required to substantiate the claim, assist in the completion
of claim forms, and help with the procurement of evidence in support of the loss and the amount claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assure that the description of the items and the damage shown on DD Form 1844 are sufficiently detailed to permit
verification of the purchase price and replacement price or repair cost of the item claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Inform a claimant of the time limits within which a claim must be filed in order to be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Inform all claimants that they must file and settle with their private insurance companies before the JA/claims
attorney will approve a claim for payment under this chapter. Claimants who state they have no insurance will be asked
to certify that fact and the written statement will be included in the claim file. The claimant will be required to submit
proof of final action by the insurer. Claims personnel will examine each claim after an insurance settlement and determine
if prior settlement by the insurer (including excess valuation coverage) is more advantageous to the claimant. A
claims JA/attorney may decide to approve a claim for payment under this subpart without a claimant first settling
with his or her insurance in exceptional cases where an insurance company improperly refuses to pay a claim or the JA
determines the claimant has good cause (see &sect;536.181(a) (2) and (3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Advise a claimant to notify the JA of any offer of settlement or denial of liability by any third party, and to secure
the JA's written consent before executing a release or acceptance of any such offer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Take an active and continuing role in publicizing claims information to soldiers and their families.

 The JA will ensure that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) DD Form 1840R is dispatched to the appropriate third party within 75 days of delivery of goods, that a copy of the
DD Form 1840 and 1840R is dispatched to the destination transportation office, in appropriate cases, and that a signed
and dated copy is maintained and incorporated into any claim filed. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicing transportation office is directed to inspect damaged property in appropriate cases. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;41.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The DD Form 1844 is completed (amount allowed column, remarks column, and where appropriate, either or both columns
for exceptions) prior to settling the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All documents written in a foreign language are translated into English, either verbatim or in summarized form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Unearned freight charges are deducted for property which carriers lose or irreparably damage. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 3&hyph;27.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A claims office representative will periodically attend local transportation office outbound briefings to
ensure that appropriate information is being disseminated to soldiers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Inspections by claims office personnel are conducted in appropriate cases (large claim, reconsideration, fraudulent
claim) and incorporated into the file.

moneys are being properly deposited into the correct account; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On a monthly basis, reconcile expenditure accounts with the servicing FAO to ensure that FAO expenditures match

Duties and responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Field claims approval and settlement authorities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for local implementation of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and will ensure that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Proper notice is provided to third parties (see DA Pam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27162, paragraph 2&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims are processed so that relevant time limitations on pursuing recovery demands are met, particularly the
6-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2415(a). In overseas areas, statute of limitations relevant
to locally procured tenders and contracts will be observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Servicing transportation offices provide supporting documentation and perform necessary inspections in a
timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Claims files include complete, legible documentation needed to support recovery action, including a copy of
the itemized breakdown prepared by the claimant's insurer when appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Third party liability is correctly calculated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, and is reflected on all copies of the DD Form 1844. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written demands for reimbursement are prepared against appropriate third parties, and demands are dispatched
locally or forwarded for centralized recovery within 30 days of settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see &sect;536.196). If this 30-day standard is not met or no demand is prepared because liability will not be pursued,
claims personnel will explain the basis for this on the claims chronology sheet. Note, however, that files will not
be forwarded for centralized recovery prior to the 21st day after settlement in order to afford the claimant an opportunity
to request reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Unearned freight letters are prepared when required by DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27, and are either
included in files forwarded for centralized recovery or are dispatched locally after settlement with the carrier.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Settlement offers from third parties are accepted or rejected within 30 days of receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Checks received are kept in a locked container in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103, and are hand-carried to the servicing
finance and accounting office within 24 hours of acceptance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Claims files for which a third party fails to satisfy its liability are forwarded to USARCS or to contracting officers
for offset as appropriate (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Include demand packets for all claim files forwarded to USARCS due to incidents of bankruptcies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commander, USARCS, is responsible for the general administration of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and
for the Army Centralized Recovery Program. The Commander, USARCS, will ensure that field claims offices comply with
paragraph (a) of this section, and will also ensure that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Demands for reimbursement received for centralized recovery are reviewed for correctness and dispatched within
7 days of receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within 30 days of receipt, checks matched to files are accepted and hand-carried to the servicing finance and accounting
office (within 24 hours of acceptance) or are rejected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Checks which cannot be matched to files are recorded and kept in a locked cabinet in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Unearned freight letters are dispatched after settlement with the carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Offset action, or other collection action as appropriate, is initiated against any carrier or other third party
that fails to satisfy its liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Field claims offices are promptly directed to forward files of bankrupt third parties to USARCS to protect the
Government's interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Records are maintained of non-temporary storage contractors who default on their contractual obligations,
and of incidents that occur in non-temporary storage warehouses, in order to pursue liability as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Chief, U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe, and the Chief, U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service, Korea, will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Assume the responsibilities outlined in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section on claims forwarded
for European or Korean centralized recovery (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;22), except that offset actions
requiring action by DFAS will be forwarded to USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Review each POV shipment file forwarded for recovery action against the European inland carrier for potential
liability within 45 days of receipt. If negotiations with a POV contractor result in an impasse, USACSEUR will arrange
for dispatch of a contracting officer's final decision within 30 days.

The third party is not always held responsible even though a prima facie case is established. The burden of proof will
be on the third party to show that loss or damage was caused by one of the excepted conditions that relieves it of liability.
The following exceptions emphasize or add to conditions stated in the various third party rate tenders:

Carriers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Liability of Through Government Bill of Lading (TGBL) or International Through Government Bill of Lading (ITGBL)
carriers for household goods shipments is as stated on the GBL. The TGBL carrier may be liable for the full depreciated
value of the claim or the current replacement cost of items, without application of depreciation, if the owner purchased
replacement cost protection (RCP), also known as ``full replacement protection''. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph
2&hyph;51.) For the purpose of computing weight, each piece or package shipped constitutes one article. Any article
taken apart or ``knocked down'' for handling constitutes one article. Individual article weights are listed in the
Joint Military_Industry Table of Weights in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, Table G&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Liability of ITGBL carriers for hold baggage shipments (Codes 7, 8, and J) is normally 60 cents per pound times the
gross weight per container (or current contract liability). Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.
(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;11.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Liability of domestic freight carriers of household goods shipments is generally stated to be 10 cents per pound
per article on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. For the purpose of computing weight
under this type of shipment, each packed item (such as a dish) constitutes one item or article. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 3&hyph;15.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Liability of commercial airlines is stated on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-temporary storage (NTS) contractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contract for storage of household goods is the Basic Ordering Agreement, which is governed by DOD 4500.34&hyph;R,
chapter 2&hyph;I. Under this agreement (DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, app H), an NTS contractor is liable for a maximum of $50.00
per inventory line item. (As an exception to this rule, regardless of the way a rank is listed on the inventory, only
one charge of $50.00 can be applied when liability is calculated.) The contractor may be liable to the full extent of
the declared value if the owner purchased an insurance policy from the warehouse firm. No liability can be pursued
against the NTS contractor when goods are given out to a carrier unless an exception sheet was prepared by the carrier
showing any differences as to shortages or overages or the condition of items.The exception sheet must be signed and
dated by a representative of the warehouse to be valid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Packing and containerization contractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A local contractor is liable for loss or damage in the amount of 60 cents per pound (or current contract liability) times
the weight per article as stated in the liability clause of the contract. Each shipping piece or package constitutes
one article. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.

Mobile home carriers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Liability is governed by the applicable rate tariff, rate tender, declared valuation, or personal property government
bill of lading (PPGBL) as stated in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, appendix E, and generally is the full cost of repairs for damage
incurred during transit. In addition to the exclusions listed in paragraph 11&hyph;26, a mobile home carrier is excused
from liability when the carrier has introduced substantial proof that a latent structural defect (one not detectable
during the carrier's preliminary inspection) caused the loss or damage.

 Except for claims involving mobile home carriers, excess valuation or RCP, the liability of any third party is limited
to the least amount of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weight liability or NTS inventory line item maximum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Amount paid by DA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Offers of settlement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An offer of settlement or tender of payment from a third party should be carefully examined giving due regard to all
factors involved. When such consideration shows the offer or tender to be appropriate, it may be accepted. When the
offer or tender does not appear appropriate, further correspondence should be initiated with the third party to clarify
the issues.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DA is not bound by the owner's acceptance of a settlement from a third party where the acceptance was procured through
fraud, duress, collusion, mistake of fact, or misrepresentation. In such circumstances, when a claim is filed, all
correspondence with the third party must be included in the file and further recovery action should be taken where
the prior settlement is inadequate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Handled by one third party only. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where one third party had responsibility for the shipment from pickup to delivery, written exceptions on DD Form 1840
(Notice of Loss or Damage ) is evidence that items in the shipment were lost or damaged when delivered. However, a clear
delivery receipt (DD Form 1840) is only prima facie evidence of a good delivery and may be rebutted by submission of
DD Form 1840R, listing all later discovered loss or damage. The DD Form 1840R must be dispatched within 75 days of delivery;
the date of dispatch is the controlling date. However, the normal 75-day limit for reporting additional damage on
DD Form 1840R may be extended by the claimant's hospitalization or officially recognized absence under the Joint
Military-Industry Agreement on Loss and Damage Rules (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix E, sec II). Implementation dates
for the use of this form and details regarding its use are found in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;4. On claims
for household goods delivered prior to these implementation dates, timely notice is established by exceptions noted
at delivery on DD Form 619&hyph;1 (Statement of Accessorial Services Performed), or on the inventory if dated and
signed by a representative of the third party. Timely notice also includes DD Form 1840, or a letter or other document
noting loss or damage dispatched to the third party within 45 days of delivery.

Handled by two or more third parties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each time custody of the property changes hands, the inventory will be annotated to show any overage, shortage, and
damage found. In the case of pickup by a carrier from a NTS contractor, an exception sheet must be prepared and be acknowledged
by the warehouse firm to reflect any changes in the condition of the goods.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When payment of the statutory limit is made on a claim determined to be meritorious in a greater amount after the application
of individual and category maximum allowances, USARCS will apply amounts recovered from a carrier or contractor
to compensate the claimant to the extent of the difference between the statutory limit and the amount that would have
been paid but for the statutory limit. However, when an insurer has paid any portion of the value of the items involved,
USARCS will apply the procedure in section &sect;536.190(b). Any additional recovery monies available will be paid
out under &sect;536.190(b), if applicable.

USARCS is responsible for pursuing recovery on all claims paid under this subpart that involve payment of the statutory
limit, increased released valuation purchased by the member, replacement cost protection, and/or private insurance.
When forwarding these files to USARCS, the field office should identify them by writing in red on the front upper left

Reimbursement to a claimant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Only USARCS may reimburse claimants on files which are required to be forwarded to USARCS for centralized recovery.
In cases where a JA/claims attorney allowed payment of a claim before settling with private insurance, a command claims
service, area claims office, or claims processing office with approval authority may always make a supplemental
payment to a claimant when the claimant's private insurer paid more on an item than did the Government. If a claimant
has not been fully compensated, he or she can receive a supplemental payment up to the adjudicated value of the claimant's
loss under the following circumstances: (1) When the adjudicated value of the loss on an item exceeds an item or category
maximum and the amount collected exceeds the amount paid on the claim, the claimant will be paid the adjudicated value
to the extent that the amount recovered exceeds the amount paid.

(2) When the adjudicated value of the loss on an item exceeds an item or category maximum and the claimant has purchased
increased valuation protection or other depreciated value coverage, the claimant will be paid up to the amount of
the additional coverage to the extent that this does not exceed the adjudicated value on that item or category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the value of the loss on an item exceeds DA's payment and the claimant has purchased RCP, the claimant will be
paid up to the amount of the additional coverage to the extent that this does not exceed the value determined for that
item.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a claimant has purchased an insurance policy covering the shipment or storage of property and the insurance company
pays any portion of the value of items lost or damaged, the insurance company is entitled, to the extent of its payment,
to reimbursement of a pro rata share of the amount recovered on such items.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a claims office or contracting office determines that recovery or offset against a carrier, contractor or warehouse
was improper, the claims office will forward a request (with appropriate justification) to the Chief, Personnel
Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS, who will authorize a refund as necessary.

Recovery action against a claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claimant is entitled to the benefit of any additional coverage purchased (such as private insurance, excess valuation,
or RCP) on an item-by-item basis as described in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;50. If a claimant is compensated
by a third party on an item and is also compensated by DA pursuant to this subpart, the claimant is entitled to retain
only the portion of the payment that represents the total adjudicated value of the item, without regard to a limitation
on payment due to application of a maximum allowance. If a claimant is compensated twice and the total exceeds the amount
the claimant is entitled to retain, prompt action to recover the excess will be taken in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 2&hyph;55m.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Field claims offices will process to completion recovery actions on all packing and containerization contract shipments

Claims caused by stevedoring contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The ``Liability and Insurance'' clause used in stevedoring and related services contracts provides in pertinent
part that the contractor is liable to the Government for loss or damage to personal property (including POV's), caused
in whole or in part, by his or her negligence or fault and that the amount determined by the contracting officer will
be withheld from payments otherwise due the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims offices processing claims against the Government under this paragraph for loss, damage, or destruction
of personal property of any kind (including POV's) caused in whole or in part by the negligence of a contractor will,
when final recovery action is complete, forward the claim file directly to the Commander, USARCS. Claims offices
processing a claim involving a POV will obtain an affirmative statement from the claimant as to whether settlement
is also being processed directly with the contractor or has already been received from the contractor. Normally,
a settlement with the contractor bars further claim against the Government. (But see &sect;536.186(b).) The procedures
for processing POV recovery actions against stevedores are in &sect;536.195.

Offset actions against NTS contractors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an NTS contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached, the claims office will forward the
file to the Regional Storage Management Office (RSMO) responsible for administering the Basic Ordering Agreements
for storage in that geographic area. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.).

Offset against packing and containerization contractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When any claims office determines that a packing and crating contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot
be made, a copy of the complete claim file will be forwarded by letter to the local contracting office administering
the contract, requesting offset action. The contracting officer will conduct a careful review of the claim file and
will make a determination on the issue of contractual liability on the information contained in the file and on personal
findings of fact in accordance with the contract involved. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Title 4 CFR 102.3(b)(2) affords a carrier or contractor certain procedural rights prior to offset. A JA/claims
attorney will certify to the contracting office that the Army has complied with 4 CFR 102.3 if requested to do so. The
JA/claims attorney will give the carrier/contractor: (1) written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, and
the agency's intention to collect by offset if the debt isn't paid. The DD Form 1843 or demand letter provides this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt if requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the opportunity to obtain review within the agency if the carrier/contractor requests this. If requested, the
JA/claims attorney will review the file prior to offset. No oral hearing is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) the opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt. A carrier/contractor will
normally be allowed 45 days to follow up a settlement offer with a check. If a satisfactory check is not received within
the 45 days, the JA/claims attorney should offset the carrier/contractor without delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In accordance with 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5), the head of an area claims office or claims processing office may effect offset
prior to completion of any or all of the procedures in paragraph d above if failure to promptly offset would substantially
prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt.

of like nature, occurring in post exchanges, bowling lanes, officers and noncommissioned officers open messes,
or other facilities located on land or situated in a building used by an activity of the DA that employs personnel compensated
from nonappropriated funds, should be reported immediately to the officer in charge of the nonappropriated fund
activity concerned. The report should be made by the employee who initially received notice of the incident, regardless
of the fact that the individual involved denies sustaining personal injury or property damage. Upon receipt of the
report of the incident, the officer in charge of the nonappropriated fund activity concerned will transmit the report
to the installation or other appropriate claims officer for investigation.

will be made as to whether the claim is cognizable under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Claim files that relate to claims determined to be cognizable under this section will be marked with the symbol

workmen's compensation coverage under local law for their employees and public liability insurance governing their
operations. If a dispute arises as to whether such insurance is available or applicable, the claim should be forwarded

Non-NAFI RIMP claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RIMP is administered by the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center under the provisions of AR 215&hyph;1.
Non-NAFI RIMP claims are not cognizable under any other provision of this regulation. However, except as otherwise
provided in this section, Non-NAFI RIMP claims are subject to the same requirements that apply to other tort claims.
USARCS carefully monitors all such claims to ensure proper investigation and resolution.

&sect;536.210 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims cognizable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Non-NAFI RIMP claims can arise from the activities of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Members of recreational NAFIs or authorized users of NAF recreational property, while using such property, except
real property, in the manner and for the purposes authorized by DA regulations and the charter, constitution, and
bylaws of the particular NAF activity. This category of persons generally has been limited to members and users of
recreational facilities such as flying clubs organized as NAFIs and craft shops. This category does not include customers
of exchanges, snack bars, motion picture theaters, or similar facilities. Whether a claim based on an act or omission
of a member or authorized user of other types of NAF activities, such as officers' messes, would be cognizable under
this paragraph depends on the facts and circumstances involved, including the degree of participation by the member
or authorized user in the activities of the fund. Claims arising from the use of NAF property, as defined in this paragraph,
are not cognizable under the FTCA or MCA, since the use of such recreational property is by individuals not considered
to be employees of the Army or NAFI acting within the scope of their office or employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Family child care (FCC) providers, authorized members of the provider's household, and approved substitute
providers while care under the FCC program is being provided in the manner prescribed in AR 608&hyph;10, except as
excluded below. Such claims are generally limited to injuries to or death of children receiving care under the FCC
program which are caused by the negligence of such individuals. Claims arising from the transportation of such children
in motor vehicles and claims involving loss or damage of property are not cognizable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although Non-NAFI RIMP claims do not involve employees of the United States, a claim under this section that is
listed in &sect;536.51 of this part is not payable. For example, a soldier injured on a post golf course when hit by a
golf cart operated by an authorized user is barred by the incident-to-service exclusion from recovering under this
section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) A claims approval or settlement authority will ask the Commander, USARCS for an advisory opinion prior to settling
any Non-NAFI RIMP claim where the person whose conduct generated liability does not clearly fall within the above
listed categories. Such authorities may also ask, through the Commander, USARCS, for an advisory opinion from the
U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center prior to settling any claim arising under paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
where it is not clear that the injured or deceased child was receiving care within the scope of the FCC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The total payments for all claims (including derivative claims) arising as a result of injury to or death of any
one person are limited to $500,000 for each incident. Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same or
similar general harmful activity or conditions is treated as one incident for purposes of determining the limit of
liability.

amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and Public Law 101&hyph;552 (15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 1990). The Federal Claims Collection Act states that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agencies will try to collect all claims of the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States for money or property. Among other things, it provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for agencies to recover for damage to Government property.

(2) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651&hyph;53) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(hereinafter ``FMCRA''). The FMCRA provides for the recovery of the reasonable value of medical care furnished by
the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States on account of injury or disease incurred under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances creating tort liability upon some third person. The FMCRA is implemented by Executive Order 11060
and 28 CFR part 43; the Federal Claims Collection Standards (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M) also apply, as appropriate.
However, some procedures appropriate for liquidated debts may not be appropriate for unliquidated claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A JA or claims attorney (designated per &sect;536.6) assigned responsibility for asserting affirmative claims
may be designated as a recovery judge advocate (RJA) or recovery attorney, as appropriate. This designation may be
in addition to or in lieu of designation as a claims JA or claims attorney, depending on the local command needs and available
personnel. When assertion of affirmative claims is a full-time responsibility of an attorney or JA, the table of distribution
and allowances (TDA) position title can also reflect the recovery function.

(1) The chief of a command claims service, an area claims office, or a claims processing office with approval authority
may designate an RJA or recovery attorney for all or part of the area of responsibility assigned to the service or office.
All designations will be in writing. A command claims service may withhold designation authority within its area
of operations or place reasonable restrictions on such designation by subordinate offices through appropriate
command directives.

Purpose and policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes procedures for the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement,
and waiver of claims in favor of the United States for damage to, loss, or destruction of Army property, and for the recovery
of the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished by the United States, under the statutes cited
in &sect;536.213. Sound governmental policy in the collection of claims of the United States for money or property
requires aggressive agency collection action. Responsible officials within DA will ensure that personnel asserting
claims are properly trained and supported to take timely and effective action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The chapter does not apply to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims between Federal agencies. If such a claim cannot be resolved by negotiation, it should be referred to GAO.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Maritime claims under subpart H. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Affirmative actions for nonmonetary relief (for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evictions, specific performance, and injunctive relief). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Claims arising out of tax aspects of a contract, or other transaction or activity involving either nonappropriated
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriated funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The senior Judge Advocate of a command having a command claims service, or the commander, USACSEUR, will prescribe
procedures for implementing single service claims responsibility under DODD 5155.8 and for implementing any provision
in a treaty or international agreement that limits or provides special methods for asserting claims in favor of the
U.S. With the concurrence of the Commander, USARCS, the senior JA of a command having a command claims service, or the
commander, USACSEUR, is authorized to modify the procedures in this chapter to accommodate special circumstances.
The SJA will provide the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, with a copy of all published guidance.

(c) Unless authority is withheld by the Commander, USARCS or the chief of a command claims service, the head of an area
claims office may: (1) compromise up to $25,000 of the amount asserted on a property damage or medical care claim asserted
for $40,000 or less (see &sect;536.229(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Terminate collection action on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $25,000 or less when further
collection efforts are not feasible (see paragraph 14&hyph;19c); or waive a medical care claim asserted for $25,000
or less when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection in any amount will result in undue hardship to the injured party (see &sect;536.229(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The head of an area claims office may delegate authority to a claims processing office to: (1) compromise up to $20,000
of the amount asserted on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $40,000 or less (see &sect;536.229(d)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Terminate collection action on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $20,000 or less when further
collection efforts are not feasible (see paragraph 14&hyph;19c); or waive a medical care claim asserted for $20,000
or less when collection in any amount will result in undue hardship to the injured party (see &sect;536.229(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The head of an area claims office or a claims processing office, or the chief of a command claims service, may redelegate
up to $20,000 of his or her authority to an RJA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In determining whether a settlement authority has authority to compromise, terminate, or waive a claim, consider
the medical costs for all parties injured in a single incident as a single assertion; and consider the total value of
Government property damaged or destroyed in a single incident as a single assertion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Only the Department of Justice (DOJ) may approve claims involving: (1) Compromise, termination, or waiver of
a medical care or property damage claim asserted for more than $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Settlement actions previously referred to DOJ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) Settlement where a third party has filed suit against the United States or the injured party for the same incident
which gave rise to the claim of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The commander, USARCS, or the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, in consultation with the Department
of Justice, will approve all claims involving unusual circumstances, a new point of law which may serve as a precedent,
or a question of policy.

(a) The Federal Claims Collection Standards. The Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104, reprinted
in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M), prescribe standards for compromising and litigating property damage claims,
and provide general guidance for compromising and litigating medical care claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Property damage claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Claims asserted under the Federal Claims Collection Act for damage to Government property are founded in tort and
must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Medical care claims asserted under the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Claims asserted under the FMCRA or against an automobile liability insurer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 are also founded in
tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). Although no court
has ruled on this issue, claims asserted under 10 U.S.C. 1095 against a no-fault or PIP insurer are presumably founded
in a contract ``implied in law''; if so, they must be brought within six years (28 U.S.C. 2415a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computing the statute of limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Normally, a medical care claim ``first accrues'' on the initial date of treatment, and a property damage claim accrues
on the date that the property was damaged. However, in computing the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2416(c) excludes
the period of time before a U.S. official charged with the responsibility to act in the circumstances knows or should
know that there is a basis for a claim. See

medical care claims paid by CHAMPUS at least until the date on which CHAMPUS received the bill from the provider.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Medical care claims asserted under state law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Claims asserted against an insurer on a third party beneficiary theory or against a state workers' compensation fund
must be brought within the applicable state statute of limitations which can range from one to six years. Normally,
the statute of limitations would begin to run when the injury occurred, rather than the date of initial treatment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicable law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Federal law does not define what constitutes a tort. Unless the RJA can properly apply the law of another jurisdiction
under conflict of law rules, the RJA will apply the law of the state or country where an incident occurred in determining
whether the Government has a cause of action founded in tort.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concurrent claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Claims for damage to Army property and claims for medical care arising from the same incident will be processed
under the section applicable to each. However, efforts should be made to include all medical care and property damage
claims in a single demand against a third party or insurance company. Settlement agreements will be drafted so that
settlement and release of one claim shall not prejudice settlement of the remaining claim.

(2) If the incident giving rise to a claim in favor of the United States also gives rise to a potential claim against the

authority who has jurisdiction to take final action on the claim against the Government.

U.S. Government agencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RJAs will not assert a claim against any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States. A self-insured

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The report of survey system (chapter 13, AR 735&hyph;5) is the primary mechanism for collecting from a civilian employee
or a soldier (including an AR or NG soldier) for damage to government property. Report of survey procedures should
normally be used whenever applicable. AR 735&hyph;5 requires claims offices to assert property damage claims against
soldiers and employees in two instances: (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Damage caused by POV's.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to paragraph 14&hyph;30, AR 735&hyph;5, if a report of survey approving authority assesses liability against
a soldier or civilian employee for negligently damaging Government property using a POV, and the soldier or employee
does not make restitution, the approving authority will forward the approved report of survey to the claims office.
The RJA will assert a demand against the soldier or employee's liability insurance for the full value of the damage.
If the soldier or employee does not have insurance, the RJA will return the action for the approving authority to withhold
a month's pay from the soldier or employee.

the F&amp;AO may refer the action to the servicing claims office for recovery action under the Federal Claims Collection

 An RJA will not assert a claim based on a tort liability theory against a tortfeasor who is a soldier, family member or
retiree for the tortfeasor's own medical care; a person cannot create tort liability by injuring himself or herself.
In such instances, however, the RJA may assert a claim under 10 U.S.C. 1095 against the injured tortfeasor's personal
injury protection (PIP) or medical payments insurance coverage.

 An RJA may assert a medical care claim against a soldier, civilian employee, family member or retiree without insurance

be granted if there are aggravating circumstances, such as willful misconduct, and the tortfeasor has sufficient
assets to satisfy both the injured victim and the Government's claim.

 Some contracts have ``cost-plus'' or reimbursement provisions which require the government to reimburse the contractor
for many types of expenses. If it appears that the contract would require the government to reimburse a contractor
for money recovered on an otherwise meritorious affirmative claim, the RJA will investigate the claim and forward
a recommendation to USARCS, referencing the specific contract clauses involved. The RJA will assert other claims
against government contractors after verifying that the contract does not contain a reimbursement provision.

(a) Other regulations establish systems of property accountability and responsibility; and provide for the administrative
collection of charges from military and civilian personnel of the United States, and other individuals and legal
entities from whom collection may be made without litigation. However, when the investigation results in a preliminary

The RJA will ensure that installation motor pools, housing and engineering staff sections, unit property custodians,
and similar persons apprise the claims office of damage to DA property. In addition, claims personnel will review
MP blotters and reports, civilian news sources, reports of survey, magistrate court proceedings, line of duty and
AR 15&hyph;6 investigations, and similar reports to identify additional property damage cases. A claims office
designated as the NG point of contact for a state will coordinate with NG officials to ensure that NG units appoint unit

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims personnel will investigate potential incidents, question witnesses to determine the facts and circumstances,
and identify all available insurance coverage. Claims personnel may directly request assistance from other DOD
claims offices. Claims personnel may also request an investigation of an incident by a unit claims officer for the
unit or organization responsible for the damaged or destroyed property, or, when the investigation may be more practically
conducted by the claims officer of some other unit or organization, by another unit claims officer. If no other report
has been prepared, the unit claims officer will prepare DA Form 1208. Claims personnel will obtain a breakdown of costs
from the custodian of the property.

If the RJA determines that there is no tort liability or that the potential recovery is too small to be worth pursuing,

If there is a legal and factual basis for the Government to recover, claims personnel should notify both the tortfeasor
and the tortfeasor's insurer. The assertion letter should outline the facts and cite the Federal Claims Collection
Act as the basis for recovery. The claims office may also cite local law. The claims office should assert the claim for
the full costs to the Government, if known, or state that the costs are still being ascertained. Where appropriate,
the assertion letter should also provide the option to repair the damaged property or to replace it in kind.

(a) Army claims offices assert claims against tortfeasors and insurers for medical and dental care which is furnished
to a soldier, family member or retiree at Army expense to treat an injury or disease resulting from tortious conduct.
In states that have modified traditional tort liability, Army claims offices also assert claims against insurers
other than health benefits insurers, such as no-fault and medical payments automobile insurers, and workers' compensation
funds. In doing so, claims offices coordinate their efforts with the injured party's efforts to recover other damages
from tortfeasors and insurers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims offices will forward potential claims for medical care furnished to service members, family members or
retirees of Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard to the nearest installation or office of that service. As an
exception to this rule, however, claims offices may assert and collect claims for medical care provided to retirees
of another service and their dependents if:

(1) Medical care was furnished at the local Army MTF; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the incident giving rise to the claim occurred near the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Army installation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the retiree resides near the Army installation. In these exceptional situations, the claims office must ensure
that the retiree is not receiving care at another service's MTF. The claims office must also notify USARCS as well as
the nearest installation or office of the retiree's service that it is handling the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In some instances, the Army and the VA will both pay for care provided to a soldier or retiree. The VA, however, is
precluded from asserting claims for ``service-connected'' injuries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) If a soldier is injured and is discharged from the service, the claims office will assert claims for the reasonable
value of medical care furnished at Army expense (including care furnished in a VA facility) prior to a soldier's discharge.
Claims offices will not assert for the value of medical care furnished at VA expense, but the RJA will consider future
care provided by VA in determining whether to approve a waiver or compromise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a retiree is injured and receives some care paid for by the Army and other care in a VA facility, the claims office
will coordinate with the nearest VA office and assert a claim for the full value of the care provided. The office will
remit the amount recovered for care provided at VA expense to the VA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pursuant to the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act the Government may pursue recovery of medical costs under any of
the following tactics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Subrogation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States is subrogated to any rights or claims held by a person to whom the Government has provided medical
care against the tortfeasor who caused him or her to be injured. As subrogee, the United States can recover from the
wrongdoer the reasonable value of the medical care it has furnished or will furnish the injured party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intervention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The MTF commander will ensure that the claims office is notified of instances where the MTF provides or is billed
by a civilian facility for inpatient or outpatient care resulting from injuries such as broken bones or burns arising
from automobile accidents, gas explosions, falls, civilian malpractice, and similar incidents which do not involve
collections from a health benefits or medicare supplemental insurer. Claims personnel will coordinate with MTF
personnel to ensure that inpatient and outpatient records, and emergency room and clinic logs are properly screened
to identify potential cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The MTF commander will also ensure that the MTF does not release billings or medical records, or respond to requests
for assistance with worker's compensation forms, without coordinating with the RJA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
By CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary is required to identify and to promptly mail claims involving certain diagnostic
codes to the claims office designated as the state point of contact. The fiscal intermediary is required to provide
the contact office with a personal injury questionnaire completed by the injured party and a copy of the CHAMPUS Explanation
of Benefits showing the amount that CHAMPUS paid on the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In accordance with chapter 5 of the CHAMPUS Fiscal Intermediary Operations Manual (September 1991), a fiscal
intermediary must suspend payment on a claim with possible medical care recovery until the injured party properly
completes the personal injury questionnaire. Within 15 working days after receiving and evaluating the completed
questionnaire, the fiscal intermediary is required to dispatch possible medical care recovery cases to the appropriate
claims office. The contact office must work with the fiscal intermediary to ensure that claims are properly identified
and forwarded in a timely manner. The claims office should document persistent problems and notify USARCS.

The RJA will ensure that MTF comptroller, clinic, and Patient Administration Division records are screened to identify
potential medical care recovery cases. The RJA will also coordinate with Navy and Air Force claims offices and MTFs
to ensure that they identify potential claims involving treatment provided to Army personnel. To the extent possible
claims personnel will review civilian police reports, military police blotters and reports, news reports, magistrate
court proceedings, line of duty and AR 15&hyph;6 investigations, and similar sources to identify other potential
medical care recovery claims.

Unless it is obvious from the notification documents that there is no potential recovery, claims personnel will open

(1) Several claims offices may be notified of incidents involving more than one injured party or treatment at more
than one facility. If an RJA has reason to believe that this has occurred, the RJA will contact the other offices to determine
which office has the most significant contacts and should assert the claim. The office closest to where the injury
occurred is not necessarily the office with the most significant contacts. In the event that offices cannot agree,
they will refer the matter to the Chief, Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS for a decision. The claims office will notify
the MTF if it transfers responsibility for a claim that the MTF referred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If MTF personnel have not already collected the necessary information, claims personnel will dispatch questionnaires
to injured parties to determine the facts and circumstances and identify all available insurance coverage. Claims
personnel will obtain medical records and billings to determine the value of the Government's claim, and will contact
witnesses and consult with medical personnel as appropriate. RJAs may direct unit claims officers to investigate
incidents and may request assistance from other DOD claims offices as needed.

If the RJA determines that there is no tort liability or possible recovery from an insurer or workers' compensation
fund, or that the potential recovery is too small to be worth pursuing, he or she will dispose of the notification without
asserting a claim. If a potential claim file was opened, claims personnel will annotate the basis for closing the potential

If there is a legal and factual basis for the Government to recover, claims personnel will assert a demand against each

right to recover even if the injured party's attorney enters into a representation agreement (see &sect;536.226(b)).

If the claims office can recover from the tortfeasor's automobile liability and from the injured party's non-liability
coverage, the claims office should put both insurers on notice of the claim and should first attempt to collect from
the no-fault insurer. If the tortfeasor is an uninsured motorist and the injured party has uninsured/underinsured
motorists' coverage, the claims office should attempt to recover from the injured party's insurer while following
the procedures in &sect;536.228(a). See &sect;536.227(e) if the injured party has health benefits insurance.

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(1) and 1086(g), workers' compensation and the injured party's no-fault, PIP, medical
payments, and uninsured/underinsured motorist's coverage are considered ``primary'' to CHAMPUS. Before the fiscal
intermediary pays the injured party's medical bills and notifies the claims office to assert a claim against the tortfeasor,
the fiscal intermediary is required to verify that these ``primary payers'' have paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the fiscal intermediary overlooks such coverage, the claims office will immediately assert a demand against
the injured party's insurer (or the workers' compensation fund) citing 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(1) in addition to other
sources of authority. If the insurer has already disbursed the policy limits to the injured party, the claims office
will request repayment from the injured party. The claims office will return money recovered in this manner to CHAMPUS
(see &sect;536.231(d)(3)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recovery for MTF care is presently based upon multiple ``clinical group'' per diem inpatient rates and a single per
visit outpatient rate established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Claims personnel should obtain a
billing from each MTF. The RJA should, however, obtain information from the MTF registrar and adjust the amount asserted
if it appears that the billings include inpatient days where the injured party was retained in the MTF for administrative
purposes rather than medical needs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CHAMPUS costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recovery for inpatient care provided in civilian hospitals and paid through CHAMPUS is based upon the CHAMPUS ``Diagnosis
Related Group'' (DRG) rates, regardless of the ``actual'' costs. Rates for outpatient care are based on the CHAMPUS
``allowable charge'' for that medical service. Claims offices should assert for the amount that CHAMPUS paid even
though this can sometimes exceed the amount that the civilian hospital billed.

Ambulance services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ambulance and air ambulance services provided to soldiers, family members and retirees are ``medical costs'' within
the meaning of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095, but they are not included in the OMB rates. Claims offices should try to obtain
a specific breakdown of costs from the MTF or the unit providing the services and include these in the amount asserted.

Burial expenses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a soldier dies from injuries received and is buried at Government expense, the installation Mortuary Affairs Office
completes DD Form 2063 and itemizes expense data on this form. While burial expenses are not ``medical care'' within
the meaning of the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095, many insurance policies provide for the payment of such expenses. Claims
offices may assert a demand for burial expenses incurred by the Government if the insurance contract provides for
payment of such expenses and state law recognizes the United States as a third party beneficiary of the contract. Claims
personnel should, however, be extra sensitive to the possibility that the insurance proceeds might be inadequate
and should consider waiving or compromising the Government's claim in appropriate cases to avoid undue hardship
to the deceased injured party's next of kin.

Relations with the injured party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Claims personnel will advise the injured party and/or his attorney that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The United States has a right to recover the reasonable value of medical care that has been furnished or will be furnished
in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The injured party is required to cooperate with the United States by providing a complete statement of the facts
and circumstances surrounding the injury, information about any legal action brought against any prospective defendant,
and information about and copies of any insurance policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The injured party should not execute a release or settle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any claims without notifying the RJA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The injured party may consult with a legal assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attorney if he or she is otherwise entitled to legal assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims personnel should attempt to coordinate action to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect the claim of the United States with the injured party's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to collect his or her own claim against a tortfeasor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The RJA may enter into a written agreement with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injured party's attorney to assert the Government's claim and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include it as an item of special damages if the injured party sues. The agreement must state that the Government will
not pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counsel fees, and that the attorney will not compute his fee based on the Government's portion of any recovery. The
agreement must also state that the Government must be consulted regarding any potential compromise and must agree
to any settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The RJA should coordinate with the injured party's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attorney to ensure that any request for compromise or waiver of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Government's claim is considered as far in advance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement as is practical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The RJA may arrange to make local witnesses available for the injured party's attorney. With approval from USARCS,
the RJA may arrange to make other Army witnesses available for the injured party's attorney if it is in the Government's
best interests to do so. Any such request must be submitted as far in advance as practical. The appearance of present
and former DA military and civilian personnel as witnesses is governed by AR 27&hyph;40, chapter 7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The RJA should immediately terminate a representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement and independently pursue the Government's right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover if the injured party's interests conflict with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government's interests, or if the injured party's attorney fails 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to keep the RJA informed of developments or otherwise acts in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner inconsistent with representing the Government's interest.

(c) If the injured party or his attorney fails to cooperate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the claims office, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel to withhold billing information and should vigorously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue the Government's right to recover. In addition, as outlined in 32 CFR 537.23, the RJA is authorized to direct
the MTF to withhold release of medical records until the injured party provides the statement and other information
required by &sect;536.226(a)(2); the RJA may not, however, direct the MTF to withhold medical records if the injured
party's attorney merely refuses to enter into a representation agreement. In appropriate cases, the claims office
should intervene in pending litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the injured party's attorney improperly withholds or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disburses money collected on behalf of the Government, the RJA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should immediately initiate action to recover the money owed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through litigation or through State disciplinary proceedings after appropriate coordination in accordance with
AR 27&hyph;40 and AR 27&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Claims personnel may obtain an assignment from the injured party or his attorney for the reasonable value of the
care that the United States provided if this will facilitate collection. The absence of an assignment does not affect
the Government's independent right under the FMCRA, however, and an assignment is normally not necessary.

(a) As provided in the MOA, claims offices will recover from automobile insurers, while MTFs will recover from health
benefits and medicare supplemental insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As provided in the MOA, MTFs will obtain insurance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other relevant information from persons receiving inpatient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outpatient treatment for injuries resulting from an accident. MTF personnel will also screen emergency room logs,
clinic records, and patient admission information to identify accident cases. MTFs will refer these cases to claims
offices in a timely manner, assist claims offices in obtaining medical records and cost computations, and route requests
for medical records from injured parties and attorneys through the RJA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In return, claims offices will notify the MTFs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final disposition of cases referred, deposit money recovered under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to the operations and maintenance
account of the MTF that provided the care (see &sect;536.231(d)), and report the amounts deposited to an MTF's account
on a monthly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As provided in the MOA, the head of each claims office may enter into a local Memorandum of Agreement with his or her

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting Army MTF commander. Such agreements should cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, the degree of staffing each office will provide, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frames for providing records or information. Such agreements may also provide for the MTF to assist the claims
office's medical care recovery effort, either by giving back money deposited by the claims office into the MTF's Operations
&amp; Maintenance fund to the claims office, or by providing personnel or other support. Any personnel provided or
money returned to the claims office under such an agreement will only be used to support affirmative claims collection
efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If care was wholly or partly provided in an MTF on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after 5 November 1990 and recovery is possible from both a health

benefits insurer and an automobile insurer, the MTF will first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempt to collect from the health insurer. If the MTF cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover the full value of the Government's claim from the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurer, the MTF will forward the claim file to the installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the RJA will forward a completed worksheet to the area claims office (if that office has authority to take action) or
to USARCS as appropriate. When time is of the essence in securing a settlement, an RJA may contact USARCS telephonically
for authorization to waive or compromise a claim. Prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the RJA should
contact USARCS for guidance on disposing of any claim which cannot be recovered in full, compromised, terminated
or litigated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payment in full.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A settlement authority may settle a medical care or property damage claim by recovering the full amount the Government's
claim as a lump sum, through installment payments, or as a repair in kind on a property damage claim. An offer for the
full amount of available insurance would not ``pay in full'' a claim asserted for a greater amount, and the RJA would
have to follow compromise procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compromise.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If there are difficulties in recovering on a medical care or property damage claim (as defined by part 103 of the
Federal Claims Collection Standards), a settlement authority may accept less than the amount asserted from a tortfeasor
or insurer for the convenience of the government. Acceptable bases for compromise for the convenience of the government
include inability of the tortfeasor to pay, insufficient insurance, probability that the government will be unable
to prove its case, or collection costs which are not commensurate with the amount being compromised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the injured party or the injured party's attorney requests waiver or compromise of a medical care claim, a settlement
authority may accept an amount less than the amount asserted to equitably apportion the available funds and avoid
undue hardship to the injured party. To do so, the settlement authority must consider the fair value of the injured
party's claim, the future value of care provided by the United States, and the potential recovery available. In evaluating
a request, the settlement authority may consider an offer by the injured party's attorney to reduce his or her fee,
but should not make this a condition for granting a request. Prior to approval of any compromise based on undue hardship,
the injured party must provide the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Detailed information on what funds are available for recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reasonable value of the injured party's claim for permanent injury, pain and suffering, decreased earning power,
and any other items of special damages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Military, VA, and Social Security disability, and any other Government benefits accruing to the injured party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Probability and amount of future medical expenses of the Government and the injured party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Present and prospective assets, income, and obligations of the injured party and those dependent on him or her.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A statement regarding the financial condition of the debtor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Termination of collection action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If there are difficulties in recovering on a medical care or property damage claim (as defined by 4 CFR part 104.3 of
the Federal Claims Collection Standards), a settlement authority may close the claim without recovery for the convenience
of the Government. Acceptable bases for terminating collection action include lack of legal merit to the claim, lack
of evidence to substantiate the claim, costs of recovery which will exceed the amount recoverable, or inability to
locate the debtor in instances where the likelihood of collection is too remote to justify retention of the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the injured party or the injured party's attorney requests waiver or compromise of the government's claim, a settlement
authority may close a medical care claim without recovery where collection of any part of the government's claim will
result in undue hardship to the injured party. Prior to granting a request for waiver, the settlement authority will
consider the factors outlined in &sect;536.229(b)(2) and require the injured party to provide the items listed in
&sect;536.229(b)(2) (i) through (vii). Property damage claims cannot be ``waived.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a tortfeasor or insurer refuses to settle, or if an injured party's attorney improperly withholds funds, the RJA
must consider litigation to protect the interests of the United States. Litigation is particularly appropriate
if a particular insurer consistently refuses to settle claims, or if the Government's interests are not adequately
represented on a large claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) RJA's must maintain close contact with local U.S. Attorney's offices to ensure that these offices are willing
to initiate litigation on cases. RJA's are encouraged to obtain appointments as Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In order to directly initiate or intervene in litigation, an RJA must prepare a litigation report and formally
refer the case through the Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS and the Litigation Division, OTJAG (as required by AR
27&hyph;40, chapter 5) to the U.S. Attorney. While the RJA should attempt to initiate litigation well before the expiration
of the statute of limitations, the RJA may contact USARCS telephonically if statute of limitations problems necessitate
quick action on a case. The RJA should also contact USARCS if a U.S. Attorney is reluctant to pursue an important case.
An injured party's attorney may represent the Government's interest in litigation without any special coordination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Department of Justice requires all cases involving damage to government property of $200,000 and under to
go through the Department of Justice Central Intake Facility in Silver Spring, Maryland, before going to a United
States attorney for litigation. Forward the agency referral package cover sheet and all documentation normally
provided to the U.S. Attorney on all such cases to USARCS, which in turn will forward them to the Central Intake Facility
through the Litigation Division, Office of the Judge Advocate General, as appropriate.

nor may the RJA execute a release which prejudices the Government's right to recover on other claims arising out of
the same incident without the approval of the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS. In addition,
the RJA may not execute a release that purports to release any claim that the injured party may have other than for medical
care furnished or to be furnished by the United States. The RJA will not execute a release if the Government's claim
is waived or terminated.

 Money recovered directly from tortfeasors, from workers' compensation funds, from insurance other than automobile
insurance (such as homeowner's insurance), from automobile insurers for care provided in an MTF prior to 5 November
1990, or from automobile insurers for care provided in a civilian hospital will be deposited in the Miscellaneous

Apportioning medical care recovery between accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Only money recovered under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095 can be deposited into an MTF account. Claims offices will
often have to apportion money recovered among different accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Apportioning money between MTF accounts and the General Treasury. Deposit money recovered from an automobile
insurer for care provided prior to 5 November 1990 or provided in a civilian hospital to the General Treasury. Deposit
money recovered for care provided in an MTF after that date to the MTF's account. If the amount recovered is less than
the amount asserted, deposit money to the MTF's account first, and deposit any remaining money to the General Treasury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Apportioning money between two or more MTF accounts. If care was provided by two or more MTF's on or after 5 November
1990 and the claims office recovers less than the amount asserted, the claims office should give each MTF a pro rata
share of the money recovered. For example, if MTF1 provided $2,000 worth of care and MTF2 provided $1,000 worth of care,
the claims office will deposit $800 of a $1,200 recovery to MTF1's account and the remaining $400 to MTF2's account.

 Journals will be individually maintained for personnel claims, for affirmative claims, and for tort and special
claims, corresponding to the automated claims data management programs for such claims, using the April 1988 version
of this form. Each event requiring entry in the journal will be recorded immediately upon receipt of information as
to its occurrence. Use of the journal for personnel claims is optional, although modified use is highly recommended.

 The automated claims data base will be used for all claims opened in fiscal year 1988 or later, and earlier year claims
if they involve expenditures of funds in fiscal year 1988 or later, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 A claims office will maintain separate investigative files on potentially compensable events (PCE) for every incident
which it (or a unit claims officer) has investigated, or has received a copy of a report of incident or report of investigation
from a unit claims officer or any other source. Similar files will be maintained for incidents investigated by a claims
office or other Army official that might give rise to an affirmative claim in favor of the Army. The investigative file
will be merged into a claims file when a claim is filed or asserted. Investigative files not otherwise merged into a
claims file will be retained until transferred to another Army claims office or until the time for filing a claim has
expired.

Disposition of claims files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commander, USARCS, is the proper authority for post settlement review of claims against the United States.
Claims having the following file numbers under AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 will be forwarded to USARCS (subject to the
provisions of b and c below) for disposition under that regulation: 27&hyph;20a, 27&hyph;20g, 27&hyph;20h, 27&hyph;20i,
27&hyph;20j, or 27&hyph;20q. Claims having other 27&hyph;20 file numbers will be disposed locally according to
the instructions in AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Files of completed tort claims will not be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS prior to the expiration of any appeal
period or the 6-month period for filing suit, as applicable. The file of a tort claim in which an award that is final is
not accepted by the claimant, within a reasonable time, will also be forwarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For personnel claims involving recovery action, claims files will be assembled and processed for local recovery
action or forwarded for centralized recovery action in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, and &sect;&sect;536.195
and 536.196. After completion of final recovery action by field claims offices or command claims services such files
will be forwarded to USARCS for retirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Files will be administratively closed as abandoned or withdrawn and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS, as provided
herein.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Personnel claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Claims under subpart K will be administratively closed as abandoned in the following situations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The claimant affirmatively withdraws or abandons the claim prior to adjudication. Such files will contain evidence
of the claimant's intention to do so, such as a letter from the claimant or a memorandum of a telephone conversation
with the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The claimant cannot be located to be paid or, if the claim is not fully substantiated, to have his or her intentions
with regard to the claim ascertained (but, see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For other reasons, final action on the claim cannot be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When a claimant has neither affirmatively abandoned nor fully substantiated a claim cognizable under subpart
K, he or she should be directed by certified mail to provide the required substantiation within a specified period,
usually 30 days. If correspondence is returned as undeliverable, and the claimant is an active duty service member,
a current military address can usually be obtained from the Commander, U.S. Army Enlisted Records and Evaluation
Center, Army Worldwide Locator Service, ATTN: PCRE&hyph;RF, Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN 46249&hyph;5301. If the
claimant fails to respond, to the extent that the claim is substantiated and meritorious it should be paid; otherwise,
it should be disapproved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Before apparently abandoned claims are forwarded to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USARCS, a certified letter should be sent to the claimant requesting his/her intentions within a specified period,
usually 30 days. If no reply is received within a reasonable time, usually 30 days, the files may be closed and forwarded
to USARCS, except as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Tort claims under subparts D, E and F. Additionally, a paragraph of the letter should state that failure to respond
will result in the presumption that the claim is abandoned. Further, it should be stated that if the claimant is dissatisfied
with the action taken, the claimant may file suit in an appropriate United States District Court no later than six months
from the date of mailing of the letter, or the claimant's remedy will be forever barred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In tort claims under subpart C, the last paragraph should advise the claimant that failure to respond will result
in the presumption that the claim is abandoned, and that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the action taken, the
claimant has a right to appeal the action for a review and final decision. Further, it should be stated that the claimant
only has 60 days to submit such an appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Only after each of the above actions has been completed, may a tort claim be considered to be abandoned, and be forwarded
to USARCS for retirement. If correspondence to a claimant is returned as undelivered, and the claimant is an active
duty service member, a current military address can usually be obtained from the Commander, U.S. Army Enlisted Records
and Evaluation Center, Army Worldwide Locator Service, ATTN: PCRE-RF, Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN 46249&hyph;5301.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Field claims offices will occasionally have need of a file that has been sent to USARCS for centralized recovery
or retirement (for example, action on a ``late'' reconsideration request). When requesting the return of a file from
USARCS (either in writing or telephonically), the requesting office must provide_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claim number.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The contents of each claim file for claims against the United States will be placed in a standard 91/4 inch by 113/4
inch manila folder . The name of the claimant, exactly as entered into the automated claims management data base, will
be placed on the top-left portion of the file folder. The complete nine-digit computer-generated claim number displayed
in the automated database will be placed on the extreme top right-hand side of the folder. The fiscal year, office code,
and claim sequence number will be separated by a dash mark (example, ``88&hyph;011&hyph;0079''). Both name and claim
file number entries on the manila file folder will be printed legibly in blue-black ink. The claim file should be stapled
together before inserting in the file folder; however, the file need only be placed in the folder without stapling
to the file folder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Investigative files will also be maintained in manila folders. The date of the incident and general descriptive
data (for example, ``1 Jul 86/ auto accident (1st and Elm, Smallville)'' or ``24 Sep 86/ heart operation (Jones, John
M.)'') will be placed on the top-left portion of the file folder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 requires labeling of file folders and containers with specific information. In complying
therewith, the following guidance is provided: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only the ``dummy'' or ``lead'' folder will contain the disposition instructions required by AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2,
for files that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a common disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When labeling individual file folders, only the information required by AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 will be typed
on the label. The label will be placed on the top center portion of the folder. Under no circumstances will the information
concerning the claim (see paragraph (a) of this section) be placed on this label.

(b) The data contained in the USARCS Claims Automation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program and the monthly claims office status reports generated by the automation software provide the data necessary
to make sound management decisions by claims officers, by heads of area claims offices, by SJAs responsible for OCONUS
command claims services, and by the Commander, USARCS. The system provides a uniform method of assignment of claim
file numbers to permit identification and retrieval of individual claim files, identifies delay in claims processing,
and permits worldwide management control of all claims against the Government. The automated monthly reports forwarded
to USARCS provide the data base used for the preparation of claims budgetary status reports and periodic budget estimates
to the USAFAC as well as to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management). It is the responsibility
of all claims office personnel to ensure that automated claims records are complete and accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This section does not apply to the reporting of reimbursement obligations to foreign countries pursuant to the

the Affirmative Claims Management Program, and the Tort and Special Claims Management Program, with updated versions
as required. These are the only programs authorized for recording and reporting claims in the Army Claims System.
Local modification of these programs is not authorized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The head of each area claims office and command claims service will ensure that a monthly computer-generated claims
report is prepared for each claims office with an office code within his or her area of responsibility and for each Foreign
Claims Commission using the automation programs provided by USARCS. The report(s) (tort claims only) and diskettes
containing current claims data base(s) (for all programs) will be posted to USARCS by the fifth calendar day of the
month. In addition, a copy of any archive disk prepared during the reporting period will be forwarded for processing.
Whenever possible, the data should be sent using a modem or other electronic data transfer system. Claims offices
under the jurisdiction of a command claims service will forward their report(s) and diskettes through the command
claims service and will comply with any additional reporting requirements of the command claims service. Diskettes
must be marked with the office name, the office code, the type of claim record, the disk sequence number, the month and
year, and the data base file name(s) contained in the diskette (for example, Fort Blank, 001, Tort Claims, 1 of 1, Mar
89, T9000103.1DB). Detailed instructions on the preparation of the monthly automated claims report and claims data
diskettes are contained in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 12 and program documentation. If there are no changes from
the previous month in the Affirmative Claims reports, the Personnel Claims report, or the Tort and Special Claims
report, a negative report will be submitted within the stated time guidelines.

. Quarterly, each command claims service or office authorized to assert affirmative claims will submit a copy of the
``Previous Three Months'' report generated by the Affirmative Claims Management Program to USARCS, ATTN: JACS-PCA.
Command claims services and offices will identify these reports by quarter and fiscal year (i.e. ``1st Qtr, FY 93'')
and forward them so that they arrive not later than the 7th calendar day of every quarter (i.e., 7 January, 7 April, 7
July, and 7 October each year). Offices authorized to assert affirmative claims which have no affirmative claims
activity in a given quarter will forward negative reports.

Each claims settlement or approval authority which is furnished a CEA by the USARCS budget office is responsible for
managing that CEA. This includes knowing at all times how much of the CEA has been obligated, the remaining balance
and a monthly assessment of whether the balance will cover claims obligation needs in the local office for the remainder
of the current fiscal year.

Solatia payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Payment of solatia in accordance with local custom as an expression of sympathy toward a victim or his or her family
is common in overseas commands (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chap 8). Such payments are not to be made from the claims CEA.
These payments are made from local operation and maintenance funds pursuant to directives established by the appropriate
commander for the country concerned. This applies even where a command claims service is directed to administer the
command's solatia program.

The Government's statutory right to recover money, property, or repayment in kind incurred as a result of property
loss, damage, or destruction by any individual, partnership, association, or other legal entity, foreign or domestic,
except an instrumentality of the United States. Also, the Government's statutory right to recover the reasonable
medical costs expended for hospital, medical, surgical, or dental care and treatment (including prostheses and

Civilian Employee

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person whose activities the Government has the right to direct and control, not only as to the result to be accomplished
but also as the means used. This includes, but is not limited to, full-time Federal civilian officers and employees.
This term should be distinguished from ``independent contractor'' for whose actions the Government generally is
not liable. The decision as to who is a civilian employee is a Federal question determined under Federal, not under
local law.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Program Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Older Americans Act was first enacted in 1965 and was amended eleven times between 1965 and 1992. The President
signed the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;375) on September 30, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 23, 1993, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, pursuant to the
authority permitted by section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953, 42 U.S.C. 3501, and 5 U.S.C. 301, designated
the position of Assistant Secretary for Aging to perform the duties and functions of the Commissioner of Aging. The
term ``Commissioner'' will be used in these regulations, however, in order to comport with Public Law 102&hyph;375,
which retains the title of Commissioner for the head of the Administration on Aging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act reemphasize the intention of the Congress to target services and resources
on the needs and problems of those older individuals identified as having the greatest economic need, the greatest
social need, and those who are low-income minority. These amendments, for the first time, require that approval of
the State plan be dependent on approval of the intrastate funding formula. The basis of these regulations are those
provisions of the 1992 amendments to the Act that directly affect a State's intrastate funding formula and which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require the Commissioner on Aging under section 304(c) of the Act to approve a State's intrastate funding formula
prior to the release of Title III funds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require State agencies under section 307(a)(33) of the Act to include descriptive statements about the intrastate
funding formula's assumptions, goals, and outcomes based on the allocation of funds to each Planning and Service
Area; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require the Commissioner on Aging under section 305(a)(2)(C) to assist States in the development of their
intrastate funding formulas by providing them with guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Purpose of the NPRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administration on Aging (AoA) is proposing to revise the current rules governing the State agencies' development
and submission of an intrastate funding formula by providing new guidance and to amend the current rules affecting
State plans and State plan submissions. These revisions are designed to be consistent with those provisions in the
1992 amendments to the Act that require greater targeting on those older individuals in greatest economic need, greatest
social need, and low-income minority older individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;375) now require States to submit their intrastate
funding formulas to the Commissioner on Aging for approval, rather than only for review and comment, as was the case
prior to the 1992 amendments. The amendments also require the Commissioner to provide guidance to States in the development
of their intrastate funding formulas. AoA has interpreted the amendments to require that this guidance be in addition
to the language contained in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the statute which requires State agencies to take into account
the geographic distribution, greatest economic and greatest social need of older individuals in the development
of their intrastate funding formulas. If the Commissioner does not approve the intrastate funding formula, a new
requirement under section 304(c) requires the Commissioner to withhold the State's allotment of funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to comply with these new statutory requirements as well as address the intent of Congress that targeting services
and resources on the needs and problems of those older individuals identified as having the greatest economic need,
the greatest social need, and those who are low-income minority be accomplished through the intrastate funding formula,
the Commissioner has developed standards for review and provided directions to a State agency on how to evaluate whether
its formula meets those standards. The proposed regulations are designed to provide a State agency with flexibility
to either maintain its current formula or, if necessary to allow for the development of a modified or new formula that
addresses the requirements set out by Congress in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the Older Americans Act. These proposed
regulations require that careful consideration be given to the geographic distribution of older individuals in
the State, and the distribution among the planning and service areas of older individuals with greatest economic
need and older individuals with greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 304(c) now requires the Commissioner to withhold funds if the Commissioner does not approve a State's intrastate
funding formula. In the course of developing these intrastate funding formulas, States are now required, under sections
305(a)(2)(C) and 305(d), to publish their intrastate funding formulas for review and comment by the public. This
publication for review and comment must include: ``(1) A descriptive statement of the formula's assumptions and
goals, and the application of the definitions of greatest economic or social need; (2) a numerical statement of the
actual funding formula to be used; (3) a listing of the population, economic, and social data to be used for each planning
and service area in the State; and (4) a demonstration of the allocation of funds, pursuant to the funding formula,
to each planning and service area in the State.'' In addition, section 307(a)(33) now requires the State plan to include
the statement and the demonstration required by paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 305(d), and provides that the Commissioner
may not approve the State plan unless the Commissioner approves the statement and demonstration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these new requirements, AoA believes it is of critical importance that States have as much time as possible
to review their current intrastate funding formulas, and, if necessary, modify them or develop new formulas; to consult
with area agencies as required in section 305(a)(2)(C); to publish their plans for review and comment as required
in section 305(d); and to seek and obtain legislation or legislative approval prior to submitting the formulas for
approval, if necessary. To ensure that States have the time to accomplish these steps, AoA is publishing this NPRM
separately from, and in advance of, its notice of other rules being developed in response to the 1992 amendments to
the Act.

1321.3&blank;Definitions_The term ``low-income'' is added in order to clarify its direct relationship to the new
definition of poverty added to Title I by the 1992 amendments to the Act, and to assist State agencies in targeting resources
when they develop their intrastate funding formulas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``medically underserved areas,'' as used in &sect;1321.37(g) of this proposed rule, is added to clarify
where funds should be targeted in developing a method to allocate funds provided under section 303(f) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``minority'' as defined in 28 CFR, subpart F, &sect;42.402 (e) is added in order to clarify who is a minority
for the purposes of assisting States to determine who is a low-income minority older individual in developing their

The term ``periodic,'' as used in sections 306(a)(6) and 307(a)(8) of the Act and part 1321 with respect to evaluations
of, reports on, and public hearings on, activities carried out under State and area plans, is added to clarify that
the term means, at a minimum, once each fiscal year (annually).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``rural area'' is defined as required by section 307(a)(37) of the Act, to clarify the definition of rural
area within a planning and service area, and to assist States in identifying actual and projected additional costs
of providing services in rural areas as required under section 307(a)(37) as well as in the development of their intrastate
funding formulas.

1321.17&blank;Content of State plan_this subjection is amended to reflect and clarify additional requirements
in the 1992 amendments to the Act, to remove those sections and paragraphs that are now unnecessary because they are
set forth in the Act under the 1992 amendments, and to assure that States provide adequate descriptions and exhibits
in the State plan to assist the public in understanding changes required by the 1992 amendments. The NPRM proposes
to remove the assurances now required under current &sect;1321.17(f)(1)&hyph;(3), (8)&hyph;(10), (13), and (15)
as unnecessary because they are now reflected in the 1992 amendments to the Act. The following new requirements are
proposed pursuant to the 1992 amendments:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 1321.17(c)(1)&hyph;(4) is amended to require the State to show the distribution of Title III funds using

(2) Section 1321.17(c)(5) is added to assist AoA in monitoring and assessing the State's progress in meeting the new
requirements under section 307(a)(37) of the Act which require that State plans identify, for each fiscal year of
the plan, the actual and projected additional costs for providing services to older individuals residing in rural
areas. In addition, the information obtained under this section will assist AoA in carrying out the requirements
of section 202(b)(27)(A) of the Act which requires the Commissioner to ``conduct a study to determine ways in which
Federal funds might be more effectively targeted to low-income minority older individuals, and older individuals
residing in rural areas, to better meet the needs of States with a disproportionate number of older individuals with
greatest economic need and older individuals with greatest social need.'' It is our expectation that providing this
information in the State plan will greatly reduce the paperwork burden that would be incurred with a separate national
study conducted solely for this purpose. Accordingly, using the definition of rural areas in &sect;1321.3 of this
NPRM, we propose that each State plan include a table displaying planning and service areas (PSA's) ranked by the proportion
of rural older individuals in each as a percentage of the rural population in the State; showing the distribution of
Title III funds in each PSA under the current intrastate funding formula and under the proposed intrastate funding
formula (IFF); and the source of the distribution information (which must by law be the best available data).

In the above hypothetical example, the table shows the effect on rural areas of a proposed intrastate funding formula
which would reduce the funds allocated to PSA&hyph;A and PSA&hyph;D, and increase the funds allocated to PSA&hyph;F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 1321.17(f)(9)(i) (previously 1321.17(f)(14)(i)) is revised to clarify when a State agency may permit
an area agency to use Title III service dollars to fund program development and coordination activities. Under current
policy, AoA provides State and area agencies with the flexibility to explore new and alternative methods for providing
supportive and nutrition services through a comprehensive and coordinated delivery system by permitting the expenditure
of service dollars, under section 304(d)(1)(D), for that purpose. During the past five years, State and area agencies
have raised issues about whether section 1321.17(c)(14)(i) of the current rule clearly establishes the threshold
at which State agencies may allow area agencies to so use section 304(d)(1)(D) service funds is based on the total allotment
of Title III dollars awarded a State, including State plan administration, or based on the total amount of Title III
dollars awarded to area agencies for the provision of supportive and nutrition services under section 304(d)(1)(D)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation makes clear that a State agency may not fund program development and coordinated activities as a cost
of supportive services until the State agency has funded area plan administration to a level of at least 10 percent
of the Title III funds in section 304(d)(1)(D), with the exception of those funds provided for in section 303(b)(3)
and section 303(f), which are not distributed through the State's IFF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 1321.17(f)(10) is added to require a new assurance that States provide the Commissioner with a periodic
update of the plan to reflect the actual and projected additional costs of providing services in rural areas, as required
by the new section 307(a)(37) of the Act;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 1321.17(f)(11) is added to require a new assurance that the State agency, in consultation with each area
agency, will set specific objectives for the provision of Title III funded services to low-income minority older
individuals, and assure that such objectives are included in the area plan; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 1321.17(f)(12) is added to require a new assurance that the State will support area plan objectives by
undertaking specific program development, advocacy, and outreach efforts focused on the needs of low-income minority
older individuals and provide the Commissioner with a written description of its activities to be included in the
Commissioner's annual report to the Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Section 1321.17(g) is added to clarify and set out those requirements that States which are designated Single
Planning and Service Areas must meet to receive a grant under Title III of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1321.21&blank;Submission of the State plan or plan amendments to the Commissioner for approval_this section is
revised by requiring States to submit their State plans or plan amendments for approval at least 90 days prior to the
effective date of the plan or plan amendment rather than the current 45 days. This change was made in order to facilitate
simultaneous review and technical assistance, if needed, by the AoA Regional Office. The additional 45 days also
provides the State agency with additional time to discuss any deficiencies the Regional Office may find in the State
plan or the intrastate funding formula and for the State to correct them. It is AoA's intention that this additional
time during the pre-approval period will assist States and AoA in assuring that State plans and intrastate funding
formulas are approved in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1321.37&blank;Intrastate funding formula_this section is revised to comply with the 1992 amendments to the Act
that require the Commissioner to provide guidelines to State agencies in the development of their intrastate funding
formulas, and to approve each State's intrastate funding formula as a condition of approving the State plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commissioner's guidelines are intended to provide State agencies with criteria for developing intrastate funding
formulas that target the needs of those in greatest economic and social need, and low-income minorities within each
PSA. The guidelines also provide area agencies, service providers, older individuals, units of general purpose
local government, and the pubic with a method by which to assess the State's proposed intrastate funding formula impact
in each planning and service area. We anticipate that the public hearing process at both the State and local levels
will provide groups, organizations, and individuals that may be affected with as much information as possible about
the actual impact the formula will have on current and projected plans and services within the PSA's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA is aware that there may be changes in the allocation of Title III funds to PSA's if State agencies determine that
it is necessary to modify current or develop new intrastate funding formulas in response to changes in demographics,
or in compliance with the Commissioner's guidelines in these regulations. Whether the formula remains the same,
is modified or a new formula is developed, it is essential that the process of targeting older individuals in greatest
economic and social need with particular emphasis on low-income minority individuals have a demonstrable outcome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 Amendments strengthen the targeting provisions of the OAA through a number of requirements relating to State
Units on Aging (SUAs), area agencies on aging (AAAs) and service providers. The Amendments require SUAs to set specific
objectives and describe actions used to increase participation of low-income minority older individuals (Section
305(a)(2)(G)); require SUAs to provide technical assistance to minority service providers (Section 305(a)(1)(D));
require area plans to include specific service objectives for minority targeting (Section 306(a)(5)(A)(i)); provide
assurances that providers serve low-income minority individuals in accordance with their need for services (Section
306(a)(5)(A)(ii)); and require that all AAA activities must include a focus on the needs of low-income minority older
individuals (Section 306(a)(5)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining how funds available under Title III are to be distributed to implement these objectives, the 1992 Amendments
make it clear that States must base the distribution of funds on an intrastate funding formula that takes into account
the distribution of older individuals, and of older individuals with greatest economic need and older individuals
with greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals. The Amendments
also require that the SUA submit its formula to the Commissioner for approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria developed in these guidelines are based on the principle that funds and services should be targeted on
older individuals in greatest economic need and older individuals in greatest social need, with particular attention
to low-income minority older individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) to be approved, the formula may not allocate less funds to each PSA with a high concentration of low-income minority
older individuals than would have been allocated to each of these PSA's by application of the current formula to the
most recent decennial U.S. census data or the best available data.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the provisions in the Act which require particular attention to low-income minority older individuals,
this criterion is intended to ensure that the proposed formula will not divert funds from PSA's with the highest concentrations
of such individuals, when applied to the same population data as the old formula.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) to be approved, the formula may not allocate less funds, from the total amount subject to allocation, to each PSA
with a high concentration of low-income minority older individuals that would be allocated to each of these PSA's
if the formula submitted for approval were based solely on the factors of age, i.e., 60+, and greatest economic need,
i.e., the proportion of older individuals below the poverty line.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the provisions in the Act which require particular attention to low-income minority older individuals,
the introduction of social need factors in the formula should, if anything, increase funds distributed to PSA's with
the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals to an amount no less than would go to the PSA based
only on age and economic need. In no event may the introduction of social need factors decrease such funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A standard procedure is proposed for identifying the PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority
older individuals. After the State ranks the PSA's based on the proportion of low-income minority older individuals
to all older individuals in the PSA, those PSA's with the highest proportion of low-income minority individuals which,
taken together, contain 51 percent of all low-income minority older individuals in the State shall be, for the purposes
of this rule, considered the PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the example above, PSA's A and B constitute the PSAs with the highest concentration of low-income minority older
individuals (see column 4) and have a combined total of 76% of the State's total low-income minority elderly population
(see column 6), which meets the 51% requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This example represents a hypothetical State's proposed formula that meets the proposed criteria for approval in
that PSA's A and B would not receive less funds under the proposed formula (col. 9 ) than either would have received by
application of the current formula to the most recent decennial U.S. census data (col. 7), and neither PSA would receive
less funds under the formula (col. 9) than it would if funds were distributed solely on the basis of age and greatest
economic need (col. 8). Finally, this example shows that when more than one PSA is required to accumulate 51 percent
of the low-income minority older individuals in the State, the distribution to each such PSA must satisfy both specified
criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA has developed the criteria for approval of an intrastate funding formula so as to ensure that social need factors
do not result in decreased funding to PSA's with the highest concentration of low-income minority older individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that the proposed guidelines do not speak to the distributional effects on PSA's which contain the other 49
percent of the low-income minority older individuals in the State (which may also contain a significant number of
older individuals in greatest economic need, greatest social need, and low-income minority older individuals).
However, it should be observed that the law requires that SUAs, area agencies on aging, and service providers utilize
effective methods of targeting services to older individuals who are in the greatest economic need and the greatest
social need, with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in all PSA's
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, irrespective of the distribution of Title III funds, the SUA's, AAA's, and service providers are required
to comply with the targeting requirements in the Act, using such Title III funds and other sources as are available
to support services to individuals in targeted groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1321.76&blank;Appeal process to the Commissioner_this subsection is added to Subpart E to reflect the Commissioner's
new responsibilities under section 305(b)(5)(C)(i) of the 1992 amendments to the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We anticipate that some Title III funds may shift among PSA's if intrastate funding formulas are modified or changed
in accordance with these proposed regulations. Although the 1992 amendments to the Act and these proposed rules do
not require a change in PSA boundaries, section 305(a)(1)(E) of the Act requires States to consider the total number
of older individuals 60+, older individuals in greatest economic need, and older individuals in greatest social
need, with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals residing in the State, in dividing the
State into distinct PSA's. As a result of the 1990 census, States may elect to change some PSA boundaries in order to
reflect changes in demographics and geographic locations of particular groups of older individuals based on the
1990 census. AoA is proposing this new rule to provide parties adversely affected by a State's decision to change PSA
boundaries with an opportunity to appeal to the Commissioner, pursuant to section 305(b)(5)(C) of the Act.

reflect the requirements of the 1992 amendments to the Act which allow an appeal to the Secretary of HHS after the Commissioner
has disapproved a State's plan, plan amendment or intrastate funding formula. AoA includes these revisions in these
proposed rules in order to clarify appeals procedures that are to apply when the Commissioner does not approve the
intrastate funding formula under section 305(a)(2)(C) or otherwise finds that a State plan has failed to meet the
requirements of Section 307.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department of Health and Human Services has determined that this
rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective
and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives.

Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility
analysis for a proposed or final rule if the rule would have significant economic impact on a substantial number of
``small entities'', i.e. small businesses, small non-profit organizations, or small governmental jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsibility for meeting the requirements of the regulations proposed in this NPRM is on the State agencies
and to a lesser extent on area agencies. Actual delivery of services may be provided in some circumstances by proprietary,
public, and not-for-profit agencies or organizations under grants or contracts from State or area agencies. Although
area agencies and most service delivery agencies and organizations are ``small entities'' within the meaning of
the Act, this rule will impose no significant burdens on State agencies, area agencies or other affected parties and
will provide flexibility to State and area agencies in implementing the provisions of the Act. For these reasons,
the Secretary hereby certifies that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;375) now require States to submit their intrastate
funding formulas to the Commissioner on Aging for approval, rather than only for review and comment, as was the case
prior to the 1992 amendments. The amendments also require the Commission to provide guidance to States in the development
of their intrastate funding formulas. AoA has interpreted the amendments to require that this guidance be in addition
to the language contained in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the statute which requires State agencies to take into account
the geographic distribution, greatest economic and greatest social need of older individuals, with particular
attention to low-income minority individuals, in the development of their intrastate funding formulas. If the Commissioner
does not approve the intrastate funding formula, a new requirement under section 304(c) requires the Commissioner
to withhold the State's allotment of supportive and nutrition funds under Title III of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to comply with these new statutory requirements as well as address the intent of Congress, the Commissioner
has developed regulatory standards, and provided directions for each State agency on how to evaluate whether its
formula meets those standards. The proposed regulations are designed to provide a State agency with flexibility
to either maintain its current formula or, if necessary, to allow for the development of a modified or new formula that
addresses the requirements set out by Congress in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the Act. These proposed regulations require
that careful consideration be given to the geographic distribution of older individuals in the State, and the distribution
among the planning and service areas of older individuals with greatest economic need and older individuals with
greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because section 304(c) now requires the Commissioner to withhold funds if the Commissioner does not approve a State's
intrastate funding formula, States cannot reasonably be expected to develop intrastate funding formulas that can
be approved, unless they receive regulatory guidelines. Further, in the course of developing their intrastate funding
formulas, States are required, under sections 305(a)(2)(C) and 305(d), to publish their intrastate funding formulas
for review and comment by the public. This publication for review and comment must include: ``(1) A descriptive statement
of the formula's assumptions and goals, and the application of the definitions of greatest economic or social need;
(2) a numerical statement of the actual funding formula to be used; (3) a listing of the population, economic, and social
data to be used for each planning and service area in the State; and (4) a demonstration of the allocation of funds, pursuant
to the funding formula, to each planning and service area in the State.'' In addition, section 307(a)(33) now requires
the State plan to include the statement and the demonstration required by paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 305(d)
of the Act. The Commissioner may not approve the State plan unless the Commissioner approves the statement and demonstration.
These proposed regulations provide States with guidelines on how to make an acceptable numerical statement and an
acceptable demonstration of the allocation of funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for estimates: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allows States to submit their State plans every two, three, or four years. Our estimates are based on the
average number of State plan submissions per year during the four year periods between Older Americans Act reauthorizations.
We estimate that 11 State agencies will incur regulatory burdens in complying with the requirements under proposed
sections 1321.17 (c), (d), and (e); 11 State agencies will incur regulatory burdens in complying with proposed section
1321.17(g); and 4 State agencies and trust territories will incur regulatory burdens in complying with proposed
section 1321.17(h). Because some States have chosen two or three year State plans, they will either submit new plans
or amend approved plans more than once during the four years between reauthorizations. The table above projects our
estimate that on average 26 of the 57 State agencies and trust territories will incur burdens on complying with these
proposed requirements once a year.

need as the only factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The State agency shall publish the formula for review and comment by older individuals, other appropriate agencies

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice seeks public comment on general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory actions
to address the effects of aircraft overflights on national parks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 22, 1993, Transportation Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced
the formation of an interagency working group to explore ways to limit or reduce impacts from overflights on national
parks. Secretary Babbitt and Secretary Pe&ntilde;a concur that increased flight operations at the Grand Canyon
and other national parks have significantly diminished the national park experience for park visitors, and that
measures can and should be taken to preserve a quality park experience for visitors. The Secretaries see the formation
of the working group, and the mutual commitment to addressing the impacts of park overflights, as the initial steps
in a new spirit of cooperation between the two departments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National parks are unique national resources that have been provided special protection by law. The National Park
Service (NPS) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognize that excessive noise from commercial air
tours and other flights over units of the national parks system can interfere with NPS efforts to achieve a natural
park experience for visitors and to preserve other park values. Through the interagency working group, the NPS and
FAA will cooperate in developing measures to resolve current noise impacts and prevent potential future impacts
from overflights at national parks. The purpose of this ANPRM is twofold. First, the ANPRM addresses overflights
of Grand Canyon National Park and national parks in the State of Hawaii, with particular emphasis on overflights by
commercial tour operators. Second, the ANPRM solicits policy views and recommendations on more general issues as
part of an effort to form a comprehensive policy on preventing, minimizing, or eliminating impacts of aircraft overflights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice presents options that may be considered as means to minimize the adverse effects of commercial air tour
operations and other overflights on units of the national park system, and seeks public comments and suggestions
on voluntary and regulatory actions to deal with noise and other overflight issues that may affect national parks.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The management of the national park system is guided by the Constitution, public laws (Pub. L.), proclamations, executive
orders, rules and regulations, and directives of the Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary for Fish
and Wildlife and Parks. The Act of August 25, 1916, otherwise known as the NPS Organic Act, established the NPS and serves
as the touchstone for national park system management philosophy and policy. The Act created the NPS to promote and
regulate national parks, monuments, and reservations in accordance with the fundamental purpose of said parks,
monuments, and reservations, which is ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife
therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for
the enjoyment of future generations.'' (16 U.S.C. 1). Subsequent legislation further states that any authorized
activity ``shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes'' of a park area or the national park system,
except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress. (16 U.S.C. 1a&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, ``unimpairment'' is joined by a responsibility to avoid derogation not only of the purposes of a park area but
also the values for which the national park system and its individual units have been established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, the Congress enacted the NPS Overflights Act because it recognized that aircraft overflights can adversely
affect national parks. The Act specifically found that noise associated with aircraft overflight at the Grand Canyon
National Park was causing ``a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current
operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding safety of park users.'' (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;91, section 3(a)). The Act mandated a number of studies related to the effects of overflights on parks.
The studies have taken longer than was originally anticipated because many of the issues with which they deal are on
the cutting edge of technical and scientific capability. Measuring degrees of quiet and perception of quiet is very
different from measuring amounts of noise. Since the Overflights Act was passed, the adverse effects associated
with the numbers and extent of commercial air sightseeing tours have continued to expand.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The general and over-arching responsibilities for park management by NPS may be modified by specific direction in
individual enabling legislation and proclamations. The individual statutes and proclamations for some units of
the national park system make it clear that the units were established to provide visitors with natural quiet, an opportunity
for solitude, and other attributes that are not necessarily compatible with the noise of commercial air tour sightseeing
flights. Some people simply find commercial sightseeing tours over parks inappropriate and incompatible with protection
of certain park values and resources. On the other hand, a commercial air tour may provide an opportunity for people
to see some park resources in ways not otherwise attainable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is pointed out in the Management Policies (NPS 1988):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
Over the years, legislative and administrative actions have been taking place that have brought some measure of change
to these components of our national parks. Such actions impact park resources, yet they are not necessarily deemed
to have impaired resources for the enjoyment of future generations. Whether an individual action is or is not an ``impairment''
is a management determination based on NPS policy. In reaching it, the manager should consider such factors as the
spatial and temporal extent of the impacts, the resources being impacted and their ability to adjust to those impacts,
the relation of the impacted resources to other park resources, and the cumulative as well as the individual effects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Both physical resources, such as wildlife or geologic features or cultural resources, and intangible values, such
as natural quiet solitude, and the experience of wilderness, can be impaired.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Impacts to Parks
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the case of commercial air tour sightseeing flights operating over and near units of the national park system, the
NPS believes that significant park resources are being impaired in some units. Managers of almost one-third of national
park system units perceive a problem with some aspect of already existing aircraft overflights. The sound of aircraft
is regarded as the primary impact. A survey of park managers confirmed that mechanical noise is among the more serious
problems in parks and aircraft noise is the most prominent among these. The perception of noise and adverse effects
in units of the national park system may be related to the fact that parks tend to be quieter places in general and that
typical sources of noise found in urban and suburban settings are absent in most parks. The potential exists for impairment
of park resources and values by the noise and visual intrusion associated with commercial air tour/sightseeing operations
in other units where the air tour sightseeing industry is not yet established or developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the changes in our population distribution, patterns of use of our national parks, and other factors related
to transportation, it is no longer sufficient for park managers to consider strategies and actions solely within
park boundaries to protect parks and their resources. Overflights are a case in point. Most overflights of units of
the national park system begin and end at airports outside parks; the attractions the overflights offer are the resources
of the parks themselves. Technically, the park overflight passenger is not a park visitor even though there may be
significant adverse effects from noise on the park. In recognition of this fact, the FAA and the NPS are working more
closely to use the FAA's plenary authority for regulation of aviation in support of NPS management objectives.

FAA Authorities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has broad authority and responsibility to regulate the operation of aircraft and the use of the navigable airspace,
and to establish safety standards for and regulate the certification of airmen, aircraft, and air carriers. (Federal
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (FAAct), Section 307(a) and (c); Title VI.) The FAAct provides guidance to the Administrator
in carrying out this responsibility. Section 102 of the FAAct states that the Administrator will consider the public
interest to include among other things, regulation for safety and efficiency of both civil and military operations,
promotion of the development of civil aviation, fulfillment of the requirements of national defense, and operation
of a common system of air traffic control for civil and military aircraft. Section 104 provides to each citizen of the
United States a public right of transit through the navigable airspace of the United States. Section 305 directs and
authorizes the Administrator to encourage and foster the development of civil aeronautics and air commerce. Section
306 requires the Administrator in exercising his authority, to give full consideration to the requirements of national
defense, commercial and general aviation, and to the public right of freedom of transit through the navigable airspace.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA's authority is not limited to regulation for aviation safety, efficiency, and development. Subsection 307(c)
of the FAAct provides that FAA air traffic rules and flight regulations may be adopted ``for the protection of persons
and property on the ground.'' The FAA considers this protection to extend to environmental values on the surface as
well as to the safety of persons and property. Section 611 of the FAAct, ``in order to afford present and future relief
to the public health and welfare from aircraft noise,'' directs the Administrator to adopt regulations ``as the FAA
may find necessary for the control and abatement of aircraft noise,'' including application of such regulations
to any of the various certificates issued under Title VI. Finally, it is the general policy of the Federal government
that the FAA, like other agencies, will exercise its authority in a manner that will enhance the environment, and that
the FAA will make a special effort to preserve the natural beauty of public park and recreation lands, wilderness areas,
and wildlife refuges. Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321; Section
4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. 303; and Executive Order 11514, as amended by Executive Order
11991. In addition, the DOT has further authority to regulate services by commercial operators.

Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, August 10, 1993) amended Section 4 of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;6a) requiring the NPS to impose a commercial tour use fee on each
vehicle entering a unit of the national park system, that presently charges an entrance fee, for the purpose of providing
commercial tour services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to surface transportation, this commercial use fee applies to aircraft entering ``the airspace of units
of the National Park System'' identified in sections 2(b) and 3 of Public Law 100.91 (Grand Canyon National Park and
Haleakala National Park) as well as any other park areas where the level of commercial aircraft services are equal
to or greater than these two identified areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual fees established by the legislation are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;$25 per vehicle with a capacity of 25 people or less, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;$50 per vehicle with a capacity greater than 25 people. The legislation also gives the Secretary the authority
to make reasonable adjustments to these recommended commercial tour fees. Currently, there are no additional NPS
areas that charge entrance fees, and also have a level of commercial aircraft services equal or greater to Grand Canyon
or Haleakala National Parks. As a result of the legislation, the NPS will need to monitor the number of air tour operations
over the affected parks.

Grand Canyon National Park
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At Grand Canyon, 42 companies offer aerial tours operating from five states (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah,
and New Mexico). These companies provide air tours of the Grand Canyon to about 750,000 people and generate revenues
in excess of $100 million. During peak summer months, the number of tours exceeds 10,000 each month. On June 5, 1987,
the FAA issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 50&hyph;1 (52 FR 22734, June 15, 1987) which provided
rules to enhance safety of overflight operations in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon National Park. Section 3 of Public
Law 100&hyph;91 required the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI) to submit to the FAA Administrator
recommendations for the protection of resources in the Grand Canyon from adverse impacts associated with aircraft
overflights. The recommendations were to provide for substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience
of the Grand Canyon. With limited exceptions, the recommendations were to prohibit the flight of aircraft below the
rim of the Canyon and to designate zones that were flight free except for purposes of administration of underlying
lands and emergency operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;91 further required the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and issue a final plan for the management
of air traffic above the Grand Canyon. In December 1987, the DOI submitted recommendations to the FAA for an aircraft
management plan at the Grand Canyon. The recommendations included both rulemaking and non-rulemaking actions.
On May 27, 1988, the FAA issued SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 (53 FR 20264, June 2, 1988) which revises the procedures for operation
of aircraft in the airspace above the Grand Canyon. The rule implements the preliminary recommendations of the Secretary
of the Interior for an aircraft management plan at the Grand Canyon with some modifications that the FAA initiated
in the interest of aviation safety. SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 establishes a Special Flight Rules Area from the surface to
14,500 feet above mean seal level (MSL) in the area of the Grand Canyon. The SFAR prohibits flight below a certain altitude
in each of five sectors of this area with some exceptions. The SFAR also establishes flight free zones from the surface
to 14,500 feet msl above large areas of the park. The ``flight free zones'' cover virtually all of the visitors to the
North and South Rims and about 90 percent of backcountry users. The SFAR also provided special routes for commercial
tour operators and transient operators through the canyon area, Commercial air tour operations are required to be
conducted as air taxi and commercial operations under part 135 with stringent requirements including special operations
specifications for Grand Canyon. The NPS believes the SFAR has been successful in limiting some noise-associated
adverse impacts to the park but most, if not all, of the gain has been, or may be, lost as a result of the exponential growth
in numbers of flights over the canyon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Virtually every class of visitor activity at Grand Canyon National Park is limited or controlled in some way by the
NPS to insure that there will be no derogation or impairment of resources and values. Each raft trip on the Colorado
River through Grand Canyon National Park must have a permit and the number of permits is limited for both commercial
and private rafters. For some private raft trips, a permit may take 4 or 5 years to obtain. Each over-night visitor in
the backcountry must have a backcountry permit; the demand for such permits far exceeds the supply. The waiting list
for trips by mule into the inner canyon runs into years for some times of the year. There are a limited number of hotel
rooms in the park and there are a limited number of parking spaces. In contrast, the commercial air tour sector has experienced
unlimited growth at Grand Canyon National Park in the last 10 years. This is so even though Congress found noise associated
with overflights to be significantly and adversely affecting the park in the 1987 Overflights Act. In addition, the
NPS believes there is ample evidence that the uncontrolled and unregulated growth in this sector is in derogation
of the resources and values of the park. NPS studies to that effect will be published later this year.

Public Law 100&hyph;91 directed the DOI to substantially restore ``natural quiet'' to the Grand Canyon National
Park. Public Law 100&hyph;91 also required a study of aircraft noise impacts at a number of national parks and imposed
flight restrictions at three parks: Grand Canyon National Park, Yosemite National Park in California, and Haleakala
National Park in Hawaii. Public Law 100&hyph;91 also required the DOI to conduct a study, with the technical assistance
of the Secretary of Transportation, to determine the proper minimum altitude to be maintained by aircraft when flying
over units of the national park system. The research was to include an evaluation of the noise levels associated with
overflights. Before submission to Congress, the DOI is to provide a draft report (containing the results of its studies)
and recommendations for legislative and regulatory action to the FAA for review. The FAA is to notify the DOI of any
adverse effects these recommendations would have on the safety of aircraft operations. The FAA is to consult with
the DOI to resolve these issues. The final report must include a finding by the FAA that implementation of the DOI recommendations
will not have adverse effects on the safety of aircraft operations, or, in the alternative, a statement of the reasons
why the recommendations will have an adverse effect. The DOI expects to complete the report by early summer, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The national parks in Hawaii_Hawaii Volcanoes and Haleakala_have similar problems with commercial air sightseeing
tours, principally noise associated with helicopters. The FAA held a series of public hearings in January 1994 to
elicit public comments and recommendations for regulatory or policy action related to overflights, including their
effects on parks. There are 9 tour operators on the island of Hawaii, and there are approximately 60 commercial air
tours a day over Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. At Haleakala, which was established to preserve resources in ``natural
condition,'' (39 Stat. 432, section 4), seven companies based on the island of Maui offer helicopter tours. On clear
days, helicopters fly over the park during all hours of daylight so that helicopter noise is audible over 30 minutes
of every daylight hour (personal communication, Haleakala National Park). Interpretive talks, wildlife observations
and censuses, ceremonies, and other normal activities are interrupted by air tour overflights. The NPS recognizes
that the commercial air tour industry is important to the economy of Hawaii but also believes that the tourism industry
benefits from the continued NPS protection of the superlative resources of its national parks, unimpaired.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The majority of flights conducted by helicopter companies in Hawaii are commercial air tour/sightseeing operations.
Both the NPS and FAA have received numerous complaints of commercial air sightseeing tour flights over residential
communities, national parks, wildlife refuge areas, State natural reserve areas, sanctuaries and areas of significant
historic or cultural value. Issues raised by the growth of air tour sightseeing activity and the associated increase
in the number of flights conducted over a given area include aircraft noise, flight noise, flight safety, and airport
site constraints near scenic areas. It may be necessary to determine if there are thresholds of adverse effects that

The FAA has taken several steps to address the overflight issues in Hawaii. In 1986, the FAA conducted a study of helicopter
sightseeing operations in Hawaii. As a result of that study, recommendations were made to the State and to operators
in Hawaii to improve safety and community relations. Also in 1986, the FAA conducted a joint study with the State on
heliport and airport access. A result of that study was a helicopter operating plan for Hawaii. Numerous meetings
have since been held with NPS personnel, industry, and local communities, including four public meetings conducted
in January 1994.

Impacts to Parks and Their Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At some parks, including Grand Canyon National Park, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, and Haleakala National Park,
the temporal and spatial extent of commercial air tours are, in the judgment of NPS managers, impairing park resources
and visitor experience. While the NPS and FAA are interested in evaluating potential solutions to the problems at
these parks, they are also seeking solutions that will make it possible to avert problems in the future throughout
the national park system as have developed at these parks.

Cultural Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Very limited information is available on the response of structures to subsonic aircraft and helicopters. The greatest
potential risk to historic structures and cultural resources in units of the national park system is from helicopters.
The noise characteristics of helicopters are such that they tend to excite nearby structural elements at their resonance
frequency, causing low frequency vibrations, rattle, and in some cases, damage. The sound pressure is greatest at
structures in the plane of the main rotor, such as could be the case for a helicopter approaching cliff dwellings. When
representative cultural resources were reviewed for probability of damage, most were found to be at some risk from
commercial air sightseeing tours. Mesa Verde (Colorado) and Canyonlands National Parks (Utah), among others, protest
fragile prehistoric stone and adobe structures, including granaries and cliff dwellings, as well as associated
cultural materials that are susceptible to damage from helicopter-induced noise and rotor wash. The cultural and
spiritual values commemorated in units of the national park system like San Antonio Missions National Historical
Parks and the battlefields of the Civil War can be wholly lost by frequent and intrusive commercial air sightseeing
tour overflights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As further examples of areas impacted by aircraft overflights, Mount Rushmore National Memorial and the Statue of
Liberty National Monument are cultural icons that can be adversely affected in significant ways be commercial air
tour overflights. At the Statue of Liberty, an impending aircraft service would take off and land helicopters from
a floating raft less than one-half mile from the statue. This service would be added to two existing commercial sightseeing
helicopter operators that account for 115 flights per day and a service that operates four fixed-wing aircraft on
air tours. Similarly, the experience of Mount Rushmore National Memorial for the visitors on the ground can be irretrievably
lost as a consequence of the aircraft flights close to memorial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A comprehensive study of the adverse effects of commercial air sightseeing tours on wildlife in parks has yet to be
concluded. Studies to date indicate that aircraft can be associated with stress responses on a number of animals,
including migratory birds. Endangered species, like the grizzly bear in Glacier National Park, can be harassed by
commercial air tour operators unaware of the potential adverse effects of flying too close to them. Other mammals
like desert bighorn sheep, dear, and elk that have found refuge in parks can be panicked and stressed by low-flying
aircraft, as well. No studies that evaluate long-term effects on wildlife, including population level impacts of
commercial air sightseeing tours, have been conducted. As with any potential impact associated with activities
in parks, the NPS policy is to err on the side of resource protection until conclusive information is available that
would indicate otherwise.

Assessing Noise Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is working with the NPS to define acceptable noise levels as the basis for any proposed limitations on aircraft
overflights. This process involves identifying areas with the highest levels of noise sensitivity. Highly sensitive
areas potentially would be subject to lower noise limits than would apply to other areas with higher ambient noise
levels, based on resource values, types of use, or other factors. Depending on local conditions, alternative approaches
may be employed in different areas to achieve the same noise goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current FAA policy and guidelines designate the yearly day-night average sound level (DNL) as the single noise metric
for measuring aviation impacts on people in and around airports. This traditional metric alone may not be appropriate
for assessing aviation noise impacts in parks and wilderness areas. Three supplemental metrics other than DNL are
proven and appear particularly suitable for site-specific assessments. These are Equivalent Sound Level (L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
eq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), Sound Exposure Level (SEL) and Time Above a dBA Threshold (TA). Additionally, defining a change of 5 dB as significant
at any initial DNL level may be appropriate for specifying further noise analysis in parks and wilderness areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ongoing NPS studies have identified two potential (dose-response relationships that also may be appropriate
for assessing aircraft noise impacts. These are ``Annoyance vs. Percent Time Heard'' and ``Interference with Quiet
vs. Percent Time Heard.'' These relationships are preliminary and must be subjected to rigorous analysis for further
determination of their potential application.

Policy Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reviewing potential alternatives for achieving NPS and FAA purposes, the FAA has considered a number of measures
within its authority under the FAAct that would have the potential to address the problems identified by the NPS. In
determining whether a particular action would be beneficial for this purpose and otherwise feasible, the FAA and
NPS must take into account a number of legal and policy considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action, if regulatory, must be consistent with Administration rulemaking principles as set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866. These principles include requirements that regulations be drafted in the most cost-effective
manner to achieve the objective; that regulations be based on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical,
economic, and other information concerning the need for and consequences of the action to be taken; and that regulations
be tailored to impose the least burden on society, including individuals, businesses, and communities, consistent
with obtaining the regulatory objective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action must have no adverse effect on aviation safety. The action should have the minimum possible adverse effect
on the efficiency of air navigation, consistent with the regulatory objective, and should not unduly burden interstate
commerce. It must also meet NPS requirements for protecting resources, assuring that there is no impairment, and
that there is no derogation, to park resources and values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action should focus directly on the problem rather than indirectly. For example, if the issue is the adverse impacts
of overflights of a unit of the national park system, then the agency action will address those overflights directly,
rather than seek to influence them through regulation of takeoffs and landings at a nearby airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Options for Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA and NPS believe that each of the following measures may have some utility, in certain circumstances, as a measure
to mitigate the adverse effects of commercial air sightseeing tour overflights of units of the national park system.
Inasmuch as some of the measures have not been used before, neither the FAA nor NPS has concluded that such actions would
meet the legal and policy considerations summarized above, and specific comment is requested on the benefits, costs,
and impacts of each.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Voluntary Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Voluntary, non-regulatory measures that mitigate noise impacts would impose the minimum burden on operators and
can be effective. An example is the recommended minimum altitude of 2,000 feet above ground level described in FAA
Advisory Circular 91&hyph;36C, which is honored by most transient operators. Another option would be expansion
of the existing Interagency Agreement among the FAA, the NPS, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land
Management. Through that agreement the proponents agree to assess severe situations where impact of aircraft operations
upon human, cultural, or natural resources are sufficiently serious to warrant consideration of site-specific
action by the FAA to minimize or eliminate the causes of such problems. Expansion of the Interagency Agreement could
provide for additional non-regulatory actions by the agencies to mitigate overflight impacts. The agencies seek
comments on the relative merits of voluntary measures generally, and specific suggestions for other voluntary measures
not currently used by the FAA or NPS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Grand Canyon Model
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One option is to follow a model similar to that in use at Grand Canyon, with extensive regulation of airspace, routes,
and minimum altitudes as discussed separately below. Such an approach may not adequately consider the fact that the
total number and frequency of flights, and the steady growth in numbers of flights, are not currently addressed under
that regulatory framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Prohibition of Flights During Flight-Free Time Periods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A prohibition could be established on use of some or all of the airspace above parks at certain times; e.g., 1 hour per
day, 1 day per week, or 2&hyph;4 weeks per year. The ``quiet times'' would be published well in advance both for air tour
operator scheduling and for planning by park visitors. In terms of noise mitigation, non-flying quiet periods would
present an unusual approach to the balance between air access and the interest in restoring some degree of the natural
quiet in Grand Canyon National Park. At some cost in inconvenience and lost business for air tour operators and temporarily
reduced access to air tours for their passengers, the park would enjoy a virtual absence of aircraft noise in sensitive
areas for specific periods. The agencies specifically request comment on the potential efficacy of these approaches
in meeting FAA and NPS goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Altitude Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 at Grand Canyon currently specifies a minimum altitude for flight over the different areas of the
park as high as 14,500 feet msl. It also specifies minimum altitudes for operation in the flight corridors between
the flight-free zones. Different altitudes are specified for transient general aviation operations and for air
tour operators, to separate high-frequency tour flights from one-time transient flights. Different altitudes
are also specified for fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter tour flights, for safety and efficiency reasons. The tour
operation altitudes are at canyon rim level or above (although some are slightly below the minimum altitude requested
by NPS as ``rim level'' in 1987). A relatively high minimum altitude in a particular area limits access to the airspace
over that area by many general aviation aircraft because of performance limitations. Generally, noise mitigation
is achieved through higher minimum altitudes because the greater the slant-range distance from an aircraft to a point
on the surface, the lower the sound level on the surface from aircraft noise. However, this mitigation can be offset
or reversed based on attenuation factors such as hills, heavily wooded areas, and ``soft ground'' terrain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Flight Free Zones/Flight Corridors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 at Grand Canyon now describes specific ``flight-free'' zones to an altitude of 14,500 feet msl
above the park. The remaining airspace is defined as corridors for operations over the park by both general aviation
and commercial air tour operators. Impact mitigation is achieved through specifying corridors for flight over the
park that assure there are no overflights of large areas of the park below the current minimum altitude of 14,500 feet
msl. The current corridors and flight-free zones could be amended to address concerns about effects on particular
areas of the park.

Restrictions on Noise Through Allocation of Aircraft Noise Equivalencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A noise budget is a mechanism for limiting total aircraft noise impact on the park by assigning each air tour operator
an individual limit on noise impact. This would allow individual air tour operators the flexibility to decide what
combination of equipment and flight frequency they will use to attain the target noise level. The noise budget would
apply only to air tour sightseeing operators and not to transient general aviation operations. The noise budget concept
assumes that the FAA and NPS could determine (1) the acceptable amount of aircraft noise exposure on the park surface,
and (2) the number of aircraft operations under various mixes of aircraft types that could operate within the total
noise budget.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While complex to develop and administer, the noise budget could achieve noise mitigation through directly addressing
the issue of noise impact but would not address the impacts other than noise. Once the ``budget'' is established based
on target noise levels in various areas of the park, air tour operators would have substantial flexibility to adjust
their business operations without exceeding those levels. The noise budget could act as a practical limit on the amount
of aviation activity, but would not impose limits on the number of operations. A noise budget would also represent
an incentive for operators to acquire relatively quiet aircraft to avoid a penalty on the number of operations that
could be conducted within each operator's target noise level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual allocations under a noise budget could be established by designating maximum noise levels for each operator.
This could be done by ``grandfathering'' the current noise contribution by each air tour operator, or by some other
administrative means.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Incentives To Encourage Use of Quiet Aircraft
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air tour operators could be encouraged to use relatively quiet aircraft on park overflights. For example, a flight
corridor with a good scenic view of the canyon could be limited to aircraft meeting certain noise emission standards.
An air tour operator could find it advantageous to convert its entire fleet to such quiet aircraft to incorporate that
corridor in its tours. While there is no Federal requirement for aircraft to be manufactured to produce less noise
than Stage 3 standards, some aircraft appropriate for air tour operations are quieter than Stage 3. Increased use
of such aircraft in air tours would achieve noise mitigation through reducing noise levels on the surface of the park,
although this option does not address issues other than noise.

The FAA and NPS solicit comments and information from all segments of the public interested in aviation and national
parks and their relationship. The primary focus of this advance notice is commercial air sightseeing tours, rather
than military or general aviation operations. It is anticipated that any regulations eventually developed would
be general in nature and applicable to the entire national park system. It is not the intent of the NPS or FAA to develop
regulations specific to any one park at this time. However, examples of aviation activities observed in one park may
be used to support an opinion on overall aviation management issues.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is publishing for comment proposed amendments
to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), which would make it unlawful for
a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer to act as an underwriter of an issue of municipal securities unless
the broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent
has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide
certain information to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository; or to recommend the
purchase or sale of a municipal security, without having reviewed the information the issuer of the municipal security
has undertaken to provide. The purpose of the proposed amendments is to further deter fraud and manipulation in the
municipal securities market by prohibiting the underwriting and subsequent recommendation of securities for which
adequate information is not available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a recent report to Congress,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 the staff of the Division of Market Regulation (``Staff'') reviewed many aspects of the municipal securities market,
including whether opportunities exist for overreaching and investor deception. The Staff found that investors
need sufficient current information about issuers and significant obligors to better protect themselves from fraud
and manipulation, to better evaluate offering prices, to decide which municipal securities to buy, and to decide
when to sell.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, the Staff found that the growing participation of individuals as both direct and indirect purchasers of
municipal securities underscores the need for sound recommendations by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities
dealers.

Based on these findings, the Staff recommended that the Commission use its interpretive authority to provide guidance
regarding the disclosure required by the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Today, in a companion release,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission is interpreting the disclosure obligations of municipal securities issuers. The Companion Release
also addresses the obligations under the antifraud provisions of brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers
who underwrite and sell municipal securities, and the information dissemination requirements of Rule 15c2&hyph;12.

Act Release No. 26985 (June 28, 1989), 54 FR 28799 (``Adopting Release''). Rule 15c2&hyph;12 requires an underwriter
of municipal securities (1) to obtain and review an issuer's official statement that, except for certain information,
is ``deemed final'' by an issuer, prior to making a purchase, offer, or sale of municipal securities; (2) in negotiated
sales, to provide the issuer's most recent preliminary official statement (if one exists) to potential customers;
(3) to deliver to customers, upon request, copies of the final official statement for a specified period of time; and
(4) to contract to receive, within a specified time, sufficient copies of the issuer's final official statement to
comply with the rule's delivery requirement, and the requirements of MSRB rules. Rule 15c2&hyph;12 also contains
specific exemptions for three types of municipal securities offerings.

 This section specifically authorizes the Commission to promulgate rules and regulations to define, and prescribe
means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices. Pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted

The Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to further deter fraud and manipulation in the primary and secondary
municipal securities markets by prohibiting the underwriting and subsequent recommendation of securities for
which adequate information is not available.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 For many years, the courts and the Commission have emphasized that, under the antifraud provisions, a broker-dealer
recommending securities to investors implies by its recommendation that it has an adequate basis for making the recommendation.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 In the Proposing Release and the Adopting Release, the Commission discussed broker-dealers' obligation to have
a reasonable belief in the accuracy of statements made when underwriting securities.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 When recommendations in the secondary market are made, they must be based on information that is up-to-date and accessible.

Under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, issuer disclosure not only must be accurate in all
material respects, but also must not omit information necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances,
not misleading. The proposed amendment will assist issuers in satisfying their obligations under the antifraud
provisions by creating a mechanism for the dissemination of primary and secondary market disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 will assist brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in
satisfying their obligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and specifically under
section 15(c)(2), by conditioning the underwriting and recommendation of municipal securities on the availability
of current issuer information. By providing an efficient and timely means of access to disclosure, the proposed amendments
will ensure that information will be available in the future regarding underwritten securities. As a result, brokers,
dealers, and municipal securities dealers will be better able to recommend municipal securities in the secondary
market based on current issuer information. Fraud and manipulation in both the primary and secondary markets for
municipal securities thus will be deterred. Furthermore, the availability of secondary market disclosure to all
municipal securities market participants will assist investors in protecting themselves from misrepresentation
or other fraudulent activities by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal
securities dealer (``Participating Underwriter'')
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with a primary offering of municipal securities with
an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more (``Offering'')
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken
in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information
to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository (``NRMSIR''). The prohibition would apply
to underwriters that have committed contractually to act as an underwriter in an Offering on or after the effective
date of the rule amendment. This proposal responds, in part, to a suggestion in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 in which a broad spectrum of municipal securities market participants supported wider dissemination of issuer information
and improved mechanisms for such dissemination, to assure that securities professionals have a sufficient factual
basis on which to recommend secondary market transactions.

The Commission is proposing further to amend Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities
dealers, prior to recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security, to review the information the issuer
of the municipal security has undertaken to provide. This amendment would apply to municipal securities issued on
or after the effective date of the proposed amendment discussed in the preceding paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed amendments would define the term ``significant obligor,'' and amend the definition of the
term ``final official statement'' for purposes of Rule 15c2&hyph;12.

A. Underwriting Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One amendment proposed today would add paragraph (b)(5) to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. This paragraph would prohibit a Participating
Underwriter from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with an Offering, unless the Participating
Underwriter has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken in a written agreement
or contract for the benefit of holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information to a NRMSIR. In
using the terms ``purchase'' or ``sale,'' the proposed amendment contemplates that, at such time as the issuer of
municipal securities delivers the securities to the Participating Underwriters, the issuer will have undertaken,
in a written contract or agreement for the benefit of holders of the municipal securities, to provide information
to a NRMSIR.

A Participating Underwriter would need to receive assurances from the issuer that such undertakings would be made
before agreeing to act as an underwriter.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the exception of general obligation bonds, most offerings include a trust indenture which sets forth the undertakings
between the issuer and the holders of municipal securities, and thus delineates the bondholders' rights. If there
is no trust indenture, as in a general obligation bond offering, a bond resolution, ordinance, or written agreement
or contract sets out the undertakings by the issuer for the benefit of the holders of the municipal securities. In order
to satisfy its obligation under the rule, a Participating Underwriter would need to look to these documents for undertakings
by the issuer to supply secondary market disclosure to a NRMSIR. A Participating Underwriter will have satisfied
its obligation under proposed paragraph (b)(5), so long as it can conclude that all of the appropriate undertakings
have been made. While the issuer's duty will be to its bondholders, all participants in the municipal securities market
will benefit from having access to this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested on the use of a written agreement or contract for the provision of secondary market information
by issuers for the benefit of holders of municipal securities, particularly in light of the provisions of proposed
paragraph (c) prohibiting the recommendation by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers of municipal
securities when issuer information is unavailable. Comments should address specifically the consequences of a
failure by an issuer to comply with its secondary market disclosure undertakings after the initial issuance of municipal
securities. Comment is requested on whether the use of the issuer's undertakings is a necessary or appropriate approach
to implementing procedures for providing information to the municipal securities market. Comment also is requested
on whether, as an alternative to written undertakings, a statement in the final official statement of the issuer of
municipal securities that it will provide secondary market disclosure would be sufficient. In addition, commenters
are requested to address whether the use of written undertakings provides sufficient flexibility for issuers that,
in the future, wish to change the type, timing, or presentation of the information, or whether some alternative mechanism
should be used.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Annual Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) would prohibit Participating Underwriters from purchasing or selling municipal
securities in connection with an Offering unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that
the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken to provide to a NRMSIR, at least annually, current financial information
concerning the issuer of the municipal security and any significant obligors, including annual audited financial
statements and pertinent operating information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current annual financial information is an important source of updated information for the market. The format for
presenting such information is not specified in the proposed amendment, and may be accomplished through any disclosure
document, whatever its form or principal purpose, that includes annual audited financial statements and pertinent
operating information. The proposed amendment contemplates that sequential final official statements prepared
by frequent issuers of municipal securities may meet the standards of the rule. Similarly, the audited financial
statements should fairly present the current financial condition, the results of operations, and cash flows of the
municipal issuer and any significant obligor. Proposed paragraph (b)(5) also does not dictate the content of the
annual financial information, other than the audited financial statements. Rather, it provides discretion to offering
participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that there is great diversity in the municipal marketplace, both in terms of the types of
issuers and the types of issues of municipal securities. The proposed amendment is, therefore, intended to permit
issuers the flexibility to address the needs of the market by specifying in the written agreement or contract the particular
financial and operating information that is to be provided on an annual basis, in addition to the annual audited financial
statements. The Commission anticipates that issuers and offering participants will look to various voluntary guidelines,
as well as the guidance provided in the Companion Release, in establishing an appropriate level of disclosure for
each municipal securities issue. Of course, additional information, such as unaudited quarterly information,
also could be specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed amendment, in paragraph (b)(5)(ii), the issuer of the municipal security also would be required
to specify what accounting principles will be used in the preparation of the audited financial statements, the time
within which the annual information for each year will be available, and the specific operating and financial information
that will be provided on an annual basis, in addition to the audited financial statements. The covenant would not limit
the issuer in its ability to supplement the specific information, where necessary or appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(5)(ii) does not specify the timing of availability of the annual financial information in
each year. Rather, any written contract or agreement would be required to specify the annual time frame in which the
current financial information covering the previous fiscal year will be provided by the issuer of the municipal security
and any significant obligors. As noted above, this permits issuers some flexibility in disseminating this information,
and also allows investors and the marketplace to know when such information will be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested on whether the rule should specify the minimum content of the information to be provided on an
annual basis. Comment is requested on whether audited financial statements should be required, and whether they
should be required to be audited using GAAS. Comment also is requested on whether the financial statements should
be required to conform to generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') or should include discussions of
material deviations from GAAP if prepared on some other basis. Further, comment is requested on whether the rule should
specify the time frame, such as six months or nine months after the fiscal year end, in which the annual financial information
should be made available in each year.

This portion of the proposed amendment, like that addressing annual financial information, is intended to provide
guidance to issuers and other participants in the municipal securities market regarding the dissemination of notices
of material events. As discussed in the Companion Release,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 this list consists of recognized material events that reflect on the creditworthiness of the issuer of the municipal
security or any significant obligor, as well as on the terms of the securities they issue. The issuer must determine
whether information needs to be disseminated about a listed event in any particular situation, and if so, when the
information dissemination should occur in order to be ``timely.'' For example, an issuer would be free to determine
that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
draw on a reserve fund by an issuer financing agency resulting from a delay by the obligor in transmitting a payment,
where the draw is replaced immediately and is not the result of the obligor's financial difficulties, is not a material
event requiring notice to the market.

be specified as part of the undertaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Recommendations Without Specified Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, a new paragraph (c) would be added to the rule, which would prohibit any broker, dealer, or municipal securities
dealer from recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security unless such broker, dealer, or municipal securities
dealer has reviewed the information the issuer of such municipal security has undertaken to provide pursuant to paragraph
(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, broker-dealers imply by recommending securities that they have a reasonable basis for making such
recommendations. In the Commission's view, most situations in which a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer
brings a municipal security to the attention of a customer involve an implicit recommendation of the security to the
customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment neither specifies the form in which information must be reviewed, nor specifies which documents
must be obtained.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rather, it requires brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers to review the information that the issuer
of the municipal security has agreed to provide. The proposed amendment is intended to allow this information to be
obtained and reviewed through any means of dissemination used by participants in the municipal securities market.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the information may be available from documents placed in a NRMSIR, this may not be the only source of information.
Thus, to satisfy the requirements of the rule, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers may obtain this
information directly from the issuer, from professionals such as attorneys, accountants, or other municipal securities
dealers, or from any other reliable source. If, in reviewing this information, they discover any factors that suggest
that disclosure is inaccurate or incomplete, or that signal the need for additional investigation, brokers, dealers,
and municipal securities dealers may need to obtain additional information, or seek to verify existing information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If, however, the rating is known and information placed with a NRMSIR has been reviewed and raises no questions, a broker,
dealer, or municipal securities dealer would need to look no further for information about the security recommended.
Furthermore, a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer would not be prohibited from recommending the purchase
or sale of a municipal security solely because of the existence of material events of which, after its review, it has
no knowledge. This could occur if an issuer failed to disclose the occurrence of a material event to a NRMSIR or to disseminate
notice of such an occurrence in any other manner. Under paragraph (c), if the specified information is not available,
no recommendation may be made.

on a review of this information, have a reasonable basis under the circumstances for believing that the information
is accurate in all material respects, and that the sources of the information are reliable. Submissions of quotations
respecting municipal securities are exempt from the application of Rule 15c2&hyph;11. Rule 15c2&hyph;11(f)(4).

In view of the importance of ensuring the secondary market liquidity of municipal issues, comment also is requested
on whether market participants believe that the proposed amendments would have a substantial or long-lasting effect
on market liquidity. Questions have been raised about whether municipal securities dealers will be willing to effect
secondary market transactions in a broad range of municipal securities in light of the specificity with which the
requirement of paragraph (c) is articulated. The Commission is of the view that once the proposed amendments are in
effect, and dissemination systems are operating, liquidity will not be affected, and that municipal securities
dealers will be willing and able to purchase and sell as broad a range of securities as before. Commenters should consider
this analysis and suggest any factors that may have effects on liquidity, and what operational changes or repository
arrangements, or changes to the proposed amendment to the rule, would reduce these effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 15c2&hyph;12(e)(3) presently defines the term ``final official statement'' as a document or set of documents
prepared by the issuer or its representatives setting forth information concerning the issuer and the securities
to be issued that is complete as of the date the document is delivered to the Participating Underwriter. The definition
does not prescribe the specific information required to be included in the documents. In order to ensure that the purposes
of Rule 15c2&hyph;12 are met, and in light of the proposed amendment obligating Participating Underwriters to assure
that issuers have undertaken to provide to a repository issuer-identified minimum annual financial information,
as well as notices of material events, the Commission is proposing to amend the definition of final official statement
to include an information requirement. The definition of final official statement also governs the items of information

The proposed amendment would define the final official statement to include information concerning the terms of
the proposed issue of securities, and financial and operating information concerning the issuer that is adequate
to provide a fair presentation of the issuer's current financial condition and results of operations and cash flows,
including audited financial statements. Financial and operating information also would be required for any ``significant
obligor'' with respect to the municipal security. The term ``significant obligor'' is defined in the proposed amendment,
and is discussed below. As discussed in the Companion Release, reliable financial information, prepared on a consistent
basis, that fairly presents the issuer's and any significant obligor's financial position, is an important component
of a disclosure scheme designed to prevent fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested on whether an amendment to the definition of final official statement is necessary. If commenters
consider amendment necessary, comment is requested on whether audited financial statements should be required,
whether audited financial statements should be required to be audited using GAAS, the number of years of audited financial
statements that should be included, if any, and if audited financial statements are included, whether unaudited
financial statements covering interim periods also should be included. Comment also is requested on whether the
definition should be amended to require that the financial statements conform to GAAP, or should include discussions
of material deviations from GAAP if prepared on some other basis.

The final official statement can be composed of a set of documents. Comment is requested on whether a seasoned issuer
should be permitted to incorporate previously prepared documents by reference into the final official statement
and, if incorporation by reference is permitted, what limitations or requirements should be imposed. Comment is
requested on whether seasoned issuers should be required to provide documents incorporated by reference upon request
and at no charge, and on what definition should be used for ``seasoned issuers.'' For example, seasoned issuers could
be defined as repeat issuers having in excess of a specified dollar amount of outstanding securities.

2. Significant Obligors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(5) of the amendment would require financial and operating information on ``significant
obligors'' of an issuer of a municipal security to be provided in the final official statement and in annual financial
information. The proposed amendments, in paragraph (f)(9), also would define the term ``significant obligor.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An obligor is any person who, directly or indirectly, under a lease, loan, sale, or other agreement or arrangement,
is obligated to make payments to the issuer, which cash payments are the source of the cash flow servicing the obligations
on municipal securities. The term ``obligor'' is not limited to issuers of separate securities under Rule 3b&hyph;5
under the Exchange Act and Rule 131 under the Securities Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the proposed definition, an obligor would be viewed as ``significant'' if it is the source of 20 percent or more
of the cash flow servicing the obligations on the municipal securities.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This definition is designed to make available to the municipal securities market, at the time of issuance and on an
annual basis, information on persons who ultimately are responsible for the cash flow servicing the municipal securities.
The proposed definition recognizes that, with portfolio and concentration risk diversification, the ``significant
obligor'' of an issuer of a municipal security may not be constant, but may change from year to year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested on whether 20 percent is an appropriate threshold level of cash flow to require disclosure concerning
a significant obligor, or whether a different threshold, such as 10, 15, or 30 percent, should be used. Comment also
is requested on whether this standard should differ for a final official statement and annual financial information.
Finally, comment is requested as to whether the issuer's obligation to provide information concerning significant
obligors should be conditioned on a minimum threshold, for example, payment obligations in excess of $1,000,000,
or some other dollar threshold.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Exemptions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with other provisions of Rule 15c2&hyph;12, the proposed amendments are limited in application to primary
offerings of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments include a new exemption in paragraph (d)(2), applicable to paragraph (b)(5). This new exemption
would provide that, in addition to the $1,000,000 threshold applicable to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 generally, Offerings
would be exempt from the operation of paragraph (b)(5) if, at such time as the issuer of municipal securities delivers
the securities to the Participating Underwriter, the issuer: (a) will have less than $10,000,000 in aggregate amount
of municipal securities outstanding, including the offered securities; and (b) the issuer will have issued less
than $3,000,000 in aggregate amount of municipal securities in the most recent 48 months preceding the Offering.
This exemption is designed to exclude from the application of paragraph (b)(5) small issuers that do not frequently
issue municipal securities. Comment is requested on the use of these thresholds. Comment also is requested on whether
a different or additional threshold should be applicable to paragraph (b)(5). Such a threshold could be based on the
number of holders of municipal securities, or on the number of holders falling below a certain level at the end of a fiscal
year, for example, 300 or 500 debt holders. Comment is requested on whether issuers of conduit securities that are
non-governmental private activity bonds should be excepted from this exemption, or if lower or different thresholds
should be used for such issuers. Comment also is requested on whether the exemption in proposed paragraph (d)(2) is
appropriate for conduit financings, in light of the fact that, in many instances, issuing authorities are created
for the sole purpose of issuing bonds to finance a particular facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments also include a new exemption in paragraph (d)(3), exempting from the application of paragraph
(c) of the rule a primary offering of municipal securities (1) not sold in an Offering to which paragraph (b)(5) applied,
or (2) sold in an Offering exempt under paragraph (d)(1) or paragraph (d)(2). The purpose of this exemption is to permit
the recommendation in the secondary market of securities that were not subject to paragraph (b)(5), either because
they were sold in a primary offering of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of less than $1,000,000,
or because they came within the existing exemptions under newly designated paragraph (d)(1) for limited placements,
short-term securities, and securities with demand features, or within the exemption in new paragraph (d)(2) for
small, infrequent issuers. Comment is requested on this exemption. Specifically, comment is requested on whether
paragraph (c) of the proposed amendments should be made applicable to all outstanding issues of municipal securities.
The existing transactional exemption in newly designated paragraph (d) would apply to the amendments.

E. Transitional Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Newly designated paragraph (g) of the rule would contain a transitional provision for the proposed amendments. The
provisions of paragraph (b)(5) would apply to a Participating Underwriter that had contractually committed to act
as an underwriter in an Offering on or after the effective date of the rule. Comment is requested on whether this transitional
provision is appropriate, and on whether the effective date of the proposed amendments should be delayed.

While the term ``NRMSIR'' currently is used in paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 15c2&hyph;12, it is not defined in the rule.

securities disclosure documents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the MSRB announced its intention to establish and manage a central repository to provide for the collection
and dissemination of official statements and refunding documents. Letter from John W. Rowe, Chairman, MSRB, to Jonathan
G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 1, 1989). The MSRB developed its Municipal Securities Information Library (``MSIL'')
system, which presently collects information and disseminates it electronically to market participants and information
vendors. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29298 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28194.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In January 1993, the MSRB began operating its Continuing Disclosure Information pilot system (``CDI System''),
which is a central repository for voluntarily submitted official continuing disclosure documents relating to outstanding
municipal securities issues. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30556 (April 6, 1992), 57 FR 12534. The CDI System
operates as part of MSIL, and currently is capable of accepting documents of three or fewer pages in length.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither MSIL nor the CDI System is a NRMSIR. In considering the approval of MSRB rule G&hyph;36, which requires underwriters
to provide the MSRB with copies of final official statements and certain other information prepared by issuers, the
Commission noted that the MSRB did not intend to seek NRMSIR status. The Commission noted that if the MSRB sought NRMSIR
status, it would consider the competitive implications of such a request. See Securities Exchange Act Release No.
28081 (June 1, 1990), 55 FR 23333, 23337 n.26.

NRMSIRs were discussed in the Adopting Release, where the Commission noted that in determining whether a particular
entity is a NRMSIR, it would look, among other things, at whether the repository: (1) Is national in scope; (2) maintains
current, accurate information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements; (3) has effective retrieval
and dissemination systems; (4) places no limits on the issuers from which it will accept official statements or related
information; (5) provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable
fees; and (6) charges reasonable fees.

Joint Statement

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
suggested that in order to be recognized as a NRMSIR, a repository should, among other things: (1) maintain current,
accurate information about municipal securities in the form of annual financial reports, operating data, and other
current information; (2) have an effective retrieval and dissemination system; (3) place no limits on the issuers
from which it will accept information unless it is a single-state repository; (4) provide access to the documents
to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fee; (5) charge reasonable fees; (6) collect information on at least
a state-wide basis; and (7) provide for timely notification to an MSRB index of names of issuers about which it is to
receive information.

The proposed amendments do not define the term NRMSIR. The Commission requests comment on whether NRMSIR should be
defined in the rule, with specific standards established for NRMSIRs. If standards were established, the Commission
believes the following standards are appropriate. It requests comment on these standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRMSIRs should maintain current, accurate information about municipal securities, including final official statements,
the issuers' annual financial information, and issuers' notices of material events. Moreover, NRMSIRs should have
effective systems for the timely collection, indexing, storage, and retrieval of these documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRMSIRs should be capable of national dissemination of final official statements, annual financial information,
and notices of material events through electronic dissemination systems, in response to telephone inquiries, and
hard copy delivery via facsimile, by mail, and by messenger service. Specific dissemination systems and standards
should be delineated in order to emphasize the importance of effective information dissemination. Timely public
availability upon receipt of information by a NRMSIR also is important. For example, final official statements and
annual financial information could be made available by the next business day after their receipt by a NRMSIR, and
notices of material events could be made available within fifteen minutes of their receipt by a NRMSIR. Comment is
requested on the provision by NRMSIRs of electronic dissemination of information, and on the suggested timing requirements
for availability of documents for dissemination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repositories created and operated by states would be required to accept submissions from all issuers within their
own states, and would not be permitted to accept documents from issuers in any other state. National dissemination
requirements, however, would be applicable to single-state repositories. All other repositories would not be permitted
to limit the issuers from which they will accept final official statements, annual financial information, and reports
of material events. Comment is requested on whether state-based repositories can serve as an effective means to disseminate
information to the market for a nationally traded security, so the issuer of that security can meet its disclosure
obligations using a state-based repository. Comment also is requested on whether a significant number of states
are willing to make the necessary financial commitment to create a state-based system. NRMSIRs would not be permitted
to discriminate on the basis of the requestor in providing documents, and would be required to charge reasonable fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in order to implement the indexing system suggested by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Joint Statement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a NRMSIR would be required to provide notice to the MSRB of its designation by an issuer as the repository for the issuer's
final official statements, annual financial information, and notices of material events. This would allow the creation
of an index by the MSRB for informing the municipal securities market of where an issuer is sending its secondary market
disclosure. Comment is requested on the feasibility of expanding this provision to require a NRMSIR to inform the
MSRB whenever it receives information from an issuer. Comment also is requested on whether documents should be required
to be placed with the MSRB either in addition to or in lieu of a NRMSIR.

Furthermore, comment is requested as to whether designation by Commission order, pursuant to standards set out in
Rule 15c2&hyph;12, is an appropriate method for recognizing NRMSIRs, or whether it is appropriate to continue the
current no-action policies of the Division.

IV. Application of the Tower Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the passage of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (``1975 Amendments''), Congress provided for a limited
regulatory scheme for municipal securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to the passage of the 1975 Amendments, municipal issuers were exempt from the registration and continuous reporting
provisions of both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. While municipal issuers continued to be exempt from all
but the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the 1975 Amendments required the registration of municipal
securities brokers and dealers,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and established the MSRB,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 granting it the authority to promulgate rules governing the sale of municipal securities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In so crafting the 1975 Amendments, Congress struck a balance between investor protection and intergovernmental
comity. This concern is reflected in Section 15B(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits the MSRB from requiring
``any issuer of municipal securities, directly or indirectly through a purchaser or prospective purchaser of securities
from the issuer, to file with the Commission or the Board prior to the sale of such securities by the issuer any application,
report, or document, in connection with the issuance, sale, or distribution of such securities.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Congress was careful to preserve the authority of the Commission under Section 15(c)(2) of the Exchange Act.

&hyph;4(d)(2) to the Exchange Act, prohibits the MSRB from requiring municipal issuers, directly or indirectly,
through municipal securities broker-dealers or otherwise, to furnish the MSRB or prospective investors with any
documents, including official statements. The MSRB specifically is permitted, however, to require that official
statements or other documents that are available from sources other than the issuer, such as the underwriter, be provided
to investors.

 Congress expanded the Commission's authority to adopt rules reasonably designed to prevent fraud. The Commission
believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 are consistent with its Congressional mandate to adopt
rules reasonably designed to prevent fraud in the municipal securities market.

V. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, to consider the anticompetitive effects of those rules,
if any, and to balance that impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the
Exchange Act. The Commission preliminarily is of the view that adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12
would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act. The Commission requests comment, however, on any competitive burdens that might result from amendment of the
rule. Moreover, while the amendments apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers, the
Commission is interested in receiving comments on the extent to which the proposed dollar threshold in the new exemption
in paragraph (e) would burden one segment of the industry more than another.

In addition, the Commission has prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (``IRFA''), pursuant to the
requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regarding the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. The IRFA indicates that the amendments to the rule could
impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers and municipal issuers. Nonetheless, the Commission is of the
view that many of the substantive requirements of the rule amendments already are observed by broker-dealers and
issuers as a matter of business practice, or to fulfill their existing obligations under the general antifraud provisions
of the federal securities laws. The Commission requests comment on the extent to which current practice deviates
from the requirements of the proposed amendments, and the extent to which additional costs may be imposed on small
broker-dealers and municipal issuers if the amendments are adopted as proposed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is publishing for comment amendments to Rule 10b-10 and proposed Rule 15c2&hyph;13
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 are designed to clarify the operation
of the Rule, particularly in light of changes in the securities markets and the development of new securities products.
The amendments and new rule are designed to enhance the disclosure given to customers so that customers can better
evaluate their securities transactions. The Commission is seeking comment on the function of the confirmation in
the context of a three day settlement period, and the adequacy and readability of customer periodic statements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') proposes to amend the confirmation requirements
under Rule 10b-10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to strengthen its investor protection function. Generally, Rule 10b-10 requires a broker-dealer that effects transactions
for customers in securities, other than U.S. Savings Bonds or municipal securities, to provide a written notification
to the customer, at or before completion of the transaction, that discloses information about the transaction.

A broker-dealer has an obligation under Rule 10b-10 to send its customers an immediate confirmation with respect
to each transaction the broker-dealer effects. In the case of a customer account managed by a fiduciary of the customer,
it is important to note that the account is the customer, rather than the fiduciary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See generally Letter regarding Merrill Lynch, Broadcort Capital Corp. and Wagner Stott Clearing Corp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 (March 25, 1991)[available on LEXIS]. Accordingly, under Rule 10b-10, a broker-dealer must send an immediate confirmation
to the account holder, in addition to any confirmation it may send to an account fiduciary. The Commission believes,
however, that an account that has given discretionary authority in writing to its fiduciary may agree in writing with
the broker-dealer effecting its trades to waive the receipt of an immediate confirmation required by Rule 10b-10
if: (1) The broker-dealer sends an immediate confirmation to the account's fiduciary, and (2) a broker-dealer sends
the discretionary account a statement no less frequently than quarterly containing all the information required
to be disclosed on the immediate confirmation. The customer may not waive this quarterly statement.

Rule 15c1&hyph;4, 17 CFR 240.15c1&hyph;4, an earlier confirmation rule, was adopted by the Commission in 1937. Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 1330 (Aug. 4, 1937). This rule, which solely applied to transactions in securities in the
over-the-counter market, was replaced in 1978 by Rule 10b-10, which extended the Commission's confirmation requirements
to trades conducted on a securities exchange. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15219 (Oct. 6, 1978), 43 FR 47495.
Rule 10b-10 initially was adopted in part in May 1977. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13508 (May 5, 1977), 42 FR
25318 (``Adopting Release'').

The proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 would: (1) Require confirmation disclosure of mark-ups and mark-downs for
riskless principal transactions in debt securities; (2) require disclosure of the fact that a debt security is not
rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; (3) require confirmation disclosure of mark-ups
and mark-downs in Nasdaq and exchange-listed securities; (4) require disclosure regarding whether broker-dealers
are not members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation; (5) modify the disclosure requirements with
respect to certain collateralized debt securities; (6) add a preliminary note to the Rule indicating that the Rule's
disclosure requirements do not limit disclosures necessary under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws; and (7) restructure the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 15c2&hyph;13 would require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers (1) to disclose mark-up
information in riskless principal transactions in municipal securities; and (2) to disclose when a particular municipal
security is not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The confirmation serves several functions: it acts as a customer invoice; informs investors of the details of a transaction,
allowing the investor to check for errors or misunderstandings; provides consumer information, allowing investors
to evaluate the cost and quality of the services provided by broker-dealers; discloses to investors possible conflicts
of interest between them and the broker-dealer; and acts as a safeguard against fraud, by permitting the customer
to detect problems associated with a transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of a settlement period of three days (``T+3'') may alter the confirmation's utility as a customer
invoice because normal confirmation delivery and the transfer of customer funds and securities may not be possible
within the three day settlement period. Under the previous settlement period of five days, confirmations generally
reached customers in time for the customer to review them prior to transferring funds or securities to the transacting
broker-dealer. Under T+3, the customer frequently will not receive the confirmation through the mails by day three;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 thus, shortening the settlement period may require broker-dealers either to demand funds or securities from the
customer earlier than at present or to cover the cost of the transaction for a longer period of time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

is used less frequently as an invoice, should some of the confirmation's content be shifted to periodic account statements?

Some commentators suggested that substantive changes to Rule 10b-10 will be necessary as a result of the adoption
of Rule 15c6&hyph;1 of the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.15c6&hyph;1, which implemented T+3. Because Rule 10b-10 requires
a broker-dealer to send a customer written confirmation ``at or before completion of the transaction,'' some have
argued that a T+3 settlement period will make compliance with Rule 10b-10 impossible. The Commission notes, however,
that broker-dealers can comply with Rule 10b-10 even under a T+3 settlement period. Rule 10b-10 requires only that
the broker-dealer send written confirmation by settlement date, not that the customer actually receive it by settlement.
In the current five days settlement period, broker-dealers typically send customer confirmations the day after
trade date, which will satisfy Rule 10b-10 even under a T+3 settlement period.

Rule 10b-10 currently requires disclosures of broker-dealer compensation in agency and specified principal trades.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 10b-10 to require the disclosure of mark-up information for riskless principal
trades in debt securities, other than U.S. Savings Bonds and municipal securities. The Commission also is proposing
Rule 15c2&hyph;13 to require disclosure of mark-up information in riskless principal trades in municipal securities.
Rule 10b-10 currently requires confirmations for transactions in debt securities to disclose to the customer the
net dollar price and yield, but not separate disclosure of compensation information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that investors in debt securities, like investors in equity securities, should be informed
of the costs in riskless principal trades because, despite the legal distinctions, these trades are the functional
equivalent of transactions effected on an agency basis.

Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1(a)(4), 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1(a)(4), defines ``Reported Security'' as any exchange-listed
equity security or Nasdaq security for which transaction reports are made available on a real-time basis pursuant
to an effective transaction reporting plan. An ``effective transaction reporting plan'' refers to a transaction
reporting plan that the Commission has approved pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1. 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1(a)(3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reported Securities presently include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Nasdaq securities that meet standards set forth in the National Market System Securities Designation Plan (``Nasdaq/NMS
securities''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Certain securities listed on a national securities exchange that meet standards of the transaction reporting
plan known as the Restated Consolidated Tape Association Plan (``CTA Plan''). This would include securities that
are registered or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange, including securities
listed on various regional exchanges, and that substantially meet New York Stock Exchange, Inc (``NYSE'') or American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') original listing criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of securities that are quoted on Nasdaq and listed on certain regional stock exchanges, however, are not subject
to an effective transaction reporting plan. Approximately 1,600 securities traded on Nasdaq do not satisfy the criteria
for designation as a Nasdaq/NMS security, and thus are not part of an effective transaction reporting plan. Similarly,
a limited number of regional-exchange listed securities are not covered by the CTA Plan.

''Riskless'' principal trades are transactions in which, after receiving an order to buy or sell from a customer,
the broker-dealer purchases the security from another person to offset a contemporaneous purchase by the customer
or sells the security to another person to offset a contemporaneous sale by the customer. Although these transactions
are characterized as riskless, they still involve counterparty risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On three previous occasions, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 that would have required disclosure
of mark-ups for riskless principal trades involving debt securities, including municipal securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commentators argued against adoption of mark-up disclosure for riskless principal debt trades saying that: (1)
The amount of a mark-up was not material to investors; (2) adoption of the proposal would have a detrimental, disproportionate
effect on small broker-dealers; and (3) the amendment would present compliance and enforcement difficulties because
of differences between the debt and equity markets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 together with experience with mark-up disclosure in riskless principal trades for equities, the Commission believes
that mark-up disclosure for riskless principal trades in debt securities should be revisited.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Confirmation disclosure of mark-ups in riskless principal transactions will aid investors by disclosing to them
transaction costs. This will assist the client in monitoring brokerage expenses and detecting possible improper
practices. For instance, the Commission understands that mark-ups charged in riskless principal trades in long-term
securities are substantially greater than mark-ups charged in short-term securities, because the impact on disclosed
yield is smaller in the long term trade. The Commission believes that customers should be given the ability to compare
mark-ups in these trades.

define equity security to include any security convertible into an equity security. Debt security is defined to include
a convertible security for purposes of certain paragraphs of Rule 10b&hyph;10, but not for purposes of mark-up disclosure

In withdrawing the riskless principal mark-up disclosure proposal in the 1978 Release, the Commission stated that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requiring disclosure of mark-ups in riskless principal trades in debt securities would supplement the Commission's
and self-regulatory organizations' enforcement programs, by giving investors greater ability to review the mark-ups
on their transactions. As a practical matter, the proposed amendment also may permit broker-dealers that consistently
observe the highest standards of practice to compete more effectively against broker-dealers that charge excessive
mark-ups.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unlike current disclosure requirements for riskless principal transactions in equity securities, the proposed
amendment and Rule 15c2&hyph;13 do not include an exclusion for market makers. This exclusion is omitted because
market makers have a much more limited function in the debt markets. Typically, dealers in these markets, especially
the municipal market, do not display two-sided quotations nor carry inventories of debt securities, as is characteristic
of a market maker in equity securities. Because of the tax implications, the lack of dealer inventory, and the relative
illiquidity of the market for any particular municipal security, short positioning of municipal securities is difficult
and imposes greater risk that a dealer will be unable to cover its short position.

Short positioning municipal securities is rare because the Internal Revenue Service will not allow both a borrower
and lender of a municipal security to claim a tax exemption. In effect, the lender of a municipal security would be trading
tax exempt interest for taxable interest. In addition, to the extent that any short positioning occurs with respect
to municipal securities, the IRS imposes additional reporting requirements on the participating parties.

The Commission requests comment on the proposal to disclose mark-ups in riskless principal transactions in debt
securities. In particular, the Commission requests comment concerning whether proposals requiring mark-up disclosure
in riskless principal transactions in municipal securities should be incorporated in one rule under the authority
of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''), rather than the Commission. In addition, comment is sought
concerning the proposed definition of riskless principal contained in sub-paragraphs (e)(10) and (b)(3) of Rule
10b-10 and Rule 15c2&hyph;13, respectively.

principal debt transactions for business purposes, such as determining the compensation of sales personnel.

securities should cover securities transactions occurring on the same day rather than limiting the disclosure solely
to riskless principal transactions.

2. Disclosure of Unrated Debt Securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, both Rule 10b&hyph;10 and Rule 15c2&hyph;13 will require broker-dealers to disclose when a debt security,
other than securities defined under Section 3(a)(42)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Commission is not requiring the disclosure
of the specific rating of a debt security because that information most likely will be disclosed to a customer when
a broker-dealer sells such a security. Brokers are less likely to inform customers that a security is not rated. While
the Commission recognizes that an unrated bond may not necessarily be unsound or speculative, this information will
benefit investors by alerting them that they may want to make further inquiry of the broker-dealer. In the municipal
securities market, this information is particularly useful because of the limited secondary market information
in that market and the comparatively higher rates of issuer default for unrated municipal bonds.

 Doing so would treat similar securities consistently and would provide benefits to customers with little additional
burden on broker-dealers. Because securities traded through Nasdaq and regional exchanges are subject to last sale
reporting requirements, and NASD members are required to disclose on confirmations the reported price, the customer's
price, and the difference, capturing and disclosing the same information for purposes of complying with Rule 10b&hyph;10
would not appear to require systems changes or additional personnel.

A number of incidents involving the financial failure of registered broker-dealers, and their unregistered affiliates,
have illustrated the potential for confusion about the application of SIPC coverage to customers' accounts. In one
of these cases, a registered broker-dealer and its government securities affiliate were commonly owned, shared
personnel and office facilities, and did not distinguish between the two entities in certain written and oral communications,
leading to customer confusion concerning SIPC coverage.

In order to reduce the potential for confusion regarding whether SIPC coverage exists for accounts with government
securities dealers, as well as other cases where an investor might mistakenly assume that SIPC coverage exists, the
Commission is proposing to amend Rule 10b&hyph;10 to require broker-dealers that are not SIPC members to affirmatively
state in the customer confirmation that they are not SIPC members and to require disclosure if the account is carried
by a broker or a dealer that is not a SIPC member. This disclosure requirement would be consistent with the authority
granted to the Commission concerning SIPC disclosure under the Government Securities Acts Amendments of 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to amend the yield disclosure requirements with respect to asset-backed securities.
The Rule currently requires broker-dealers that effect transactions in debt securities, other than U.S. Savings
Bonds or municipal securities, to disclose: (1) The yield to maturity, if the transaction is effected on the basis
of dollar price; (2) if the transaction is effected on a yield basis, then the dollar price calculated from that yield;
and (3) if effected on a basis other than dollar price or yield to maturity, and the yield to maturity will be less than
the represented yield, then both the yield to maturity and represented yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When these amendments were adopted, the Commission noted the importance of yield data to an investor in transactions
in debt securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The yield, or dollar price, at which a transaction is effected in the secondary market will be directly related to the
anticipated maturity. Thus, features that cause a debt security to pay sooner or later than expected will alter the
actual yield that an investor receives.

In recognition of this effect, the Commission excluded from the actual yield disclosure requirements securities
that represent an interest in notes secured by liens upon real estate continuously subject to prepayment.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission noted that fluctuations in interest rates may cause mortgage notes underlying participation certificates
to prepay at rates faster or slower than anticipated. At the time the Commission adopted the yield amendments, the
primary application of the exception was to transactions in securities issued or guaranteed by the Government National
Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.

For purposes of paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4), the term ``debt security'' is defined in Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(4), 17
CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(e)(4), to include a fractional or participation interest in notes. The Commission also excepted
securities with a maturity date that may be extended by the issuer.

Since 1983, when the yield disclosure provisions were added to the rule, the ``structured financing''
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 market has been dramatically increased to include securities backed by mortgage notes, automobile loans, computer
leases, consumer debt, and other receivables. Also, broker-dealers now offer a variety of derivative mortgage instruments
and structured financing vehicles in which payment to investors is related directly to payments of principal and
interest on underlying debt instruments. In many cases, these various asset-based securities subject the investor
to the same prepayment risks that are present in mortgage participation certificates. To reduce prepayment exposure
from asset backed securities for some investors, collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs'') have been developed.

``Structured financing'' is a financing technique whereby a sponsor, which has originated or has purchased certain
financial collateral, such as accounts receivable or mortgage loans, transfers such assets to a trust, a limited
purpose entity organized solely for purposes of the offering. That entity then issues debt obligations or equity
securities with debt-like characteristics. The process also has been termed ``securitization.''

CMOs are collateralized by pools of residential mortgage loans. Like other asset-backed securities, the rate of
prepayment on the underlying collateral of CMOs is correlated inversely with interest rate changes in the general
economy. The actual maturities of CMOs are dependent on these prepayment speeds. CMOs are priced on the basis of the
estimated ``weighted average life'' (``WAL'') of individual CMO tranches. As interest rates decline, prepayments
increase, with a corresponding shortening of WALs. Conversely, an increase in interest rates results in a lengthening
of maturity. Estimated yields cannot be established without some prepayment assumption underlying the WAL; for
this reason, disclosure of accurate prepayment assumptions, and an appreciation of their implications, is essential
to making a sound investment decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMOs are offered in several tranches of varying maturity and yield that are intended to appeal to a broad spectrum of
investors. One or more tranches typically are structured as a planned amortization class (``PAC''). PAC bonds, whose
maturities are shielded from both WAL extension and contraction risk, have the maximum protection available in CMOs.
Unlike PAC bonds, target amortization class (``TAC'') bonds only provide protection against rapid prepayments,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, against a shortening of maturity. In CMO offerings there also are ``support classes,'' or ``companion classes,''
of the PAC or TAC bond classes, which bear a disproportionate share of prepayment risk.

The PAC bond's cash flow stability is achieved by giving its principal payments a higher priority than those of the
CMO ``companion'' tranches. While PAC bonds generally yield about 50 to 75 basis points above comparable Treasury
bonds, companion tranches can yield as much as 150 to 175 basis points above comparable Treasury bonds, an attractive
yield for investors seeking alternatives to money market funds and certificates of deposit. As a by-product of PAC
or TAC bonds, however, ``companion'' bonds are more volatile than PAC or TAC bonds. According to Fitch Investors Service,
Inc., ``companion'' bonds generally demonstrate ``moderate-to-high volatility, with a very small percentage
having low volatility.'' ``CMO Tranche Risk Revealed,'' Fitch Investors Service, Inc. 3 (April 6, 1992).

In view of the changes in the structured financing market described above, the Commission proposes to revise the yield
disclosure requirements for asset backed securities. On the one hand, the Commission proposes to expand the range
of debt securities where yield need not be disclosed to include any asset backed security subject to continuous prepayment.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 Broker-dealers must disclose yield information with respect to debt instruments that are insulated from prepayment
risk, or where sufficient certainty exists to permit an accurate forecast of the yield that investors will receive.

For example, the Commission notes that mortgage loans on multi-family housing may contain substantial prepayment
penalties, so that a security collateralized by or representing an interest in such notes would be expected to provide
a predictable payment stream to investors. Similarly, automobile receivables may provide a predictable payment
stream because automobile owners are less likely to prepay their automobile loans. By their nature, certain securities,
such as most mortgage-backed bonds, also provide certainty of cash flow.

On the other hand, the Commission proposes to treat CMOs differently from other debt instruments under the proposed
amendments. A broker-dealer effecting transactions in CMOs would be required to disclose, with respect to the security,
(1) estimated yield, (2) the weighted average life, and (3) the prepayment assumptions underlying the yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission emphasizes that the proposed amendments only would apply to yield disclosure on a confirmation and
would not affect the broker-dealer's obligation under the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws to disclose material information, apart from that required by Rule 10b&hyph;10, regarding the composition
of mortgage pools or other factors that will affect yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this connection, the Commission requests comments concerning the manner in which yields are represented to investors
in mortgage-backed securities; the assumptions made by broker-dealers concerning prepayment speed for mortgage
pools; and how interest rate risk and foreclosure risk are disclosed to investors in mortgage-backed securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on the effect of the amendments on customer understanding of the return on their investments.
In addition, the Commission requests comment on the advisability of requiring separate disclosure relating to the
prepayment assumptions underlying a yield quotation in a CMO and on the written confirmation for a transaction in
a CMO.

6. Preliminary Note to Rule 10b&hyph;10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposes to add a preliminary note to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to clarify the relationship between the Rule's
disclosure requirements and additional disclosures that may be required to satisfy antifraud provisions of the
federal securities laws. In several cases over the years, broker-dealer defendants have argued that because Rule
10b&hyph;10 did not require disclosure of specific information on a confirmation, it was not material for purposes
of the general antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although courts have given short shrift to these arguments, the Commission wishes to reiterate that Rule 10b&hyph;10
is not a safe harbor from the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not attempt to set forth all possible categories of material information to be disclosed by broker-dealers
in connection with a particular transaction in securities. Rule 10b&hyph;10 only mandates the disclosure of information
which can generally be expected to be material. Of course, in particular circumstances, additional information
may be material and disclosure may be required.

Two theories, the fiduciary and shingle theory, establish an obligation on the part of a broker-dealer to deal with
customers fairly. In cases where a broker-dealer has established a customer relationship based upon trust and confidence,
and the customer depends upon and follows the broker-dealer's advice, a fiduciary relationship is established between
the broker-dealer and customer. As a fiduciary, the broker-dealer also is obligated to disclose all the material
facts of a customer's transaction.

The fact that a broker-dealer has met the requirements of Rule 10b&hyph;10 should begin the analysis, not end it. The
confirmation is delivered after the contract is created. Thus, irrespective of the content of the confirmation,
specific terms of the transaction that may affect the customer's investment decision should be disclosed at the time
of a purchase or sale of a security.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include
promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic
birds are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject
to inhumane treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs
in countries of origin. This proposed rule would implement procedures for approval of foreign captive-breeding
facilities and establishment of an approved list of species listed in the Appendices to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora that can be imported.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule proposes regulations implementing aspects of the WBCA, which was signed into law on October 23, 1992. This
is the second of two notices of proposed rulemaking under the WBCA; the first was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 12, 1993 (58 FR 42926). The first final rulemaking under the WBCA was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60524). The WBCA limits or prohibits imports of exotic bird species to ensure that their
wild populations are not harmed by trade. It also encourages wild bird conservation programs in countries of origin
by both ensuring that all trade in such species involving the United States is biologically sustainable and is not
detrimental to the species, and by creating an Exotic Bird Conservation Fund to provide conservation assistance
in countries of origin. The final rule of November 16, 1993, summarized the effects of the WBCA and proposed procedures
for obtaining import permits authorized by exemptions in the WBCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An immediate moratorium, effective October 23, 1992, was established on the importation of ten species of wild birds
of particular concern that are listed in appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, or Convention), two of which were moved to appendix I at the March 1992 CITES meeting.
The prohibition on importation of those species was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the one-year delay period from October 23, 1992, to October 22, 1993, there was an import quota on CITES-listed
bird species. That quota was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). A notice published on March 30, 1993 (58 FR 16644), solicited public comments and
announced a public meeting, held April 15&hyph;16, 1993, to receive input from the public in the development of regulations
to implement some of the provisions of the WBCA. Useful input was received from a broad cross-section of interested
members of the public who participated in the meeting and submitted comments in writing; that input has been utilized
in developing this proposed rule. A notice published on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19840) announced species for which the
quota had been met and no further individual birds could be imported.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the publication of the final rule of November 16, 1993, imports of all CITES-listed birds (as defined in the final
rule) are prohibited, except for species included in an approved list, or for which an import permit has been issued.
The approved list, which will include species (by country) and/or specific captive-breeding facilities, is proposed
herein. The Service also has the emergency authority to suspend imports of any CITES-listed bird species at any time
based on a series of criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking proposes regulations called for in the WBCA that will accomplish the following:
(1) For wild-caught CITES-listed birds to be on an approved list, the Service must determine that: CITES is being effectively
implemented for the species for each country of origin from which imports will be allowed; CITES-recommended measures
are implemented; there is a scientifically based management plan for the species that provides for the conservation
of the species and its habitat, includes incentives for conservation, ensures that the use of the species is biologically
sustainable and maintained throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in its ecosystem, and addresses
factors that include illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, disease, and habitat loss; and that the methods
of capture, transport, and maintenance of the species minimize the risk of injury or damage to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For captive-bred birds to be imported from other countries, in order to be listed in an approved list, the Service
is required to determine either that the species is regularly bred in captivity and no wild-caught birds of the species
are in trade, or that the species is bred in a qualifying facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is also required to review trade in all non-CITES avian species, and establish a moratorium on the import
of any species, by country of origin, if any of a series of findings cannot be made. The procedures for such findings
will be proposed in a future notice of proposed rulemaking.

Section 15.31&blank;Criteria for Including Species in the Approved List for Captive-Bred Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 106 of the WBCA, the Secretary is required to publish a list of species of exotic birds that are listed
in an appendix to the Convention and that are not subject to a prohibition or suspension of importation otherwise applicable
under the WBCA. In order to list a species as exclusively captive-bred, the Service is required to determine that the
species is regularly bred in captivity and no wild-caught birds of the species are in trade, legally or illegally.
These captive-bred species can be imported into the United States without meeting any additional requirements of
the Wild Bird Conservation Act or this part 15; however, all of the existing requirements in parts 13 and 14, part 17
(species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)), part 21 (Migratory Bird Treaty
Act) and part 23 (species listed in the Appendices to the Convention, or CITES) must still be complied with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section establishes the criteria for the approval of the importation of captive-bred species. In the House of
Representatives Committee Report for the WBCA, the Secretary was instructed ``to use the standards adopted by the
State of New York with respect to importation of captive-bred species, and include such species on the approved list
under this section, as long as the Secretary believes that trade based on these standards will not result in harm to
species in the wild.'' These standards direct the Secretary to include species of exotic birds in the approved list
if the species is regularly bred in captivity and none are taken from the wild for the trade. In order to comply with such
standards, the Service proposes the following criteria for the approval of the importation of foreign captive-bred
species: (a) All specimens of the species known to be in trade (legal or illegal) must be captive-bred; (b) No specimens
of the species can be known to be removed from the wild for the pet bird market; (c) Any importation of specimens of the
species must not be detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild; and (d) Adequate enforcement controls must
be in place in countries of export to ensure compliance with the aforementioned paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a species is bred in captivity in large numbers, but individual birds of that species are frequently, sometimes,
or even rarely taken from the wild, or if there are enforcement concerns that illegal trade occurs in the species, that
species cannot be included as a captive-bred species. Thus, that species would not be approved as a captive-bred species.
However, individual captive-bred birds may still be imported into the United States under one of the following conditions:
(1) The foreign breeding facility could be approved pursuant to subpart E of this part 15; or (2) a permit for an individual
import could be obtained pursuant to subpart C, if the requirements of that subpart are met.

15.32&blank;Criteria for Including Species in the Approved List for Non-Captive-Bred Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 106 of the WBCA, the Secretary is required to publish a list of species of exotic birds that are listed
in an Appendix to the Convention and that are not subject to a prohibition or suspension of importation otherwise applicable
under the WBCA. For non-captive-bred (i.e., wild-caught) exotic birds to be imported from other countries, in order
to be listed in an approved list, the Service is required by the WBCA to ``use the best scientific information available,
and to consider the adequacy of regulatory and enforcement mechanisms in all countries of origin for the species,
including such mechanisms for control of illegal trade.'' In developing criteria on which to base approval of sustainable
use management plans, the Service reviewed information available on the sustainable use of exotic birds subject
to international trade. Beissinger and Bucher (1992) proposed a model for sustainable use of parrot species when
biological data are incomplete (Bioscience Vol. 42, No 3, March, 1992: Can Parrots be Conserved through Sustainable
Harvesting?); the Service drew upon this model in developing the approval criteria for non-captive-bred species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WBCA requires the Service to ``find that the Convention is being effectively implemented with respect to that
species''. The Service believes that it is conceivable, although extremely unlikely, that a country which is not
a CITES Party might be complying with all relevant CITES requirements. However, a country that is not a CITES Party
can be considered for approval of its sustainable use management plan under this rule. The Service does not wish to
discourage the development of effective sustainable use management plans. The Service welcomes comment and input
on these qualification requirements, in order to ensure that the final rule promotes conservation objectives and
expands opportunities to implement scientifically-based management strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WBCA requires the Service to make the finding that the Convention is being effectively implemented, by making
each of the following findings specified in section 106, paragraph (c) of the WBCA, each of which the Service has included
in &sect;15.32(b): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the country of origin has established a Scientific Authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the requirements of Article IV of the Convention are implemented with respect to that species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, since the WBCA requires that each country be effectively implementing the Convention, the proposed
approval criteria also require that countries demonstrate implementation of Article VIII of the Convention regarding
establishment of implementing legislation and submission to the Convention's Secretariat of required annual reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That remedial measures recommended by the Parties to the Convention with respect to that species are implemented.
The House of Representatives Committee Report for the WBCA states that ``The Committee expects that the Secretary
will weigh heavily the willingness and commitment of an exporting country to implement remedial measures in deciding
whether to include a species on the list of approved species.'' This factor is included in the criteria for approval
of country management plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ``That a scientifically-based management plan has been developed for the species which provides for the conservation
of the species and its habitat and includes incentives for conservation'' (Section 106, paragraph (c)(2)(A) of the
WBCA). The proposed approval criteria incorporate this consideration in a number of ways, including requiring:
(a) Information on species conservation status and distribution; (b) habitat conservation information, including
habitat requirements, habitat distribution and protection status, and habitat status and trends; and (c) information
on population dynamics, including population assessments, reproductive success, and evidence of how the sustainable
use management plan promotes the value of the species and its habitats. In the case of habitat information, several
pieces of information are required, including management plans for habitats important to the species. They are only
required, however, if they are available or applicable. For a species that breeds in the country of export, the Service
has proposed a requirement of a description of nest sites and/or plant communities that are most frequently used for
placement of nests and, if applicable, nesting habits. Nesting habit information may include clutch size, ability
to renest, nesting season, and known nest competitors/predators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) ``That a scientifically-based management plan has been developed for the species which ensures that the use of
the species is biologically sustainable and maintained throughout the range of the species in the country to which
the plan applies at a level that is consistent with the role of the species in the ecosystem and is well above the level
at which the species might become threatened with extinction'' (Section 106, paragraph (c)(2)(B) of the WBCA). The
proposed criteria, in fulfilling this statutory requirement, require the following: (a) Information on the population
of the species; and (b) information on the species' role in its ecosystem, including nest requirements and diet. The
proposed rule requires information on any species or plant community that is dependent on the occurrence of the exotic
bird species, in order to make the required finding that the proposed capture and export are at levels that are consistent
with the role of the species in its ecosystem. The proposed rule requires recent population data of the population
of the species in the country of export, as derived from indices of relative abundance (such as catch per unit effort
or call count surveys) or population estimates (if available), along with documentation for each estimate. These
population data or estimates should be based on studies conducted for at least three separate years, or data for one
year can be provided, with a description of survey plans for future years. Population assessments should have been
conducted during the same season (breeding or non-breeding) of each year for which documentation is submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For long-lived, more ``K-selected'' species of birds (as listed in the proposed rule in &sect;15.32) the Service
is proposing to require that the management plan (for species that breed in the country of export) include information
on nesting ecology, and reproductive rates or mortality rates. Those species are defined as those not in one of 19 specified
families of birds. The Service is proposing more rigorous standards for the sustainable utilization of ``K-selected''
species, based on an awareness that their sustainable utilization is very difficult, and that they are extremely
sensitive to population depletion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For species included in one of the 19 families of birds specified in the proposed rule in &sect;15.32 (more ``r-selected''
species), the Service is proposing that, instead of detailed demographic information, the management plan (for
species that breed in the country of export) need only include an estimation of recent reproductive success. Reproductive
success may be estimated using pre-breeding and post-breeding counts, wherever that is appropriate. For all birds,
when the species occurs in the country of export only during the nonbreeding season, the Service proposes to require
documentation or a letter from the Convention Scientific Authority that the species does not breed there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has proposed, for the purposes of the WBCA, to define sustainable use as ``the use of a species in a manner
and at a level such that populations of the species are maintained at optimal levels for the long term and involves a
determination of the productive capacity of the species and its ecosystem, in order to ensure that utilization does
not exceed those capacities or the ability of the population to reproduce and maintain itself.'' In order to determine
that the management plan utilization of the species is sustainable, the Service proposes to require evidence of how
levels of sustainable use were determined, including either (1) adequate long-term trends in relative abundance
and take levels, or (2) population estimates, reproductive success, and estimation of the number exported from the
country during the past 2 years, and the number of birds removed directly from the wild for export, domestic trade,
illegal trade, subsistence use, and other purposes. The information should include the estimated number of birds
to be removed from the wild from each area or region of take each year for all purposes, including age-class information
for ``K-selected'' species, and a description of future plans to monitor the species in each area of take and to determine
whether the number of birds taken has been sustainable. Throughout the proposed rule, area or region of take refers
to the area or region within the country of export where birds will be removed from the wild; the degree of specificity
used will depend on the particular situation in the country of export. If the species is abundant throughout its range,
the region of take could be the entire country; a species that is locally abundant but rare elsewhere might have a more
restricted area of take. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is aware that the criteria for approval of sustainable use management plans proposed herein may appear
to be rigorous, and although desirable and scientifically valid, they may be difficult for many countries. The Service
proposes to give particularly positive consideration to situations wherein very conservative capture and export
quotas are implemented prior to being able to obtain all of the biological information necessary for a more large-scale
management plan (in effect, a ``preliminary'' approval). Thus, the more tentative the biological information is,
the more conservative the capture and export quotas are expected to be; the closer the capture quotas are to the reproductive
capacity of the species, the biological information is expected to be more rigorous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) ``That a scientifically-based management plan has been developed for the species which addresses factors relevant
to the conservation of the species, including illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, disease, and habitat
loss'' (Section 106, paragraph (c)(2)(C) of the WBCA). The proposed criteria, in fulfilling this statutory requirement,
require the following information: estimation of annual mortality or loss, including natural mortality and take
for subsistence use, export trade, and domestic trade (in each area or region of take); and the estimated number of
birds that will be removed from the wild from each area or region of take each year for all purposes (export trade, domestic
trade, illegal trade, and subsistence use), including information on the regulation of these factors within the
country. When applicable, information on age-classes removed from the wild should be included. As in the previous
paragraph, the Service will give particularly positive consideration to situations wherein very conservative
capture and export quotas are implemented prior to being able to obtain all of the biological information necessary
for a more large-scale management plan (a sort of ``preliminary'' approval). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) That the management plan is implemented and enforced (Section 106, paragraph (c)(3) of the WBCA). The proposed
criteria incorporate this finding in a number of ways, including requiring: (a) Certification from the country of
export's Management Authority that the country has the legal means necessary to ensure enforcement of and compliance
with the requirements of the management plan and to ensure that the number of birds removed from the wild or exported
will be consistent with the management plan; (b) an explanation of infrastructure and law enforcement and monitoring
mechanisms that will ensure compliance with methodology in the management plan; and (c) evidence of implementing
legislation. The Service expects in this context not just a copy of a country's implementing legislation, but a summary
of how that legislation and the management plan is or will be put into practice. Information provided could be varied,
but might include how a country's wildlife department is organized, how the wildlife department will monitor implementation
and enforcement of the management plan, and evidence of prior enforcement actions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(8) That the methods of capture, transport, and maintenance of the species minimize the risk of injury or damage to
health, including inhumane treatment (Section 106, paragraph (c)(4) of the WBCA). The proposed criteria incorporate
this required finding in a number of ways, including requiring: (a) a description of the process of removing birds
from the wild, including locations, time of year of removal, capture methods, means of transport, and pre-export
conditioning; and (b) a description of the shipping methods and enclosures proposed to be used to transport the exotic
birds, including but not limited to feeding and care during transport, and shipping densities. Since there is evidence
that for some species and, in some cases, consignment size may increase the risk of mortality in transport, the Service
has also proposed that estimated consignment sizes be included with the management plan. Although the proposed rule
does not establish a maximum consignment size, the Service will take this factor into consideration in making the
required finding. Consignment size in this context refers to the number of birds in a single shipment exported from
the country of export. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WBCA also requires that the Service ``consider the adequacy of regulatory and enforcement mechanisms in all countries
of origin for the species, including such mechanisms for control of illegal trade'' (WBCA &sect;106(a)(3)). Therefore,
in the approval criteria, for species with a multi-national distribution, the Service proposes to make the following
determinations (the information needed may need to come from sources other than the country requesting approval
of its management plan): (a) whether populations of the species in other countries in which it occurs will be detrimentally
affected by exports of the species from the country requesting approval (this information could be obtained from
those governments and/or from other sources, and could include communication from the Scientific Authorities of
other range states); (b) whether factors affecting conservation of the species, including export from other countries,
illegal trade, domestic use, or subsistence use are regulated throughout the range of the species so that recruitment
and/or breeding stocks of the species are not detrimentally affected by the proposed export; (c) whether the proposed
take and export from the requesting country include enough demographic information to ensure they will not detrimentally
affect breeding populations; and (d) whether the proposed take and export will not detrimentally affect any existing
enhancement activities or conservation programs throughout the species' range.

 wild-caught) species can be imported into the United States without meeting any additional requirements of the WBCA
or this part 15; however, all of the existing requirements in parts 13 and 14, part 17, part 21, and part 23 must be complied
with. Upon receipt of a completed sustainable use management plan for a country of export, the Director will publish
a Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment. Approval of species will be granted in accordance with the criteria proposed in &sect;15.32.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to consider only sustainable use management plans for appendix II species and appendix III species
from the country for which they are listed, since trade for primarily commercial purposes is not permitted under the
Convention for appendix I species. If specimens of an appendix I species are required for zoological, scientific,
or breeding purposes, individuals desiring such import may apply for a permit under Subpart C of this Part 15.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Captive-bred species. In order to establish a proposed list of approved captive-bred species, based on the criteria
in proposed Section 15.31, the Service used the best information available, including import records of captive-bred
species, law enforcement and intelligence data on the commercial trade in captive-bred species, and law enforcement
and intelligence information on the illegal trade in exotic bird species. The proposed list of approved species includes
37 captive-bred exotic bird species that can be imported from any other country, with export permits required by CITES,
other federal laws, and the exporting country. In addition, the Service has proposed to include in the approved list
of captive-bred species several exotic bird species that are not listed in an appendix to the Convention but are regularly
bred in captivity and are not taken from the wild. Although these species are not listed in an Appendix and thus are not
presently prohibited under the WBCA, these species are included in the list for the convenience of the public. To ensure
that there is no confusion, even if the species or higher taxon to which it belongs were subsequently listed in the Appendices
to the Convention, the Service would still consider it to be an approved captive-bred species pursuant to this subpart
D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As established in the WBCA, the Service will periodically review the list of species that meet the approval criteria
for the importation of captive-bred species. Any changes to this approved list will be proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment. The Service is interested in receiving the comments, including documentation, of any interested
individuals or organizations with information on the captive-bred status of any of the species in the list proposed
in this subsection, or of any other exotic bird species that meet the criteria in &sect;15.31 for inclusion in this
list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Non-captive-bred species. No species can be proposed for approval under this paragraph until the proposed regulations
in Section 15.32 are finalized, and a completed sustainable use management plan for a country of export for that species
has been received by the Director. Upon granting approval in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section,
approved species and countries of export would be listed in this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 107 of the WBCA, any person may submit a petition to the Director to determine whether a foreign
exotic bird breeding facility shall be designated as a qualifying facility. If a foreign facility is approved as a
qualifying facility, species of exotic birds for which the facility is approved can be imported into the United States
from that facility without import permits issued pursuant to subpart C of this part 15. In all cases, any additional
requirements in 50 CFR parts 13, 14, 17, 21, and 23 must also be met. Applications for approval shall be submitted to
the Service's Office of Management Authority. A separate application must be submitted for each species for which
approval is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications must contain information as required in paragraph (c) of this section, in order to make a series of findings
required by the WBCA. The Service notes that the fundamental purposes of these findings is to ensure that the birds
exported from these facilities are indeed bred in captivity, no illegal trade is involved, and wild populations are
not harmed by either the breeding program or export from these facilities. The information required includes but
is not limited to the following: (1) Certification from the Management Authority of the country in which the facility
is located that the facility is capable of breeding the species in the numbers to be traded, without detriment to the
wild population of the species; (2) A summary of the legislation, and regulations where appropriate, implementing
the Convention in the country in which the facility is located; (3) A detailed statement of the facility's capability
of breeding the species in captivity in the numbers desired, including breeding methods, experience, and production
levels; (4) A detailed statement demonstrating that the facility is operated in a manner not detrimental to the survival
of the species, including details on the establishment of the parental stock; (5) A statement of any anticipated need
for augmentation of breeding stock from other sources; (6) A detailed statement demonstrating that the facility
is operated in a humane and healthful manner; (7) A description of the care and maintenance practices of the facility,
including mortality and disease records and husbandry, veterinary, and hygienic practices; (8) A statement that
all birds to be exported from the facility will be marked with closed leg bands or an electronic marking system; and
(9) Details on the system of recordkeeping and tracking of birds and their progeny hatched at the facility would be
required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would establish the criteria for approval of foreign captive-breeding facilities by the Director,
and approval conditions and duration. The approval conditions would include: (1) Whether the facility is located
in a country that is Party to the Convention and is implementing the requirements of the Convention, including designation
of functioning Scientific and Management Authorities, submission of annual reports, and establishment of implementing
legislation; (2) Whether the facility is capable of producing captive-bred birds in the numbers to be exported; (3)
Whether the parental breeding stock was acquired from legally obtained, exported, and/or imported birds; (4) Whether
the facility is operated in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild; (5) Whether adequate
enforcement controls are in place; (6) Whether the breeding protocol of the facility is adequate; (7) Whether the
facility is operated in a humane and healthful manner; (8) Whether the facility will provide for proper and healthful
care and maintenance of the birds; and (9) Whether all birds are identifiable through closed leg bands or electronic
marking. The Service welcomes comments on these criteria, including those related to the applicability of relevant
international law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approval conditions established in this section require the submission of an annual report to the Service containing
production and mortality records, including hatching records, numbers of birds exported, and their identification
numbers. As established in the WBCA, approvals are to be effective for three years, provided that the facility continues
to meet the requirements and approval conditions. Each application submitted for approval is proposed to be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Effects of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that this proposed rule is categorically excluded under Departmental procedures in complying
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See 516 DM [Departmental Manual] 2, appendix 1 Paragraph 1.10.
The proposed regulations are procedural in nature, and the environmental effects while crafted to carry out the benign
purposes of the WBCA, are judged to be minimal, speculative, and do not lend themselves to meaningful analysis. Future
regulations implementing the WBCA may be subject to NEPA documentation requirements, on a case-by-case basis.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This action is not expected to have significant taking implications
for U.S. citizens, as per Executive Order No. 12630. It has also been certified that these revisions will not have a
significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as described by the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. Since the rule applies to importation of live wild birds into the United States, it does not contain any Federalism
impacts as described in Executive Order 12612.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Vail Ski Area operates on the White River National Forest, Holy Cross Ranger District, and is located about 100 miles
west of Denver, Colorado. The Category III area encompasses the upper (eastern) portion of the Two Elk Creek watershed
and comprises the southern extent of the special use permit boundary. It is approximately 4,000 acres in size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal consists of two parts. The first includes a request to construct 3 ski lifts, one restaurant, 2 picnic
facilities, and provide about 1,000 acres of lift-accessed ski terrain. The ski terrain would be composed of about
equal portions of existing open bowls, gladed trails through trees, and traditional runs cut in more dense, forested
areas. A system of service road/ski-ways would be constructed to circulate skiers and provide construction and maintenance
access. The area is currently closed to public motorized use and would remain so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second part of the proposal, Vail Associates, Inc. has proposed construction of lift in a mostly developed portion
of the ski area called Tea Cup Bowl. Construction of several ski trails and a short section of road would also be associated
with the Tea Cup lift. For both the Category III and Tea Cup projects, implementation is proposed to begin 1995 and would
span several summers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed project is consistent with prior agency decisions and plans. The area is included in the Rocky Mountain
Regional Guide (1983, Revised May 1992) as a Category 1 priority for future ski area development study. The 1984 White
River National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan EIS and Record of Decision allocated this area to management
emphasizing developed alpine skiing. Finally, an Environmental Assessment prepared in 1986 examined a proposed
Master Development Plan for the entire Vail Ski Area. In the Decision Notice approving this Master Development Plan,
the Forest Service authorized additions to the permit boundary and provided site-specific approval for construction
of developments on much of the special use permit area. However, the Decision Notice required further environmental
analysis for the Category III area following submission of a detailed development plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is intended to improve existing ski conditions at Vail Ski Area, address skier preferences for
bowl and gladed skiing opportunities, and better distribute skiers, particularly during the critical Christmas
to New Year's Day period and when unfavorable weather or snow conditions prevail in the existing Back Bowls. As well,
action is needed to respond to a request which would implement previous land allocation decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation will be fully incorporated into preparation of the EIS. The first step is the scoping process
during which the Forest Service will seek information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies,
and other individuals or groups who may be interested or affected by this action. This information will be used in preparation
of the EIS. Scoping includes inviting participation, determining the project's scope, and identifying potential
issues. The public will also be invited to participate in developing the alternatives and identifying and reviewing
the potential environmental effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary issues associated with this proposal include effects relating to elk habitat, habitat for North American
lynx, biological diversity, non-motorized recreation, wetlands, water quality, maintaining quality skiing opportunities,
and the demand for additional skiing opportunities. As well, there are concerns regarding parking and transportation
in the Town of Vail. The process will examine these and other issues. This analysis will focus on key issues and eliminate
from detailed study insignificant issues or those which have been addressed in previous environmental review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives will be developed and examined which respond to the significant issues and which are consistent with
the purpose and need for the action. Tentatively, the alternatives include the applicant's proposal (described
above) and No Action, which assumes that no development will be allowed. Additional preliminary alternatives include:
the proposal outlined in Vail's 1985 Master Development Plan, which included additional trail development and a
modified version of Vail's current proposal which would include less trail development. These alternatives will
be modified as a result of public scoping. In the EIS, the direct and indirect effects of each of the alternatives, together
with effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions will be evaluated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The lead Agency in the preparation of the EIS is the Forest Service. The process will also include consideration of
designating cooperating agencies. Among those who may become cooperating agencies are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Implementation of this proposal may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service anticipates the Draft EIS will be filed in the Fall of 1994, and the Final EIS in the Spring of 1995.
The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 60 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the
notice of availability in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Livestock and poultry involved in biotechnology experiments to introduce genetic improvements by transgenesis,
i.e., transgenic research animals, may be offered for slaughter for food purposes in official establishments. Agency
review and approval in accordance with 9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75 are required before these transgenic research animals
may be slaughtered for human food use at official establishments. In addition, persons who intend to slaughter transgenic
research animals or their progeny for human food use at official establishments may obtain a copy of the Points to Consider
document, and follow the voluntary guidelines set forth in that document. Persons who follow both the applicable
regulations cited above and the Points to Consider document should note that the inspector in charge (IIC) may still
deny or withdraw the approval to slaughter transgenic research animals for human food use when the IIC deems it necessary
to assure that products prepared at the official establishment are not adulterated, in accordance with the FMIA and
the PPIA. The approval to slaughter commercially produced, nonresearch transgenic animals will be handled separately
at a later date.

Currently, trangenesis is usually conducted by injecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into fertilized eggs to achieve
desired genetic and/or physical changes. This procedure results in only a small proportion of animals being born
with genetic changes. Animals born without genetic change may be used for human food under current policies set forth
in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) June 26, 1986, policy statement published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 23336) which states that existing regulations would be applied to food animals involved in biotechnology experiments.
Also, USDA's policy for the inspection for human food use of livestock and poultry which are involved in biotechnology
research but which are not genetically modified products of biotechnology, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 67054) on December 27, 1991, concerns transgenic research livestock and poultry in which genetic change has
not occurred. Due to the small number of transgenic research animals produced in biotechnology experiments, such
transgenic research animals have not been presented for slaughter in the past. However, FSIS anticipates that production
of such transgenic animals will increase. This notice reaffirms USDA's June 26, 1986, and December 27, 1991, notices,
specifically with regard to animals involved in biotechnology experiments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the high level of public and Congressional interest in biotechnology, FSIS is advising in this notice the
actions it will take to ensure that meat, meat food products, and poultry products derived from livestock and poultry
involved in biotechnology experiments are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. This document also provides
guidance to those using biotechnology to produce genetic changes in livestock and poultry and offering the same for
slaughter at official establishments.

This notice announces the availability of the Points to Consider document, which discusses FSIS policy for the food
safety assessment of transgenic animals and their progeny and sets forth voluntary guidelines regarding the presentation
of transgenic research animals and their progeny for slaughter for human food use at official establishments. For
the purpose of this Points to Consider document, which may be updated as needed, without notice, transgenic animals
are animals whose genetic composition has been changed by introducing selective genes (e.g., recombinant DNA),
whether or not the change physically manifests itself. This definition includes animals developed by antisense,
amplification, and deletion technologies. Individuals interested in performing transgenic animal research and
presenting such animals for slaughter may obtain the most recent copy of the Points to Consider document from the address
identified in footnote 1 in this notice prior to starting his or her research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 9 CFR 309.17 and 9 CFR 381.75, an investigator interested in presenting transgenic research animals for slaughter
should submit data or a summary evaluation of the data to FSIS. When assessing the human food safety of meat, meat food
products, and poultry products from transgenic research animals. FSIS may utilize the recommendations adopted
by the Transgenic Animal Working Group of the USDA's Agricultural Biotechnology Research Advisory Committee. These
recommendations are described in the Points to Consider document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt of all the data or the summary evaluation of data, FSIS will review and assess the data or summary evaluation
of the data. The data or summary of the data must demonstrate that the research conducted on the transgenic research
animals will not result in the products of the transgenic research animals or their progeny being adulterated. Further,
the Administrator of FSIS, or the Administrator's designee, must approve the slaughter of transgenic research animals
at official establishments prior to slaughter. Transgenic research animals approved for slaughter at an official
establishment are subject to the same inspection procedures as other animals offered for slaughter at official establishments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal inspection of meat and poultry products prepared for sale or distribution in commerce or in States designated
under section 301(c) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 661(c)) and section 5(c) of the Poultry Products
Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 454(c)) is required by law and administered by the Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS). However, section 301(c)(2) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 661(c)(2)) and section 5(c)(2) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 454(c)(2))
state that the general requirement of routine Federal inspection ``.&blank;.&blank;. shall not apply to operations
of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores .&blank;.&blank;. when conducted at any retail store
.&blank;.&blank;. for sale in normal retail quantities .&blank;.&blank;. to consumers. .&blank;.&blank;.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS regulations (9 CFR 303.1(d) and 381.10(d)) define retail stores that qualify for exemption from routine Federal
inspection under the FMIA or PPIA. Under the regulations, for an establishment to be an exempt retail establishment
depends, in part, upon the percentage and volume of its trade with consumers other than household consumers, such
as hotels, restaurants and similar institutions. Accordingly, the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations state in terms of dollars the maximum amount of meat and poultry products which may be sold to nonhousehold
consumers if the establishment is to remain an exempt retail establishment. During calendar year 1993, the maximum
amount for meat products was $37,800; for poultry products, the amount was $33,100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 303.1(d)(2)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) further provide that the dollar limitation on product sales by retail stores to consumers other than household consumers
will be automatically adjusted during the first quarter of each calendar year whenever the Consumer Price Index,
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Department of Labor, indicates a change during the previous year
in the price of the same volume of product exceeding $500, upward or downward. The regulations also require that notice
of the adjusted dollar limitation be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLS Consumer Price Index for 1993 indicates an average annual price increase in meat products of 3.0 percent and
an average annual price increase in poultry products of 4.2 percent. When rounded off to the nearest $100, the price
increase for meat products amounts to $1,100 and the price increase for poultry products amounts to $1,400. As a percentage
of the existing dollar limitation, change in excess of $500 is indicated for both meat and poultry products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FSIS, in accordance with &sect;&sect;303.1(d)(2)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and 381.10(d)(2)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the regulations, has automatically raised the dollar limitation of permitted sales of meat products from $37,800
to $38,900 and raised the dollar limitation of permitted sales for poultry products from $33,100 to $34,500.

The Bureau of the Census uses the Questionnaire for Building Permit Official in conjunction with the Survey of Housing
Starts, Sales, and Completions (OMB number 0607&hyph;0110). Data collected in the Survey of Housing Starts are used
to produce statistics on residential construction and are needed by economic policymakers to monitor this sector
of the economy. Census field interviewers use the Questionnaire for Building Permit Official to obtain information
on the operating procedures of a sample of the building permit issuing offices in the United States in order to locate,
classify, list, and sample building permits for residential construction. This information is used to carry out
the sampling for the Survey of Housing Starts and to verify and update the geographic coverage of permit offices. In
calendar years 1995&hyph;96, we plan to automate the data collection by replacing the paper questionnaire with laptop
computers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 28, 1992, the Department determined that U.S. imports of Canadian softwood lumber products are subsidized
(57 FR 22570). The Commerce decision was appealed under Chapter 19 of the FTA. The Panel issued an adverse decision
on May 6, 1993, finding that the Department had not demonstrated that countervailable subsidies existed, and remanded
the case to the Department for further deliberations. The Department completed a redetermination and on December
17, 1993, the Panel issued a second adverse decision, finding that the Department still had not supported its determination
that countervailable subsidies existed. It ordered a second remand, requiring the Department to find that there
were no subsidies. The Department complied with this order, and filed its second redetermination, on January 6, 1994.
The Panel affirmed this redetermination on February 23, 1994 and issued a Notice of Final Panel Action on March 7, 1994.
USTR has until April 6, 1994 to file a request for an ECC review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timken 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision, the Department must publish notice of a decision of the Panel which is not ``in harmony'' with the Department's
final determination. The Panel's March 7, 1994 decision constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's
affirmative subsidy determination. Accordingly, the Department is publishing this notice. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timken 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision also held that the Department must suspend liquidation pending a ``conclusive'' court decision in the action.
Therefore, the Department will continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise until the ECC issues
a conclusive decision in this action. The Department will implement the decision of the ECC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 53320) a Proposed Rule to Revise Regulations for Public Display, Scientific Research and Enhancement Permits
which would clarify that public display activities may occur in captive settings only. Thus, if this rule becomes
final as proposed, it will not provide for conduct of the type of activity being requested by the applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NMFS regulations define the term ``take'' as including feeding wild populations of marine mammals due
to increased incidental interactions with commercial fishing vessels, alterations in feeding behaviors and migratory
patterns, and vulnerability to disease transmission. [See Final Rule published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart
B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its applicance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Goodman filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated November 29, 1993, in accordance with &sect;430.27 of 10 CFR part 430.
The Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 23, 1994, Goodman's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition.
58 FR 8608. Goodman also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on
February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Goodman Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Goodman. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Assertions and Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Goodman's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 40-second
blower time delay when testing its GMN series central furnaces. Goodman states that since the 40-second delay is indicative
of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an improvement in efficiency of 0.6 to 1.0 percent,
the petition should be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. Goodman indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of
these exceptions for its GMN series central furnaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the blower controls incorporated on the Goodman furnaces are designed to impose a 40-second blower delay in
every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE
agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 40-second blower time delay when testing the Goodman GMN series
central furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the GMN series central furnaces, today's Decision and Order
exempts Goodman from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 40-second delay.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is, therefore, ordered that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Goodman Manufacturing Company (Case No. F&hyph;067) is hereby granted as
set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Goodman Manufacturing Company,
shall be permitted to test its GMN series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part
430, with modifications set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:

3.0&blank;Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to appendix N as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.10&blank;Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified
in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the
cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature,
using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner
start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the
power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together;
or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature
safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the
latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control
is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t^), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures.
During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Goodman Manufacturing Company shall comply in all
respects with the test procedures specified in appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the GMN series central furnaces manufactured by Goodman Manufacturing Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Effective March 11, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Goodman Manufacturing Company
on February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994 (Case No. F&hyph;066).

to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). DOE proposes to evaluate
nuclear materials currently stored at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and determine what materials can safely remain
in their current form for an interim period (approximately 5 years) until disposition decisions can be made. DOE will
also determine what materials are at risk and therefore require near-term stabilization to assure continued safe
management. DOE will evaluate the nuclear materials using a proposed set of criteria to determine materials which
require near-term stabilization to help maintain the health and safety of workers and the public and to maintain environmental
quality. DOE would then stabilize the materials determined to be of concern.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE also proposes that some nuclear materials at the SRS should be converted, or should be considered for conversion,
to a useable form. Plutonium-242 is used for research and development programs and the SRS inventory of this material
is needed for this programmatic purpose. As a result, DOE proposes to convert the SRS inventory of plutonium-242 solution
to an oxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, DOE is in the process of determining whether a programmatic need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists for americium-243, curium-244, and neptunium-237. If it is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a need for this material exists, the EIS will also evaluate its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion to a useable form. Any conversion of this material would be for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes other than the production of nuclear weapons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nuclear materials to be evaluated will be those which have historically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been either the feed materials for, or the in-process material of, SRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production and reprocessing programs.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The need for the EIS is driven by the evolving requirements associated with the defense programs of the United States
and the resultant requirement to manage the materials in the interim pending disposition decisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Savannah River Site is an 800 square-kilometer (300 square-mile), controlled area in southwestern South Carolina.
The Site is approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia and 20 miles south of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the SRS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been to produce nuclear materials that support the defense, research, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical programs of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, reactor fuel or target assemblies were chemically dissolved into aqueous solutions in the F- or H-Canyon
chemical separations facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various processes were performed to separate the useful isotopes (uranium-235, uranium-238, neptunium-237, plutonium-238,
americium-243, curium-244, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plutonium-239) from the rest of the fuel and target material. The uranium-235 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solutions were shipped off the site for conversion to a solid form and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uranium-238 in solution was converted to an oxide using the FA-Line facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at SRS. The neptunium-237 was recovered, and when required, converted to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid and fashioned into new targets. The plutonium was recovered and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converted to metal or oxide products using the FB- and HB-Line facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most converted materials were shipped to other DOE sites. Any product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials stored onsite were placed in ``vaults'' designed for storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1992, chemical processing operations were suspended in the canyons to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address a potential safety concern. The concern was subsequently addressed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but prior to resumption of processing, the Secretary of Energy directed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defense-related chemical separations activities (i.e., reprocessing) be phased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out at SRS. Since this decision, the Department has determined that further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action related to the disposition of nuclear material is subject to the NEPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Non-safety related facility operations have remained shut down, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exception of plutonium-238 processing associated with the support of NASA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
missions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these shutdowns, the canyons and the reactor fuel and target storage basins
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 have a large inventory of in-process solutions, fuel assemblies, and targets. This inventory includes materials
containing a wide variety of special isotopes (plutonium-239, uranium-235, plutonium-242, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
americium-243, curium-244, neptunium-237, etc.). There are approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100,000 gallons of in-process solutions in storage and approximately 200 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metric tons of spent fuel and targets in storage.

There are several storage basins currently in use. These are the K-, L-, and P-Reactor basins, the Receiving Basin
for Off-site Fuels (RBOF) located in H-Area, and the Canyon receiving basins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the above solutions and targets, there are over 90,000 gallons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) stored in tanks outside the facility. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UNH contains the uranium-235 recovered from the processing of fuel from SRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production reactors, and DOE, domestic, and foreign research reactors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are also approximately 35,000 55-gallon drums of uranium-238 (known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``depleted uranium'') oxide stored on the site. This material is the product of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing the targets from which plutonium-239 is recovered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For some solutions (e.g., enriched uranium and americium/curium) no conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability exists. Conversion, stabilization, or disposition options must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for such solutions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has established a Secretarial task force to evaluate disposition of surplus nuclear materials stored at various
locations within the weapons complex. Until disposition decisions are made (approximately 5 years), some of the
materials at SRS, due to their form or to the condition in which they are currently maintained, could represent an unreasonable
risk to public and worker health and safety or an unreasonable risk to the environment. For example, the aluminum cladding
on some of the targets is deteriorating due to corrosion. As the cladding corrodes, highly radioactive material is
exposed to the water in the storage basin. Some of this material is released into the water, which can result in increased
worker exposures and environmental releases. Another example of material that could present an unreasonable risk
is stored solutions containing plutonium, other transuranic elements, and uranium. These solutions require continuing
vigilance to assure their continued safe storage and to avoid potentially severe radiological impacts should an
accident occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, DOE wants to reduce the cost of maintaining and storing these nuclear materials. The cost to maintain
just the SRS canyons, with their current inventory of material, is about $300 million a year. These costs could be reduced
through consolidation, conversion, and stabilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department proposes to stabilize nuclear materials currently stored at the SRS that are in a condition that may
not be safe over the time that is necessary to make decisions regarding their long-term disposition (approximately
5 years). The EIS will evaluate and identify which nuclear materials should be stabilized because of a health, safety,
or environmental concern related to the condition of the material.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If at any time during the course of preparing the environmental impact statement the Department were to determine
that an emergency condition such as unreasonable risk to public or worker health and safety or the environment exists
with respect to any of the unstable materials, the Department would take action to respond immediately to the situation
and consult with the Council on Environmental Quality regarding alternative arragements for compliance with NEPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also proposes to convert to a useable form those materials for which a programmatic need exists. These
materials are used in research and development programs. Specifically, DOE has identified a need for additional
plutonium-242, and proposes to convert the existing inventory of that material at SRS from a solution to an oxide.
In addition, if during the development of this EIS, a programmatic need is identified for neptunium-237, americium-243,
or curium-244, this material will also be proposed for conversion to a useable form. Any programmatic need for americium-243
and curium-244 could not be satisfied until conversion technology is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Proposed for Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will examine various methods to accomplish stabilization. Based on current information, the preferred alternative
for some of these materials, (e.g., in-process liquids) would be to operate the canyon facilities (including FB-Line
and HB-Line, Phases I and II) only as may be necessary for stabilization, and then to place the facilities in a standby
condition. For some materials, (e.g., americium and curium solutions) the Department currently has no preferred
alternative, and the EIS will assist the Department in identifying a preferred alternative. The Department solicits
public participation in identifying and evaluating alternatives. Alternatives could include dry storage, new
wet storage, and processing for vitrification without chemical separation. Alternatives to the conversion of material
required for programmatic needs have not been identified. Consistent with NEPA's requirement that the ``no action''
alternative be considered, DOE will evaluate the environmental impacts of continuing to manage all materials in
their current form until decisions regarding disposition are made.

Material Inventory Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE proposes to evaluate the inventory of nuclear materials at the SRS and place the material into one of three categories.
These categories are: (1) Materials that may warrant near-term stabilization in order to maintain the health and
safety of workers and the public and to maintain environmental quality; (2) material for which there is still a programmatic
need; and (3) materials for which there is currently no designated programmatic need and which are already in a stable
form. DOE proposes to use the following criteria to categorize material that warrants near-term stabilization and
solicits public comments on how these criteria may be further refined:

1. Materials which, without stabilization, would present a near-term (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 5 years) risk of increasing worker radiation exposure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to hazardous materials by an amount that is not insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Materials which, without stabilization, would present a near-term risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a release of radioactive or hazardous material to the public or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment that is not insignificant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Materials for which stabilization or use of an alternative storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method will, in the near-term, reduce the degree of hazard presented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the material in its current form by an amount that is not insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Material for which stabilization in the near-term would reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation of radioactive waste by an amount that is not insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE intends that decisions regarding which materials merit near-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stabilization will be based exclusively on the risk they pose to the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and health of workers or the public, or to the environment. Although DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects to realize some maintenance related cost savings by stabilizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at-risk materials, DOE does not intend to consider economics as a criterion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the categorization process. That is, DOE does not propose to process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials that DOE determines, after public input, will remain stable until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions regarding disposition can be made, even if it were judged to be cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective to process them in conjunction with materials to be stabilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE solicits public comments on the criteria and approach described above.

2. Waste Management_The impact on the generation, treatment, storage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and disposal of high-level radioactive waste, low-level radioactive waste, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transuranic (TRU) waste, hazardous waste, and mixed waste on new and existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onsite waste management and storage facilities. The EIS will describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types and quantities of waste that would be generated by implementation. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not consider specific waste disposal alternatives (e.g., a comparison of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impacts caused by the treatment and interim storage of vitrified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reprocessing waste with those caused by the treatment and interim storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unprocessed forms). These will be evaluated in the SRS waste management EIS.

DOE will shortly announce its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to prepare an EIS on waste management activities at the SRS. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the EIS is to provide a basis for DOE to select a sitewide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategic approach to managing present and future SRS waste generated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of ongoing operations, environmental restoration activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition, and decontamination and decommissioning activities. The EIS will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address, at a minimum, the generation, minimization, treatment, storage, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of low-level waste, liquid high-level waste, nonradioactive hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste, mixed waste, and transuranic waste.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare a Programmatic EIS on Environmental Restoration and Waste Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EM PEIS) (55 FR 42633, October 22, 1990). An Implementation Plan for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PEIS was published in February 1994. A draft PEIS is currently expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by September 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EIS is currently in preparation and will include, among other issues, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programmatic analysis for the transportation, receipt, processing and storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of spent nuclear fuel, including consideration of sites other than INEL. SRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is one of the alternative sites being evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HB-Line is currently operating to provide plutonium-238 for future space missions. In July 1991, DOE issued an Environmental
Assessment for Radioisotope Heat Source Fuel Processing and Fabrication, DOE/EA&hyph;0534. Based on the analysis
in the EA, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the proposed action, which included operation of HB-Line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phases I and III, does not significantly affect the quality of the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21, 1991; the FONSI was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 25, 1991 (56 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 34057). As part of a negotiated court settlement, DOE is preparing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional EA that will examine impacts of operating HB-Line Phases I and III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond those activities currently underway. The cumulative impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of HB-Line Phases I and III in conjunction with the proposed action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and alternatives will be addressed in this nuclear materials interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management EIS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is preparing an EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the proposed adoption and implementation of a policy for the acceptance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up to 15,000 spent nuclear fuel elements from foreign research reactors. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EIS is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 1995. In the interim, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the needs of certain foreign research reactor operators and to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of a key United States nuclear nonproliferation objective, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to accept a small number of foreign research reactor spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements for storage at an existing SRS wet storage facility. DOE has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared and has issued for public comment, a draft EA (February 1994) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the environmental impact of this proposed interim action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 20, 1992, DOE published an NOI to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare an EIS for the upgrade of canyon exhaust systems at SRS (57 FR 9693). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An Implementation Plan was issued in January 1993. The scope of the upgrade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is being substantially reduced and DOE is presently evaluating what level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis is required under NEPA, as a result of the change in scope.

On July 23, 1993, DOE published a revised Notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intent to prepare a PEIS for reconfiguration of its nuclear weapons complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 39528) due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the reconfiguration alternatives based on scoping comments resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from public review of the revised Notice of Intent and budget projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of this review will be presented in a revised Implementation Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will replace the earlier (February 1992) Implementation Plan. The SRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be analyzed as a candidate site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final marketing plan for the sale of surplus energy from the Snettisham Project is published herein together with
a discussion of the issues raised during the public comment process. Alaska Power Administration (APA) published
the Draft Surplus Power Marketing Plan on January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1013), to start the process to establish allocations
of surplus energy and surplus energy sales contracts for the Snettisham Project. The Marketing Plan is fully compatible
with the Department of Energy's legislative proposal for APA divestiture which is currently undergoing Congressional
consideration.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
APA published the Draft Surplus Power Marketing Plan in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 7, 1994 (FR 59 1013). A public information and comment forum was held January 18, 1994. Written comments
were accepted until February 7, 1994. Two written comments were received. A discussion of the comments is presented
in section III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA has considered the comments received and is publishing herein the Final Surplus Power Marketing Plan. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice also formally invites requests for allocation of surplus energy in accordance with the plan. Based on the provisions
of the Plan, APA will then allocate surplus energy and sign contracts with customers receiving allocations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An Environmental Assessment was prepared for these power marketing activities and a Finding of No Significant Impact
was issued by the Department of Energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Application Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APA formally invites requests for allocations of surplus energy from the Snettisham Project from qualified applicants.
Applicants should advise APA's Administrator in writing of their requests. Written requests must be received at
the APA Headquarters Office at 2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion of Public Comments and Summary of Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APA received two written comments on the Draft Surplus Power Marketing Plan. The points raised in the comments are
discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As originally proposed, a ``major industrial load'' would have been one which was not currently a firm customer of
AEL&amp;P, does not conduct utility type operations, and which has the capability to meet its own energy requirement
in the absence of Snettisham energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both commentators objected to the definition excluding a potential major industrial load, such as a mine, simply
because it is presently a firm customer of AEL&amp;P for a small amount of firm energy used at an office facility. They
proposed that the definition be changed so as not to preclude such loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator suggested that the definition be strengthened as to the requirement for being able to meet its own
energy requirement. They pointed out that a qualified load should be able to meet its own baseload energy requirement
rather than its peak requirements or its requirement during intermittent curtailment of Snettisham energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APA believes these suggestions clarify the intent of the marketing plan. As revised, a major industrial load is one
which does not conduct utility-type operations and whose major load is not currently served as a firm load by AEL&amp;P.
The major industrial load must also have the capability to meet its own baseload energy requirement in the long-term
absence of Snettisham energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator felt that there was apparently a conflict between the provision in section C that ``entities receiving
an allocation of Snettisham resources will be offered an electric service contract&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''
and the provision in section B.3. that ``allocations will be made to AEL&amp;P.'' They asked for clarification as
to whether a major industrial load would enter into a contract with APA, with AEL&amp;P, or with both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential surplus energy customers are encouraged to work directly with AEL&amp;P. In this case, AEL&amp;P will
make the request, the allocation will be to AEL&amp;P, and the contract will be between APA and AEL&amp;P. The major
industrial customer and AEL&amp;P will presumably have their own contractual arrangements. As indicated in the
plan, if service through AEL&amp;P is demonstrated to be infeasible, then APA will consider an allocation and contract
directly with the major industrial customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The contracts for surplus energy should not only include assurance that the allocation will continue after divestiture
with APA, but that the rates charged for energy will continue also. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The contracts will contain language to assure that the allocation continues, but will not contain language which
binds the new owner to a given rate structure. The existing purchase agreement for Snettisham was negotiated to assure
only that allocations would continue, but that the new owner would set their own rates. The contracts will not ``guarantee''
rates for APA, but will allow APA to adjust rates within its own procedures and guidelines. This has been clarified
in the final plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The allocation reservation fee should be refundable to the extent that allocated energy is not made available for
taking during the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This has been clarified in the final plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APA should not allocate energy among competing applicants by dividing it equally, but should be made some other way,
such as proportionate to the size of the requests, or by benefit to the local economy, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are any number of ways to allocate a limited resource. APA expects that if there are competing requests for allocation,
they will all be in excess of the resource available and they will all be based on estimates of future loads rather than
historic use. For this reason APA will divide the resource equally as explained in the plan.

IV. Final Surplus Power Marketing Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Conditions for Allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allocations of surplus energy will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Marketing Plan. These provisions
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. No energy will be allocated for export outside the Juneau market area (that is, the AEL&amp;P service territory)
without firm plans and commitment to finance and build the necessary transmission facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In allocating surplus energy, APA will give preference to public bodies and cooperatives who conduct utility-type
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Surplus energy not allocated to preference customers may be available to serve major industrial loads. For this
marketing plan, a major industrial load is one which does not conduct utility-type operations and whose major load
is not currently served as a firm load by AEL&amp;P. The major industrial load must also have the capability to meet
its own baseload energy requirement in the long-term absence of Snettisham energy. Major industrial loads are encouraged
to work directly with AEL&amp;P so that AEL&amp;P can request an allocation to serve their needs. In this case, allocations
will be made to AEL&amp;P. APA will consider requests for direct service of major industrial loads only if it is demonstrated
that service through the utility is infeasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Contract Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Entities receiving an allocation of Snettisham resources will be offered an electric service contract which will
include the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Contracts will be for a period of 20 years or less beginning at contract execution. Contracts for less than 20 years
may include an option to extend the period up to a total length of 20 years. Contracts will be compatible with the proposed
APA divestiture. Contracts will contain language guaranteeing the continuation of the allocation after divestiture.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Surplus energy will be marketed at the Snettisham firm rate. The rate is presently 3.21 cents/kwh and is subject
to periodic review and adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The contractor will be required to sign a contract within 270 days of APA's letter granting an allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In order to reserve the allocation, the contractor will be required to deposit 10% of the expected cost of the following
year's energy with APA. If the allocated energy is taken during the year, the deposit will be credited toward the cost
of the energy. To the extent that energy is available for delivery, if the allocation is not completely taken the deposit
is non-refundable. In any year, energy reserved in this way but not taken by the contractor may be marketed by APA. In
any case, an applicant must be ready, willing, and able to take initial delivery of power by January 1, 1997 or the allocation
will be withdrawn and the energy reallocated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If the contractor has not committed to a 20-year contract, the contractor will be required to pay a one-time, non-refundable
payment within 30 days after contract execution. This payment will be based on 3% of the average estimated annual energy
delivery during the years between the end of the contract period and the 20-year period times each year less than 20
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Amount Available for Allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Firm energy output (energy available 9 years out of 10) from the Snettisham Project is estimated at 275 gwh/year. Secondary
energy is estimated to vary from 0 to 100 gwh/year and average around 50 gwh/year. This invitation is for requests for
allocation for energy that is surplus to the needs of the Juneau community. An estimate of that need is shown in the table
below. Applicants must be aware that these are only estimates and that the amount of energy required by the community
may vary from these projections. In the event that there are competing requests from qualified applicants, the surplus
energy will be divided equally among the applicants up to their maximum request.

March 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on February 28, 1994, The Producer Group filed a complaint with the Commission concerning the February
4, 1994 tariff filing made by Gaviota Terminal Co. (Gaviota), with a proposed effective date of February 14, 1994.
The Producer Group complains that the failure of Gaviota to file a tariff prior to February 4, 1994 was in violation
of the Interstate Commerce Act for which appropriate sanctions should be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Producer Group states that Gaviota has been operating since June 1991, and had not submitted a tariff to the Commission
until it made its February 4, 1994 filing, notwithstanding that it is an interstate oil transportation company subject
to the terms of the Interstate Commerce Act. The Producer Group states that oil pipelines, such as Gaviota, are obligated
to file their jurisdictional rates for the Commission's examination, and that Gaviota, for almost three years, provided
oil transportation service without a tariff being on file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Producer Group requests the Commission to establish a reasonable rate for the period during which Gaviota operated
without a tariff and to order refunds for any past payments in excess of that rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214
and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests
should be filed on or before April 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 11, 1994.

Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) submitted for filing certain
revised tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, which tariff sheets are enumerated in Appendix
A to the filing. The tariff sheets are proposed to be effective as set forth in Appendix A to the filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that on May 3, 1993 it submitted a Settlement in the referenced proceeding which, among other things, resolved
cost-of-service, cost allocation, rate design and throughput mix for the period September 1, 1992 (the effective
date of Docket No. RP92&hyph;137) through October 31, 1993 (the date immediately preceding the November 1, 1993 effective
date of TGPL's Order No. 636 restructuring). On November 4, 1993 the Commission issued an order approving the Settlement
(November 4 Order).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that the tariff sheets submitted in the instant filing reflect the settlement rates approved by the November
4 Order updated to incorporate tracker filings made subsequent to the date the Settlement was filed (i.e. subsequent
to May 3, 1993). The purpose of those filings was to track, under certain TGPL rate schedules, rate changes made effective
by upstream providers of storage and transportation services. TGPL states that Appendix B to the filing includes
workpapers which support the derivation of TGPL's settlement rates for those services affected by the aforementioned
tracker filings. Also, TGPL has revised its historical imbalance tariff provisions (section 5.8 of Rate Schedules
FT and IT) consistent with the directives set forth in the November 4 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that copies of the instant filing are being mailed to customers, State Commissions and other interested
parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1993 and September 29, 1993, petitions were submitted to the Environmental Appeals Board requesting
review of a PSD permit issued to SEI Birchwood, Inc. (SEI) for construction of a 220-megawatt coal-fired electric
generating facility in King George County, Virginia. These petitions were submitted by Sarah Nasta and Citizens
for Sensible Power (CSP), respectively. The PSD permit was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
(VDEQ) on August 23, 1993, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the EPA, Region III, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Because of the delegation, any PSD permit issued by the VDEQ is an EPA-issued permit for purposes of federal law (40
CFR 124.41; 45 FR 33413 (May 19, 1980)), and is subject to review by the Agency under 40 CFR 124.19 before becoming final.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Appeals Board issued an Order Denying Review of the permit on January 27, 1994, concluding that
review of VDEQ'S permit determination was not warranted and that it met all necessary requirements of federal law.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to the registration or reregistration of a pesticide, the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), must determine
whether the chemical will cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans and the environment under FIFRA. In the process
of making the determination, OPP reviews all data submitted by the registrant to support the effectiveness and safety
of the chemical, published reports or studies from the open literature unpublished reports or studies which bear
on the issues at hand, and the chemical's general and environmental chemistry relationship to possible human and
domestic animal exposure. In some instances, OPP requests the registrant to conduct additional studies, or directly
funds research to complete the registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPP, under IAG DW89936171&hyph;01, is contracting with ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. for specialized technical
assistance in the identification of information shortfalls dealing with the registration of pesticides. This research
effort will concentrate on systematically identifying, analyzing, and evaluating data associated with pesticide
registrations. The intent is to catalog data gaps from the registrant to fully characterize the safe manufacture,
application, re-entry, and residue issues prior to a decision to issue a registration under FIFRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPP has determined that the IAG herein described involves work that is being conducted in connection with FIFRA, in
that pesticide chemicals will be the subject of certain evaluations to be made under this IAG. These evaluations may
be used in subsequent regulatory decisions under FIFRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of this information may be entitled to confidential treatment. The information has been submitted to EPA under
sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of FIFRA and under sections 408 and 409 of FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirement of 40 CFR 2.209(c), 2.307(h), and 2.308(h)(2), this IAG with ORNL and Martin Marietta
Inc. prohibits use of the information for any purpose other than the purposes specified in this IAG; prohibits disclosure
of the information in any form to a third party without prior written approval from the Agency; and requires that each
official and employee sign an agreement to protect the information from unauthorized release and to handle it in accordance
with the FIFRA Information Security Manual. In addition ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. are required to submit for EPA
approval a security plan under which any CBI will be secured and protected against unauthorized release or compromise.
No information will be provided until the above requirements have been fully satisfied. Records of information provided
under this IAG will be maintained by the Project Officer for this contract in OPP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All information supplied to ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. by EPA for use in connection with this IAG will be returned
to EPA when ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. have completed their work.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency has issued Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the pesticidal active ingredients
listed below. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended in 1988, EPA is conducting
an accelerated reregistration program to reevaluate existing pesticides to make sure they meet current scientific
and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed above is substantially
complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these
active ingredients are eligible for reregistration.

To request a copy of any of the listed RED documents, or a RED Fact Sheet, contact the OPP Pesticide Docket, Public Response
and Program Resources Branch, in Rm 1132 at the address given above or call (703) 305&hyph;5805.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All registrants of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate
RED documents and must respond to labeling requirements and product specific data requirements (if applicable)
within 8 months of receipt, with the exception of eugenol and phenyl-ethyl-propionate. Products containing the
other active ingredients will not be reregistered until adequate product specific data have been submitted and all
necessary product label changes are implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For products containing eugenol and phenyl-ethyl-propionate, the Agency is considering these products for exemption
from registration under Section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide and Rodenticide Act. Therefore, no product specific
labeling or data are being required at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both
the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as
final documents with a 60&hyph;day comment period. Although the 60&hyph;day public comment period does not affect
the registrant's response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating
any necessary amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly
affect a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the

III. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before June 15, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1&hyph;year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which
have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless
the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed,
sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved
label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions to these general rules will be made in specific cases when
more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been
imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated
with a particular chemical.

I. Request for Voluntary Cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated October 15, 1993, Union Carbide requested voluntary cancellation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PIROR P-15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36), and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

with the request, and waived any requirement for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication of a notice announcing Agency receipt of this request in advance of Agency acceptance of this request.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Existing Stocks Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Union Carbide's October 15, 1993, request for voluntary cancellation expressly stated that, if EPA accepted the
request, there would be no sale or distribution of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PIROR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 products after November 1, 1993, except for export in accordance with the provisions of FIFRA which address export
of unregistered products. Therefore, after November 1, 1993, Union Carbide, its distributors and supplemental
registrants may not sell, distribute or use these products after November 1, 1993. Other persons (people other than
Union Carbide, its distributors, or its supplemental registrants) holding stocks of the affected products may sell,
distribute, and use their stocks until exhausted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this order, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of the affected products which are in the
U.S. and were not in the custody or control of Union Carbide, its distributors or supplemental registrants after November
1, 1993, the requested effective date of the cancellation.

III. EPA's Decision on the Request for Voluntary Cancellation and Cancellation Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 1, 1993, EPA granted Union Carbide's request that the registration(s) of the following products containing
Paraclox be voluntarily cancelled: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PIROR P-15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36), and PIROR P05 Paper Slimicide and
Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42). Concurrently, EPA is issuing a Cancellation Order for
these products. This notice contains the terms and conditions of the Cancellation Order for these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA, a registrant may request at any time that EPA cancel any of its pesticide registrations.
EPA must publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of receipt of the request allowing public comment before granting the request unless either the registrant
requests a waiver of the notice or the Administrator determines that the continued use of the pesticide would pose
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Union Carbide expressly requested that the cancellation of its
products be effective as of November 1, 1993. Union Carbide also waived any comment period and the requirement for
publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing the Agency's receipt of the request for voluntary cancellation prior to the Agency's acceptance of Union
Carbide's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this Cancellation Order became effective on November 1, 1993. Therefore, as of November 1, 1993, no
person may distribute, sell, or use these product, except as described below. Union Carbide, its distributors and
supplemental registrants may not sell, distribute or use these products except in accordance with provisions concerning
export of unregistered pesticide products. Any other person holding stocks of the affected products may sell, distribute
and use such stocks until exhausted. Any sale, distribution or other disposition of existing stocks that is not consistent
with the terms of this Order will be considered a violation of FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(K) and/or section 12(a)(1)(A),
as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Innovative Technology Council, comprised of EPA management and staff
from across the Agency, has drafted a strategy to focus and target its efforts to accelerate environmental technology
development, commercialization and use. The Council recognizes a need to accelerate the development, commercialization,
and use of innovative environmental technologies to maintain and improve environmental quality at home and abroad
into the 21st century. Environmental quality would deteriorate, given foreseeable population growth and industrialization,
unless technology is developed and more broadly applied, that is more effective in preventing and reducing pollution
levels, less costly than existing technology and supportive of sustainable development. EPA, state and local agencies
are in a unique position to influence the rate and focus of environmental technology innovation and use because of
their legislative and programmatic mandates and regulatory responsibilities (which often influence the demand
for environmental technologies, goods and services).

EPA's draft 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provides a plan to directly and indirectly support private sector innovation and diffusion activities sponsored
by the public and private sector and close coordination among Federal agencies. It focuses on creating incentives
for the development and use of innovative technologies in federal and state environmental regulations, reducing
barriers to technology innovation and use, and improving the competitiveness of the environmental technology industry
in domestic and international markets. EPA and other Federal, state and local agencies, universities, trade associations
and consortia, and numerous private companies are already working in many of the areas identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA is seeking public comment on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to focus and target efforts to accelerate environmental technology development, commercialization and use. The
Agency's Innovative Technology Council plans to revise and update the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``environmental technologies'' being addressed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 varies widely for a number of reasons. The ``environmental technology industry'' has only recently become a focal
point for market analysts and policy-makers, and it is highly diversified in terms of the current demand for and supply
of technologies, goods and services. Demand often varies based on local environmental conditions. ``Environmental
technologies'' include technologies, goods, and services whose development is triggered primarily by environmental
improvement objectives. Sometimes referred to as ``dark green'' technologies, these include: products and services
to monitor and assess pollutant releases and exposure levels; innovative technologies which prevent pollution,
control air and water pollution levels, safely manage waste and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater; and,
manage environmental data. EPA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also addresses ``light green'' technologies that are developed primarily for non-environmental reasons; those
technologies can have indirect, but important consequences for improving environmental quality. An example, would
be local area computer networks designed to enhance office communication, but which also reduce paper use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is interested in promoting all phases of technological change such as: the research and development of new concepts;
preliminary design testing and pilot applications of evolving technologies; performance demonstrations and testing;
evaluations of early commercial applications; and diffusion into domestic and international markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The draft ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Technology Innovation Strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' outlines the general principles that guide EPA in its efforts to foster innovation in its existing programs and
new projects being initiated under the President's Environmental Technology Initiative in FY1994 and FY1995 to
foster the development and use of environmental technologies in solving the nation's environmental problems. It
outlines four objectives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Adapt EPA's policy, regulatory, and compliance framework to promote innovation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Strengthen the capacity of technology developers and users to succeed in environmental technology innovation;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Strategically invest EPA funds in the development and commercialization of promising new technologies; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accelerate diffusion of innovative technologies at home and abroad.

 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.
This notice announces receipt of 12 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.
This notice announces receipt of 23 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Policy Statement establishes non-binding guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the Federal
Communications Commission's (FCC's) broadcast Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) rule. The EEO rule prohibits
discrimination and requires affirmative action by broadcast stations in hiring. The new guidelines provide greater
guidance to stations and the public about what sanction may result from different types of EEO violations.

2. The Commission's broadcast EEO rules and other policies which promote participation by minorities and women in
the broadcast industry are vitally important. They further the Commission's goals of promoting diversity of programming
on broadcast stations. See

the Policy Statement we adopt here will further achievement of that goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In addition to promoting program diversity, our broadcast EEO rules enhance access by minorities and women to increased
employment opportunities. Increased employment opportunities are the foundation for increasing opportunities
for minorities and women in all facets of the communications industry, including participation in ownership.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Those who have access to employment opportunities are able to develop experience and expertise that can be put to beneficial
use in a variety of communications enterprises, in a variety of ways. Thus, by combating discrimination and other
arbitrary barriers to employment, we contribute to the development of the broadcast industry and ultimately promote
the further development of the broader communications infrastructure.

We note, in this regard, that Section 309(j)(4)(C) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, directs the Commission
to promote economic opportunity in competitive bidding among applicants proposing to use the spectrum ``by disseminating
licenses among a wide variety of applicants *&blank;*&blank;* including businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. In 1989, Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to increase substantially the maximum dollar amounts
of forfeitures the Commission could impose on broadcasters under Section 503(b) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission's forfeiture rule has been amended to reflect the higher forfeiture amounts. 47 CFR 1.80(b)(1).

Pub. L. No. 239, 101st Cong., lst Sess. 103 Stat. 2131 (1989) (amending, among other sections, 47 U.S.C. 503(b)). Amended
Section 503(b) provides the Commission with authority to assess forfeitures of up to $25,000 for each violation or
each day of a continuing violation against broadcasters, with a limit on forfeitures for continuing violations involving
a single act or failure to act of $250,000 for broadcasters.

5. On August 1, 1991, in order to assist both the Commission and licensees in adjusting to the statutory increases,
the Commission released its Policy Statement, Standards for Assessing Forfeitures (1991 Policy Statement).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The 1991 Policy Statement provided general, non-binding guidance regarding the assessment of forfeitures. It established
base forfeiture amounts for a wide range of violations. For violations of broadcast EEO rules, the Commission set
a base amount of $12,500. The 1991 Policy Statement also provided that the base forfeiture amount for any violation
could be increased or decreased by applying adjustments to the base amount as relevant to the facts in any particular
case. On August 12, 1993, the Commission released its most recent forfeiture guidelines.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Among other actions, the 1993 Policy Statement deleted the broadcast EEO violation category and indicated that the
Commission would issue a further policy statement on broadcast EEO forfeiture matters at a later date.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Policy Statement we adopt here, as set forth in the Appendix, re-establishes the base forfeiture amount for
violations of the broadcast EEO rules at $12,500. It also provides guidance on what situations may generally lead
to such a forfeiture. In addition, it describes upward and downward adjustment criteria that may be used to adjust
the forfeiture in particular cases. The adjustment guidelines reflect the factors set forth in Section 503(b) of
the Act, &sect;1.80 of our rules and case precedent. See 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(D); 47 CFR 1.80(b)(4). All of these factors
will not necessarily be relevant in each individual case and other adjustments may also be made as appropriate in particular
cases. The Appendix also provides guidance regarding when short-term renewals may be appropriate in particular
cases. We believe that these guidelines will assist the Commission and its staff in determining broadcast EEO forfeitures
in a generally consistent manner that furthers the public interest while nevertheless ensuring that the Commission
and the staff retain the discretion to decide each case based on the specific facts and circumstances at issue. At the
same time, we believe these guidelines will give licensees and the public greater guidance regarding which types
of forfeitures may result from particular types of EEO violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Finally, we stress that we do not intend this Policy Statement to limit our flexibility. In particular cases, forfeitures
that are higher or lower than those reflected by the guidelines may be imposed. In this regard, what we have said in connection
with our prior forfeiture policy statements applies here as well:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he Policy Statement simply describes the general approach the Commission may take in forfeiture cases and is not
binding on any licensees or the Commission. The Policy Statement does not impose any obligations on [licensees] or
require the Commission to issue a forfeiture of any particular magnitude_or any forfeiture at all *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * * *
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e reiterate that while the Policy Statement may guide us and the staff in particular cases, we do not intend for the
Commission or the staff to be bound by it. In addition, both the Commission and the staff intend to apply these guidelines
flexibly. In particular, we and the staff remain committed to deciding every forfeiture case on the basis of the specific
facts and equities presented in the record of that case.

other upward adjustments for ``egregiousness'' factors are present, if the percentage of vacancies for which the
licensee failed to recruit, or the percentage of pools containing minorities, falls below 33% and other factors_e.g.,
use and productivity of recruiting sources, use and productivity of minority-specific sources; evidence of self-assessment_are
absent or particularly inadequate)

Separate Statement of Commissioner James H. Quello
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Matter of Standards for Assessing Forfeitures for Violations of the Broadcast EEO Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission today has voted an item that will prove to be a turning point in the enforcement of our EEO rules. This

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Policy Statement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 sets forth guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the Commission's EEO rules. 47 CFR 73.2080. As
reflected in the statement, the base amount for a forfeiture will be $12,500, an amount that can be increased or decreased
depending on the facts of a given case. These higher forfeitures are a direct result of the increases in forfeiture
amounts imposed by Congress. The guidelines are designed to ensure that these new, higher forfeitures are assessed
in a reasoned, consistent manner. For this reason, and because I strongly support vigorous enforcement of our EEO
rules, I have voted in favor of this item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, at the same time, I am concerned that the Commission may be entering the era of the telecommunications superhighway
wielding a club, rather than offering a hand, to broadcasters making their way down the road. At the dawn of this new
era, we are imposing fines against 22 of 24 radio stations whose EEO records were reviewed, in amounts ranging from
$18,750 to $37,500. Short term renewals are assessed against 21 of the 22 stations receiving forfeitures. Radio broadcasters
will be ``contributing'' a total of $325,000 to the Federal Treasury as a result of our actions today. I am troubled
by the amount of these forfeitures and the increased use of the short term renewal as a sanction. Yet, I recognize that,
at least with respect to the increased forfeiture amounts, Congress increased our forfeiture authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I would have much preferred an approach that would have served three compelling goals: (1) Ensuring compliance with
our EEO rules by imposing meaningful sanctions; (2) imposing these sanctions in such a way so as not to cripple broadcasters
in their travels along the information superhighway; and (3) directly furthering the underlying public interest
purpose of the EEO rule_the increased hiring and promotion of minorities and women in the broadcast industry. Specifically,
if we had the legal authority to do so, I would have voted for a program that would have allowed monies received as a result
of violations or alleged violations of our EEO or other rules to be placed into a fund and not into the Federal Treasury.
Funds received for EEO violations would be used for training, educating, and providing placement services for minorities
and women interested in a career in broadcast. What better use for the $325,000 in forfeitures imposed for violations
of the EEO rules today than for the very purpose underlying the rule?

<DOCTITLE>Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; Request for an Exemption From Tying Provisions</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio (Banc One), has requested, pursuant to section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company
Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Section 106(b)), that the Board grant an exemption to permit Banc One's subsidiary banks to vary the consideration
on a loan, deposit, discount, or trust service (``traditional banking products'') for customers that receive first
lien mortgage loans on 1-4 family residential real estate (mortgage loans) from Banc One's mortgage subsidiary,
Banc One Mortgage Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana (BOMC). Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit
BOMC to vary the consideration on mortgage loans for customers who have obtained or will obtain a traditional banking
product from any of Banc One's subsidiary banks. BOMC originates and refinances mortgage loans, primarily for sale
into the secondary market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, Banc One intends to reorganize BOMC as an operating subsidiary of Bank One, Indianapolis, N.A., Indianapolis,
Indiana. In this connection, Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit its banks and BOMC to continue to offer
customers the price reductions described above after the reorganization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106(b) permits a bank to fix or vary the consideration for extending credit or furnishing services on condition
that a customer also obtain a traditional banking product from that bank. However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank
from engaging in these same activities on condition that the customer obtain any additional credit or services from
any affiliate. The Board may grant an exception that is not contrary to the purposes of this provision.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Banc One contends that its proposal is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because the proposal is not anticompetitive.
Banc One argues that the market for mortgage loans and for traditional banking products is highly competitive, and
that BOMC does not have sufficient market share on a local, nationwide, or other basis to adversely affect competition.
Banc One also argues that the proposal will promote competition and will not limit the availability of products to
consumers because the traditional banking products offered by Banc One's subsidiary banks and mortgage loans from
BOMC will be separately available to customers.

 A White House Conference on Aging is intended to produce policy recommendations to guide national aging policy over
the next decade. In Public Law 102&hyph;375, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1992, Congress specifically identified
six primary purposes for the White House Conference on Aging. They are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) To increase public awareness of the interdependence of generations and the essential contributions of older
individuals to society for the well-being of all generations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To identify the problems facing older individuals and the commonalities of the problems with problems of younger
generations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To examine the well-being of older individuals, including the impact the wellness of older individuals has on
our aging society;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for executive and legislative action as may be appropriate
for maintaining and improving the well-being of the aging;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) To develop recommendations for the coordination of Federal policy with State and local needs and the implementation
of such recommendations; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) To review the status and multigenerational value of recommendations adopted at previous White House Conferences
on Aging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that particular emphasis should be directed to purposes 1 and 5 listed above.

Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for the White House Conference on Aging to consider recognizing a local activity, event or program, it must
meet the following basic criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) It must be a policy-oriented event; the focus must be on one or more Federal policy issues affecting the elderly
or the near-elderly;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) It must guarantee the participation of older persons;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) It must produce a written report within 30&hyph;45 days summarizing major issues discussed and recommendations
proposed that can be utilized by the White House Conference on Aging;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) It must not be a profit-making or fundraising event although it is permissible to charge a fee to recover the costs
of the event; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) It must be approved by the Executive Director. If the White House Conference on Aging agrees to recognize the event,
an official letter will be provided that could be presented at the activity, event or program. In certain limited instances,
the White House Conference on Aging may also be able to participate. A White House Conference on Aging recognition
allows the activity, event or program to publicize that it has been recognized by the WHCOA and that it will be listed
in the final report of the Conference. However, recognition does not imply that the WHCOA endorses the recommendations.

Under the provisions of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the National Center on Child Abuse
and Neglect (NCCAN) of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting clearance from the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for instruments to be used for the Site Visit Interview Component of the National Evaluation
of Emergency Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services Demonstration Projects. The Emergency Services Demonstration
projects were designed to address services to families experiencing the coexisting problems of substance abuse
and child maltreatment.

Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Emergency Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services Demonstration projects, funded by the National Center
on Child Abuse and Neglect of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), were designed to address services
to families experiencing the coexisting problems of substance abuse and child maltreatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national evaluation is comprised of two primary components_the Site Visit Interview Component and the Document
Review Component. The site visit data, in conjunction with information obtained from reviews of program reports
and third-party evaluation documents (obtained from the Document Review component) will be used to assess the extent
to which demonstration programs have met the goals of (1) developing emergency service delivery models to provide
crisis intervention for children and adolescents at risk for maltreatment from substance-abusing family members;
and (2) removing barriers to treatment for substance-abusing parents or family members in order to prevent maltreatment
of children in these at-risk households. The Site Visit Interview Component will be conducted through visits to 49
projects and interviews with key members at the project site. The information obtained by the Site Visit Interview
Component will be used by NCCAN in decision-making regarding policy and programs pertaining to services to children
and families experiencing the coexisting problems of substance abuse and child maltreatment. The information also
will provide the fields of substance abuse and child abuse prevention and intervention with new models for working
together and for serving families from a holistic perspective.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Program Issuances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
which pay for health care and related services for 36 million Medicare beneficiaries and 33 million Medicaid recipients.
Administration of these programs involves (1) Providing information to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients,
health care providers, and the public; and (2) effective communications with regional offices, State governments,
State Medicaid Agencies, State Survey Agencies, various providers of health care, fiscal intermediaries and carriers
who process claims and pay bills, and others. To implement the various statutes on which the programs are based, we
issue regulations under authority granted the Secretary under sections 1102, 1871, and 1902 and related provisions
of the Social Security Act (the Act) and also issue various manuals, memoranda, and statements necessary to administer
the programs efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1871(c)(1) of the Act requires that we publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least every 3 months a list of all Medicare manual instructions, interpretive rules, statements of policy, and
guidelines of general applicability not issued as regulations. We published our first notice June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21730).
Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing of operational and policy
statements, we are continuing our practice of including Medicare substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed
and final) published during the 3-month timeframe. Since the publication of our quarterly listing on June 12, 1992
(57 FR 24797), we decided to add Medicaid issuances to our quarterly listings. Accordingly, we are listing in this
notice Medicaid issuances and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations published from October 1 through
December 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Medicare Coverage Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We receive numerous inquiries from the general public about whether specific items or services are covered under
Medicare. Providers, carriers, and intermediaries have copies of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual, which identifies
those medical items, services, technologies, or treatment procedures that can be paid for under Medicare. On August
21, 1989, we published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 34555) that contained all the Medicare coverage decisions issued in that manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that notice, we indicated that revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual will be published at least quarterly in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We also sometimes issue proposed or final national coverage decision changes in separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices. Readers should find this an easy way to identify both issuance changes to all our manuals and the text of changes
to the Coverage Issues Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual are not published on a regular basis but on an as-needed basis. We publish revisions
as a result of technological changes, medical practice changes, responses to inquiries we receive seeking clarifications,
or the resolution of coverage issues under Medicare. If no Coverage Issues Manual revisions were published during
a particular quarter, our listing will reflect that fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not all revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual contain major changes. As with any instruction, sometimes minor clarifications
or revisions are made within the text. We have reprinted manual revisions as transmitted to manual holders. The new
text is shown in italics. We will not reprint the table of contents, since the table of contents serves primarily as
a finding aid for the user of the manual and does not identify items as covered or not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. How To Use the Addenda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is organized so that a reader may review the subjects of all manual issuances, memoranda, substantive
and interpretive regulations, or coverage decisions published during the timeframe to determine whether any are
of particular interest. We expect it to be used in concert with previously published notices. Most notably, those
unfamiliar with a description of our Medicare manuals may wish to review Table I of our first three notices (53 FR 21730,
53 FR 36891, and 53 FR 50577) and the notice published March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16837), and those desiring information on
the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual may wish to review the August 21, 1989, publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To aid the reader, we have organized and divided this current listing into five addenda. Addendum I identifies updates
that changed the Coverage Issues Manual. We published notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that included the text of changes to the Coverage Issues Manual. These updates, when added to material from the manual
published on August 21, 1989, constitute a complete manual as of March 31, 1993. Parties interested in obtaining a
copy of the manual and revisions should follow the instructions in section IV of this notice.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 documents that contain a description of all previously published HCFA Medicare and Medicaid manuals and memoranda.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addendum III of this notice lists, for each of our manuals or Program Memoranda, a HCFA transmittal number unique to
that instruction and its subject matter. A transmittal may consist of a single instruction or many. Often it is necessary
to use information in a transmittal in conjunction with information currently in the manuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addendum IV lists all substantive and interpretive Medicare and Medicaid regulations and general notices published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 during the quarter covered by this notice. For each item, we list the date published, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 citation, the title of the regulation, and the Parts of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which have changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addendum V sets forth the revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual that were published during the quarter
covered by this notice. For the revisions, we give a brief synopsis of the revisions as they appear on the transmittal
sheet, the manual section number, and the title of the section. We present a complete copy of the revised material,
no matter how minor the revision, and identify the revisions by printing in italics the text that was changed. If the
transmittal includes material unrelated to the revised section, for example, when the addition of revised material
causes other sections to be repaginated, we do not reprint the unrelated material.

D. HCFA's Compact Disk-Read Only Memory (CD&hyph;ROM) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA's laws, regulations, and manuals are now available on CD&hyph;ROM, which may be purchased from GPO or NTIS on
a subscription or single copy basis. The Superintendent of Documents list ID is HCLRM, and the stock number is 717&hyph;139&hyph;00000&hyph;3.
The following material is contained on the CD&hyph;ROM disk: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Titles XI, XVIII, and XIX of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA-related regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA manuals and monthly revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA program memoranda.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The titles are current as of the September 1, 1992, update of the Compilation of the Social Security Laws and the regulations
are those in effect as of October 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CD&hyph;ROM disk does not contain Appendices M (Interpretative Guidelines for Hospices) and R (Resident Assessment
for Long Term Care Facilities) of the State Operations Manual. Copies of these appendices may be reviewed at a Federal
Depository Library (FDL). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any cost report forms incorporated in the manuals are included on the CD-ROM disk as LOTUS files. LOTUS software is
needed to view the reports once the files have been copied to a personal computer disk.

V. How To Review Listed Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transmittals or Program Memoranda can be reviewed at a local FDL. Under the FDL program, government publications
are sent to approximately 1400 designated libraries throughout the United States. Interested parties may examine
the documents at any one of the FDLs. Some may have arrangements to transfer material to a local library not designated
as an FDL. To locate the nearest FDL, individuals should contact any library. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, individuals may contact regional depository libraries, which receive and retain at least one copy of
most Federal government publications, either in printed or microfilm form, for use by the general public. These libraries
provide reference services and interlibrary loans; however, they are not sales outlets. Individuals may obtain
information about the location of the nearest regional depository library from any library. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Superintendent of Documents numbers for each HCFA publication are shown in Addendum III, along with the HCFA publication
and transmittal numbers. To help FDLs locate the instruction, use the Superintendent of Documents number, plus the
HCFA transmittal number. For example, to find the Carriers Manual, Part 2_Program Administration (HCFA&hyph;Pub.
14&hyph;2) transmittal entitled ``The Contractor Performance Evaluation Program_FY 1993,'' use the Superintendent
of Documents No. HE 22.8/7&hyph;3, and the HCFA transmittal number 123.

VI. General Information

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 65&hyph;15, Artificial Hearts and Related Devices, is revised to provide coverage of the FDA-approved ventricular
assist device (known as the BVS 5000) when used only in patients suffering from postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction.
The device is intended for short term use and is not covered when used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
There are several devices either in use or under development which replace all or part of the human heart or assist the
heart in performing its pumping function. Artificial hearts are considered investigational and not covered under
Medicare either when used as a permanent replacement for a human heart or when used as temporary life-support systems
(i.e., until a human heart becomes available for transplant). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The FDA-approved ventricular assist device (known as the BVS 5000) is covered when it is used in accordance with its
FDA-approved labeled uses for postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction. The device is intended for short term use
and is not covered when used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Other ventricular assist devices used as temporary
life-support systems are still considered investigational and not covered under the Medicare program.

Section 60&hyph;4.B, Medical Documentation, is revised to reflect changes mandated by &sect;4152 of OBRA 1990,
effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 1991. Implementing changes were published in the Medicare
Carriers Manual in July 1991 (transmittal 1399). Transmittal No. 66; section 60&hyph;4.C, Laboratory Evidence.
CHANGED PROCEDURES_EFFECTIVE DATE: 10/27/93. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 60&hyph;4.C, Laboratory Evidence, is revised to indicate that in situations where the arterial blood gas
and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting, the
arterial blood gas study is the preferred service of documenting medical need because the results of such studies
are considered the best evidence of hypoxemia. In addition, these instructions also clarify that the prohibition
against the use of results of tests performed by a durable medical equipment (DME) supplier to qualify patients for
home oxygen service 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
does not extend 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the results of an arterial blood gas text by a hospital certified to conduct such tests.

Medical Documentation._Initial 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
claims for oxygen services must include a completed Form HCFA&hyph;484 (Attending Physician's Certification of
Medical Necessity for Home Oxygen Therapy) to establish whether coverage criteria are met and to ensure that the oxygen
services provided are consistent with the physician's prescription or other medical documentation. The attending
physician's prescription or other medical documentation must indicate that the other forms of treatment (e.g.,
medical and physical therapy directed at secretions, bronchospasm and infection) have been tried, have not been
sufficiently successful, and oxygen therapy is still required. While there is no substitute for oxygen therapy,
each patient must receive optimum therapy before long-term home oxygen therapy is ordered. Use Form HCFA&hyph;484
for recertifications. (See Medicare Carriers Manual &sect;3312 for completion of Form HCFA&hyph;484.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The medical and prescription information on Form HCFA&hyph;484 can be completed only by the attending physician
or entered on the form from information in the patient's records by an employee of the physician for the physician's
review and signature. Although hospital discharge coordinators, nurses, and medical social workers may assist
in arranging for physician-prescribed home oxygen, they have no authority to prescribe the services or to enter medical
or prescription information in items 1 through 6 of Form HCFA&hyph;484. Suppliers may not enter this information
either. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike other types of DME, a physician's certification of medical necessity for oxygen equipment must include the
results of specific testing before coverage can be determined.

Initial claims for oxygen must also be supported by medical documentation. Separate documentation is used with electronic
billing. (See Medicare Carriers Manual, Part 3, &sect;4105.6.) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This documentation may be in the form of a prescription written by the patient's attending physician who has recently
examined the patient (normally within a month of the start of therapy) and must specify: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A diagnosis of the disease requiring home use of oxygen; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The oxygen flow rate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An estimate of the frequency, duration of use (e.g., 2 liters per minute, 10 minutes per hour, 12 hours per day),
and duration of need (e.g., 6 months or lifetime).

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A prescription for ``Oxygen PRN'' or ``Oxygen as needed'' does not meet this last requirement. Neither provides any

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All claims with oxygen flow rates of more than 2 liters per minute must be reviewed by a carrier's medical staff before
payment can be made. The attending physician may also specify the type of oxygen delivery system to be used (i.e., gas,
liquid, or concentrator). If the type of system is specified, then the medical reasons for selecting that system over
the alternative systems must also be specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New medical documentation written by the patient's attending physician must be submitted to the carrier in support
of revised oxygen requirements when there has been a change in the patient's condition and need for oxygen therapy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carriers are required to conduct periodic, continuing medical necessity reviews on patients whose conditions warrant
these reviews and on patients with indefinite or extended periods of necessity as described in Medicare Carriers
Manual, Part 3, &sect;4105.6.C. When indicated, carriers may also request documentation of the results of a repeat
arterial blood gas or oximetry study.

Section 4152 of OBRA 1990 requires earlier recertification and retesting of oxygen patients who begin coverage with
an arterial blood gas result at or above a partial pressure of 55 or an arterial oxygen saturation percentage at or above
89. (See Medicare Carriers Manual &sect;4105.6 for certifications and retesting schedules.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Laboratory Evidence._Initial claims for oxygen therapy must also include the results of a blood gas study that
has been ordered and evaluated by the attending physician. This is usually in the form of a measurement of the partial
pressure of oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood. (See Medicare Carriers Manual, Part 3, &sect;2070.1 for instructions
on clinical laboratory tests.) A measurement of arterial oxygen saturation obtained by ear or pulse oximetry, however,
is also acceptable when ordered and evaluated by the attending physician and performed under his or her supervision
or when performed by a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services. In situations when the arterial blood
gas and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for home oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting,
the arterial blood gas study is the preferred source of documenting medical need. A DME supplier is not considered
a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services for purposes of these guidelines. This prohibition does
not extend to the results of an arterial blood gas test conducted by a hospital certified to do such tests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditions under which the laboratory tests are performed must be specified in writing and submitted with the
initial claim, i.e., at rest, while sleeping, while exercising, on room air, or if while on oxygen, the amount, body
position during testing, and similar information necessary for interpreting the evidence as specified by the carrier.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferred sources of laboratory evidence are existing physician and/or hospital records that reflect the patient's
medical condition. Since it is expected that virtually all patients who qualify for home oxygen coverage for the first
time under these guidelines have recently been discharged from a hospital where they submitted to arterial blood
gas tests, the carrier needs to request that such test results be submitted in support of their initial claims for home
oxygen. If more than one arterial blood gas test is performed during the patient's hospital stay, the test result obtained
closest to the hospital discharge date is the best evidence of the need for home oxygen therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carriers may accept an attending physician's statement of recent hospital test results for a particular patient,
when appropriate, in lieu of copies of actual hospital records. Subsequent blood gas tests that appear to duplicate
the hospital test (e.g., when there is no reason to believe the patient's condition may have changed) are denied as
not medically reasonable and necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A repeat arterial blood gas or oximetry study is normally necessary only when evidence indicates that an oxygen recipient
has undergone a major change relevant to home use of oxygen. For example, if the carrier has reason to believe that there
has been a major change in the patient's physical condition (e.g., when there has been a significant increase in the
amount of oxygen billed on a monthly basis), it may ask for documentation of the results of another blood gas or oximetry
study.

Project Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following project requirements, which were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in FY 1989, after public comment dated September 8, 1989, 54 FR 37378, will be continued in FY 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project requirements are designed to direct Federal resources where the greatest needs exist. Each project must
define a geographic region and identify the types of providers to be targeted for training within that region. Thus,
the focus in FY 1994 will continue to be on clinical education of primary care providers in high HIV/AIDS prevalence
areas. Consistent with this emphasis is the requirement that a minimum of two-thirds of the Federal funds provided
must be expended to provide education to primary care providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, dentists, physician
assistants, nurse practitioners, and dental hygienists). In addition, at least 50 percent of project funds must
be expended for training activities in high AIDS incidence Metropolitan Statistical Areas identified prior to the
competitive awards of high AIDS incidence MSAs identified for funding through the ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each ETC must provide or perform the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Clinical training of primary care physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants,

Final Strategic Directions for AETC Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AIDS Education Training Centers program was initially designed to provide information on the prevalence of AIDS
and identification of groups at increased risk of HIV infection. As the HIV/AIDS epidemic matured, it became apparent
that the AETCs had to shift their priorities from HIV/AIDS information transfer to more intensive clinical training.
This shift was necessitated by the introduction of new therapeutic interventions, such as antiretroviral therapies,
which offered the promise of delaying the onset of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. The mission of
the AETCs is to address the ever increasing issues surfacing because of the changes in the HIV epidemic by constantly
adding new priorities to address new issues. The Bureau of Health Professions and the Division of Medicine have developed
new strategic directions which will have to be more fully incorporated into the priorities of the AETC program. These
strategic directions were published for public comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 18, 1993, 58 FR 60860. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. These strategic directions
will include an emphasis on generalism, a continued emphasis on minorities and the underserved and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasis on interdisciplinary training. The AETCs will continue to provide multidisciplinary training for primary
health care personnel in the care of people with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and other conditions
related to infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alamosa springsnail and Socorro springsnail were listed as endangered on October 30, 1991. The draft recovery
plan includes new scientific information about the two species gathered since 1991 and provides management procedures
for protecting their habitat and expanding their range and abundance to the extent that no natural or human-caused
disturbance will result in irrevocable losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Public Comments Solicited
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that Chapters 6, 7, 8 and 11 of NPS&hyph;48 (``The Concessions Guideline'') have been rescinded
effective as of the date of this publication. In addition, any portions of NPS&hyph;48 or other NPS policies which
are inconsistent with recently amended National Park Service regulations for concession contracting and its new
standard language concession contract are hereby rescinded. Matters previously addressed by Chapters 6, 7, 8 and
11 of NPS&hyph;48 are now addressed to the extent necessary by a new National Park Service internal staff manual entitled
``Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines'' effective as of the date of this publication. The Sample Prospectus
and Related Guidelines is incorporated by reference in this public notice. The document includes, among other matters,
a sample prospectus for solicitation of offers for National Park Service concession contracts and permits, related

As an internal staff manual, notice of the Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines is not required to be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nor is public comment on it required to be sought. However, in order to assure that the views of all interested parties
are considered, the National Park Service is seeking public comment on its Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines
document and will consider all comments received and amend the document appropriately if public comments so warrant.
Delaying the effective date of this document until after consideration of public comments is not in the public interest
as there exists a large backlog of NPS concession contract renewals which are necessary to complete to allow the commencement
of major renovation and construction programs in areas of the national park system, including improvements necessary
to protect the health and safety of park visitors and NPS and concessioner employees. In addition, many concessioners
are now operating under the terms of expired contracts and are, accordingly, in need of contract renewal actions as
soon as possible to permit business planning, actions and investments which require the existence of a new contract
for implementation. It is also noted that the Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines document is intended to provide
guidance to NPS personnel concerning possible means to implement new policies and procedures adopted in the new NPS
concession contracting regulations and new standard language concession contract, both of which were adopted after
extensive public comment periods and consideration by NPS of all comments received. Further public comment in advance
of implementation of this internal staff manual is therefore not considered necessary and is impracticable if the
contract renewal process is to commence in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines document is intended to be only a sample document. It is not meant to be
a document which must be used as written in every instance. It may be modified as appropriate to fit the needs of individual
situations. Further, this document is expected to be modified and refined over time as experience indicates that
changes are needed and to meet the changing needs of the concession contracting program.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, announces proposed availability
of Fiscal Year (FY) 94 funds to support a limited number of research grants to educational institutions. These funds
may also be used to support professional meetings and conferences for the exchange and transfer of research concepts
and findings related to the safety of nuclear power production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FY 94 ceiling for research grants to educational institutions is approximately $1,218,000.00. Of this amount,
approximately $817,000.00 will be available for new grants. Because of this limitation, proposed grant budgets
should be restricted to about $50,000.00 per year, with total project funding not exceeding $100,000.00 over a two-year
period. Proposals for new FY 94 research grants should be submitted between the date of this Notice and May 20, 1994.
Proposals received after May 20, 1994 will be considered for FY 94 funding to the extent practicable.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 27, 1993, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice that announced the proposed availability of FY 93 funds for the NRC Grant Program. The NRC is revising that
notice to provide information on their grant program for FY 94. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope and Purpose of This Announcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 31.a and 141.b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory
Research proposes to support educational institutions, nonprofit entities, state and local governments, and professional
societies through providing funds for expansion, exchange and transfer of knowledge, ideas, and concepts directed
toward the NRC safety research program. The program includes, but is not limited to, support of professional meetings
and conferences. In addition, the NRC has a limited amount for research grants to educational institutions (see topics
below). The FY 94 ceiling for these grants is approximately $1,218,000.00 with approximately $871,000.00 of this
amount available for new grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this program is to stimulate research to provide a technological base for the safety assessment of system
and subsystem technologies used in nuclear power applications. The results of this program will be to increase public
understanding relating to nuclear safety, to pool the funds of theoretical and practical knowledge and technical
information, and ultimately to enhance the protection of the public health and safety. In addition, each grant to
an educational institution should contain elements which will potentially benefit the graduate research program
of the institution, e.g., graduate student training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC encourages educational institutions to submit research grant proposals in the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Experiments and predictive modeling for thermal stratification, thermal stripping and flow-induced vibration
in plant fluid systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Evaluation and modeling of phenomena associated with the addition of cooling water to a degraded core during various
stages of a severe accident.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Educational institutions, nonprofit entities, State and Local governments, and professional societies are eligible
to apply for a grant under this announcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Factors Generally Indicating Support Through Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC's benefit from the results of grants should be no greater than for other interested parties, i.e., the public
must be the primary beneficiary of the work performed. Surveys, studies, or research which provide specific information
or data necessary for the NRC to exercise its regulatory or research mission responsibilities will not be funded by
a grant. Applicants requesting support for work which has a direct regulatory application should submit their requests
as an unsolicited proposal for consideration as a contract rather than a grant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The primary purpose of NRC grants is to support the development of knowledge or understanding of the subject or phenomena
under study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The exact course of the work and its outcome are usually not defined precisely, and specific points in time for achievement
of significant results need not be specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The NRC desires that the nature of the proposed investigation be such that the recipient will bear prime responsibility
for the conduct of the research and exercise judgment and original thought toward attaining the scientific goals
within broad parameters of the proposed research areas and the resources provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Meaningful technical reports (as distinguished from Semi-Annual Status Reports) can be prepared only as new findings
are made, rather than on a predetermined time schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Simplicity and economy in execution and administration are mutually desirable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposal Format
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals should be concise and provide a thorough understanding of the proposed project. Neither unduly elaborate
applications nor voluminous supporting documentation is desired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local governments shall submit proposals utilizing the standard forms specified in Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;102 (Revised), Paragraph 6.c). Nonprofit organizations, universities, and professional
societies shall submit proposals utilizing the standard forms stipulated in OMB Circular A-110, (Attachment M).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is valid for Federal Government Fiscal Year 94 (October 1, 1998 to September 30, 1994). Potential grantees
are advised, however, that due to the limited funding available for new research grants to educational institutions,
such proposals received after May 20, 1994, will be considered for FY94 funding to the extent practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Fiscal Year 94, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, anticipates
making a total of approximately $1,218,000.00 available for funding research grants to educational institutions.
Of this amount, approximately $817,000.00 will be available for new research grants in FY94. Because of this limitation,
proposed grant budgets should be restricted to about $50,000.00 per year, with total project funding not exceeding
$100,000.00 over a period of two years.

Notice of intent to amend Source Material License SUA&hyph;1473 to modify the erosion protection design of the plan
for reclamation of the Ambrosia Lake Mill disposal area, and Notice of Opportunity to request a hearing.

1. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 7, 1994, Quivira Mining Company (QMC), holder of Source Material License SUA&hyph;1473 for
the Ambrosia Lake Mill, requested an amendment to License Condition No. 37 to; (1) Eliminate having to open a new rock
quarry and its related surface disturbance; (2) improve the erosion protection for the tailings impoundments; and
(3) reduce the volume of waste rock generated at the crusher and thereby reduce the disturbance in that area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Reason for Request To Amend License
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
License Condition No. 37 describes requirements that the licensee must comply with in reclaiming the site. As discussed,
below, QMC is requesting modifications to this license condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that rock used for erosion protection have the ability to withstand
the forces of weathering for long periods of time. In accordance with this requirement, in the approved reclamation
plan, QMC provided evidence that rock from an area known as La Chuchilla Ridge would meet the NRC criteria. To assure
that this rock source is actually used to obtain rock for erosion protection, License Condition No. 37(J) specifically
mentions that erosion protection materials must be obtained from La Chuchilla Ridge. QMC is requesting that License
Condition 37(J) be revised to allow them to obtain rock from an existing quarry near the Homestake Mill in order to prevent
having to disturb the La Chuchilla Ridge area. The durability of rock at the Homestake Quarry has been shown to be equivalent
to the rock from La Chuchilla Ridge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
License Condition No. 37(K) specifies the gradation and sizing requirements of the rock to be used for erosion protection.
For the outslopes of Ponds 1 and 2, four sizes of rock are required depending on where the rock is to be placed. In order
not to have to process four different gradation sizes, QMC proposes to use larger rock than required in two areas of
the outslopes. This would not only improve the erosion protection design, but would also reduce the disturbance in
the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approved reclamation plans does not require rock for erosion protection of the top surfaces of Ponds 1 and 2 as the
surfaces are sufficiently flat to be stable under extreme flood conditions. QMC proposes to be allowed to place rock
on the top surfaces of the two ponds if they so desire. This request would also improve the erosion protection design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 10 CFR 51.22 (c)(11), categorically excludes the requirement for an environmental assessment for this
licensing action. That paragraph states that the categorical exclusion applies to the issuance of amendments to
licenses for uranium mills provided that (1) there is no significant change in the types or significant increase in
the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, (2) there is no significant increase in individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure, (3) there is no significant construction impact, and (4) there is no significant
increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensing action discussed in this memorandum meets these criteria as the proposed amendment involves only changes
in the erosion protection design. The proposed changes will provide larger rock than required in some areas, and will
eliminate disturbing a new area for obtaining rock by using an existing quarry. Neither of these changes will result
in adverse environmental impacts. An environmental report is not required from the licensee since the amendment
does not meet the criteria of 10 CFR 51.60 (b)(2).

<DOCTITLE>The University of Washington; Consideration of Application for Renewal of Facility License</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73,
as a possession only license from the present operating license, issued to the University of Washington for the Argonaut
reactor located on the campus of the University in Seattle, Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The renewal would extend the expiration date of Facility License No. R&hyph;73 to February 14, 1999, in accordance
with the licensee's timely application for renewal as a possession only license by letter dated August 3, 23 and 31,
1989 and as modified on February 14, 1994. The operating license was modified by Amendment No. 15 to the license on May
7, 1990, to not permit possession of fuel on the site since all fuel had been removed from the facility and returned to
its owner, the Department of Energy. The licensee is developing a plan to decommission the facility, and it is anticipated
that the term of renewal will be sufficient to complete decommissioning and terminate the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to a decision to renew the license as a possession only license, the Commission will have made findings required
by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By April 18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to renewal of the subject facility license
and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding
must file a written request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene. Requests for hearing and petitions for
leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing
Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. If a request
for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary of the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 325&hyph;6000 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and

 notice. A copy of that petition should also be sent to the Office of General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555 and to Ms. Christine Hughes, Division Chief and Special Assistant to the Attorney General, University
of Washington, 101 Administration, MS: AF&hyph;50, Seattle, Washington 98195, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

 which consisted of a waiver of $99 of the $100 fee charged to members for excess Networking position files. That filing
indicated that the waiver would continue while NSCC determined a more appropriate fee. The purpose of the proposed
rule change is to establish a revised fee for the Networking position records. The new fee structure is based on the
number of records received by a participating broker and the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on the system.
Effective January 1, 1994, for billing in February 1994, the new fee is $1.50 per thousand records received by a broker
in excess of the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on Networking. NSCC will not assess a charge when the difference
between these numbers is 5000 records or less in a month.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 29, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE is proposing to adopt a set of Chinese Wall procedures relating to Exchange specialists and specialist firms.
The test of the proposed rule change is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 4.19(a). A functional separation must be established (1) between a specialist firm and any associated approved
person; and (2) between a specialist and any associated integrated member organization. The approved person or integrated
member organization (collectively referred to as an ``affiliated upstairs firm'') must establish functional separation
(a ``Chinese Wall'') as appropriate to its operation and further establish, maintain and enforce written procedures
reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information, which includes review of employee
and proprietary trading, memorization and documentation of procedures, substantive supervision of interdepartmental
communications by the Exchange specialist firm's Compliance Department and procedures concerning proprietary
trading when the firm is in possession of material, non-public information. The Exchange specialist firm or associated
integrated member organization must obtain the prior written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the
requirements above in establishing functional separation as appropriate to the operation and that it has established
proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation. A copy of these Chinese
Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange's Financial Compliance Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The following are the minimum procedural and maintenance requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The specialist's book must be kept confidential in accordance with Rule 5.29(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The affiliated upstairs firm can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the affiliated upstairs firm from the issuer
may not be made available to the specialist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in
such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated upstairs firm and specialist
entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Information that may be made available to others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm may make available to the specialist only the market information
that he or she would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal course of his or her trading and ``market
probing'' activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A specialist may make known to a broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm only has the information about
market conditions in specialty stocks that he or she would make available in the normal course of specializing to any
other broker and in the same manner as it would make such information available to any other broker. The specialist
may make such market information available only upon request of the broker of the affiliated upstairs firm and may
not provide such information on its own initiative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An affiliated upstairs firm can popularize a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the
existence of possible conflicts of interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A specialist who becomes privy to material, non-public information must communicate that fact promptly to his
or her firm's compliance officer or other designated official. The specialist shall seek guidance from the compliance
officer or other designated official as to what procedures the specialist should follow after receipt of such information
or such other action that should be taken. Appropriate records shall be maintained by the compliance officer or other
designated official. The record should include a summary of the information received by the specialist and a description
of the action taken by the compliance officer or other designated official. If the ``book'' is given up to another member
of the specialist firm who is not in possession of the information or an independent specialist firm, the book must
be transferred in a neutral fashion to ensure that the transfer itself does not disclose the material, non-public
information and the Exchange must be immediately informed and a record kept of the time the specialist reacquired
the book reflecting acknowledgement by the compliance officer that the reacquisition was appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Exchange has established the following procedures to monitor compliance with this rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Examination of the Chinese Wall procedures established by Exchange specialist firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated upstairs firm and its affiliated specialist or
specialist firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Exchange will conduct periodic examinations of the specialist firm's Chinese Wall procedures
to ensure that a functional separation between the affiliated upstairs firm and the specialist or specialist firm
has been created and thereafter maintained. The Exchange will also monitor the trading activities of affiliated
upstairs firms and affiliated specialists in the firms' specialty stock in order to monitor the possible trading
while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison reports
generated by the Exchange,

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office
of Management and Budget have commenced a project to identify, recommend and help implement specific reforms of the
regulatory process in order to ease the impact of government regulations on small businesses. Six Federal agencies
are participating in the initial phase of the project: The Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department
of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Food and Drug Administration.
The project will begin with a Small Business Forum on Regulatory Reform to be held on March 17, 1994 in Washington, DC.
This Forum will consist of a panel of senior representatives from the six agencies, chaired by Erskine B. Bowles, Administrator
of the SBA, and Sally Katzen, Administrator of OIRA. They will listen to oral presentations from several members of
the small business community and from SBA's Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy. They also will be reviewing written
statements submitted by other business owners who were unable to present their remarks to the Forum panel in person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forum will be followed by an examination of the cumulative impact of regulations on five designated industries,
representatives from various Federal regulatory agencies, with specific direction from those agencies participating
on the Forum panel. By this Notice, SBA and OIRA announce that they are seeking written comments from interested members
of the public to assist in successful completion of this project. These written comments will be considered by the
five industry working groups in preparing reports to be presented at a second Small Business Forum, to be held in late
June 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866, issued on September 30, 1993, announces a government-wide commitment to regulatory reform
and meaningful public participation in the regulatory process and directs the development of ``streamlined regulatory
approaches for small businesses and other entities.'' To this end, SBA and OIRA have initiated a project to bring together
representatives of six Federal agencies for the purpose of identifying burdens imposed by present regulatory procedures
and the means by which the regulatory process can be altered to facilitate participation by small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, the regulatory impact on small business of six Federal agencies will be examined: The Department of Labor,
the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal
Revenue Service, and the Food and Drug Administration. The burden of compliance with each agency's regulations will
be evaluated in terms of their individual and cumulative impact on small businesses in five discrete industry groups:
(1) Processing of food and related products; (2) trucking and transportation; (3) restaurants; (4) environmental
recycling and waste disposal; and (5) chemicals and metals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A working group will be established for each of the five industry groups, composed of representatives from the six
participating agencies, as well as representatives from SBA, OIRA and other Federal agencies. Each working group
will meet over a ten-week period and will solicit the input and meaningful participation of small business owners,
small business trade associations, State and local governments, and other interested parties, via oral presentations
and written comments received during the initial 45 days of the ten-week period. Each working group will prepare a
report with specific recommendations for improvements in the regulatory process and in any specific regulations
which appear to affect the particular industry in an unduly burdensome way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extensive public participation is essential to this evaluative process. This participation will occur at the public
Forum on March 17, 1994, and the second Forum in June of 1994. Each Forum will hear from representatives selected from
various sectors of the small business community and will be attended by senior representatives from the six participating
agencies. These agencies have stated publicly their commitment to working with each other and with members of the
small business community toward the goal of regulatory reform.

Broader public participation in the form of written comments is also essential to this process and is being solicited
through this Notice. Comments received by May 2, 1994 will be considered by the five industry working groups in preparing
the reports which then will be presented by SBA at the second Forum. Public comments should be as specific as possible
and should focus on possible constructive solutions to any problems presented. Each submission should identify
the industry affected, so as to facilitate a referral to the appropriate industry working group. SBA, OIRA and the
participating agencies are particularly interested in comments concerning the following:

On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard published, under this docket number, a notice of meeting and of availability of a study
on the safety of towing vessels. Now the Coast Guard has added topics to the agenda of that meeting: (1) Radar-observer
training for operators of uninspected towing vessels; (2) Coast Guard inspection of towing vessels; (3) manning
of towing vessels; (4) pilotage requirement for operators of towing vessels; (5) and evaluation of regulations on
retesting mariners. The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on the new topics as well as on the original agenda.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting on April 4, 1994, to consider the study, ``Review of Marine Safety Issues
Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels'' conducted by the Coast Guard, and will seek public comment on the recommendations
identified in the study. The Coast Guard may use the study, along with public comment, to develop rules. Of particular
interest, and likely to be the subject of expedited rulemaking, are measures that could provide the necessary means
to, and improve the navigational ability of, the operator; these measures include requiring the carriage of charts,
publications, and radar, and requiring the operator to be qualified as a radar observer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard recognizes that there are insufficient facilities for radar-observer training immediately available
to accommodate all currently licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTVs). Therefore, the Coast Guard
is contemplating for these OUTVs: (a) An interim, short-term, training program, required soon, followed by (b) a
more extensive program leading to an endorsement as radar observer, required on or before the scheduled license renewal.
The Coast Guard is contemplating for new applicants, only the more extensive program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the practicality and utility of these requirements, their costs, the content of both interim and extensive
courses, the length of time appropriate for implementation, and the administrative burden would be especially helpful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the topics that the Coast Guard has added_inspection, manning, pilotage of towing vessels, and evaluation
of retesting regulations_it added because of Congressional interest. This arose during the Secretary of Transportation's
testimony before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation, House of Representatives, on March 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments

Ford Motor Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, MI, determined that some of its replacement windshields failed to comply with
the labeling requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford also petitioned to
be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15
U.S.C. 1381 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on January 13, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR
1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code
for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January
26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that, with certain exceptions, glazing materials
for use in motor vehicles shall conform with Paragraphs S5, ``Requirements,'' S6, ``Certification and Marking,''
and ANS Z26.1.6, ``Marking of Safety Glazing Materials.'' Specifically, section 6 of ANSI Z26.1 states ``[G]lazing
materials, which in a single sheet of material are intentionally made with an area having a luminous transmittance
of not less than 70 percent (Test No. 2), adjoining an area that has less than 70 percent luminous transmittance, shall
be permanently marked at the edge of the sheet to show the limits of the area that is intended to comply with Test No. 2.
The markings shall be A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 98,000 W1099V windshields manufactured from June 1992 through October 1993 and 14,800 W911V windshields
manufactured from August 1992 to June 1993 are missing the A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
S1 marking at the bottom edge of the shade band. The subject windshields are manufactured as replacements for windshields
in 1980 through 1994 model year Ford F-Series and Bronco vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The affected windshields were produced by a Ford supplier without A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=3 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
S1 markings at the bottom edge of the shade band, but meet all other marking and performance requirements of Standard
No. 205 and ANSI Z26.1 including the appropriate AS1 marking in the area of the trademark identifying the type of construction
of the glazing material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Ford believes that t]he omission of the marking presents no risk of accident or injury. Consequently in Ford's judgment,
the omission is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The stated purposes of [Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard] FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary
degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants
being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted, the affected windshields fully comply
with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205 and although missing the A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=3 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
S1 marking at the bottom of the shade band, they do have the correct AS1 marking to indicate the type of construction
of the glazing material. Because all performance requirements are met, the omission of the marking at the shade band
has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended by the standard. Ford is not aware of any
complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were received on the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The noncompliance reported does not affect the performance characteristics of the glazing, and, hence, the noncompliance
has no direct effect upon motor vehicle safety. Although the markings have been omitted in one area of the windshield,
the correct designation, AS1, appears in the area of the trademark identifying the type of construction of the glazing
material. Thus, the omission at the shade band will not prevent correct identification of the glazing by personnel
conducting periodic motor vehicle inspections, or when it is necessary to replace the windshield. There is no need
in either instance for knowledge of where the area of 70 percent or greater light transmittance begins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance
herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397 (c)(3)(A)(i)(I),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397 (c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SE (Model ID 126.024) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz
300SE that Daimler Benz A.G. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 300SE to its U.S.-certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 300SE, as
originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified
counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1990 model 300SE is identical to the U.S.-certified
1990 model 300SE with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Information Agency (USIA) seeks applications
from non-profit organizations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area to coordinate and implement programs which
enhance the experience of international students attending colleges and universities in the Washington, DC area.
The recipient will develop programs which serve to familiarize international students with Washington's complex
cultural, political, and ethnic structures and provide a bridge between the campus environment and the community.
It will also provide off-campus services to international students visiting Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient will also provide support for Fulbright enrichment programs for foreign grantees in the Washington,
DC area. Enrichment programs should be designed primarily for Fulbright students, but may include teachers, senior
scholars, and other participants in programs supported by USIA. USIA anticipates awarding up to $70,000 for the implementation
and coordination of both these programs. This support is not intended to replace private efforts in this field but
rather to supplement such efforts with financial assistance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The IFLNN program is authorized by the Freedom Support Act of 1992 and funded under the Foreign Appropriations Bill
of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs' authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political
character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural
life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Institute at the IFLNN will expand the pool of Russians qualified in English and familiar with Western
business practices, finance, management, commercial transactions, and the American political and economic system
as an environment for business. This program will provide up to $500,000 to support an institutional linkage with
the IFLNN for three (3) years; start date for the program should be September, 1994, with faculty in place in Nizhniy
Novgorod not later than October 1, 1994. The U.S. partner institution will assist with the development of faculty
and curriculum in the fields of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), business, and American studies. Program activities
will include faculty and post-graduate student exchanges (post-graduates must be on a ``faculty track,'' involved
with teaching at participating institutions), and some outreach to the U.S./Russian business communities to involve
them in developing appropriate business curricula. The U.S. partner must dedicate significant staff and faculty
time to the project. The program will be implemented primarily through a grant to an accredited four-year U.S. post-secondary
institution or consortium of accredited institutions and scholarly/professional associations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nizhniy Novgorod has been the setting for key economic and democratic reform in Russia. U.S. presence in the area is
growing, including Peace Corps volunteers, U.S. business interests, and visiting USG officials. The focus of the
U.S. effort has been to build a ``critical mass'' for reform among regional and local government officials, business
leaders and educators. One element of this critical mass includes English language training for Russians which can
be used in their professional fields. To this end, the IFLNN program will help train a pool of language-qualified professionals,
enabling them to take advantage of expanded opportunities for technical assistance, bilateral exchanges, other
government and private sector training programs, and commercial relations.

Program Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IFLNN program has three principal objectives: (1) To focus additional resources in support of democratic and
market reform in Nizhniy Novgorod. English language teaching and American studies will be used as vehicles to teach
business English and American business practices, and American forms of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To establish a training center for faculty from other institutes of higher education. IFLNN's program will ``train
the trainers,'' emphasizing curriculum development, teacher training, and educational testing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) To facilitate the creation of a linkage between IFLNN and U.S. institutions of higher learning that will continue
to flourish after U.S. Government funding has ceased to be available.

Grant Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To achieve program objectives, the grantee institution/consortium will: (1) Help develop a structure for interdisciplinary
training programs in English as a Foreign Language (EFL), business and management practices, and American studies
at the IFLNN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Conduct faculty and post-graduate student* exchanges in EFL, business, and American studies. Each exchange
of persons must be a minimum of one month; however, longer visits, especially those involving faculty, are encouraged
and are an important competitive factor. (*Post-graduate students must be on a faculty track and must not exceed 25%
of all participants).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provide for a U.S. faculty member who must be in residence in Nizhniy Novgorod for the duration of the program as
program director to ensure everyday oversight of program details.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Arrange exchanges of other university personnel, including library and administrative officials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Implement exchanges of library materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Develop new curricula and teaching materials, emphasizing content-area language instruction and EFL methodology
developments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Develop testing methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Advise IFLNN administrators on management, budget, fundraising skills, and other areas needed to operate in
a decentralized environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Information Agency seeks applications from non-profit
organizations in the New York metropolitan area to coordinate and implement programs which enhance the experience
of self-sponsored international students attending colleges and universities in the New York City area. The organization
will develop programs that serve to familiarize international students with New York City's complex cultural, political,
and ethnic structures, and provide a bridge between the campus environment and American communities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be
balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Overall authority
for these programs is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law
87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States to increase
mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries; to strengthen the
ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and
achievements of the people of the United States and other nations and thus to assist in the development of friendly,
sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' Programs and
projects must conform with all Agency requirements and guidelines and are subject to final review by the USIA contracting
officer.

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through a grant to a non-profit organization in the New York city metropolitan area, USIA seeks programs that would
enable self-sponsored international students to experience the United States: Its history, culture, values, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 policies and lifestyles. Self-sponsored international students should be provided an opportunity to utilize the
city's resources productively; and to take an active role in city life. To understand more fully American life and
culture, students must be provided the opportunity to become personally involved with and understand ``typical''
American activities such as volunteerism, observance of national and religious holidays, and cultural and sports
events. In addition, self-sponsored international students should be encouraged to share their culture and knowledge
with American students at all levels. Also important are programs which introduce foreign students to the U.S. government
structure, the electoral process, the U.S. economy, business culture and trade issues, environmental protection,
the arts and American cultural heritage. A variety of approaches such as workshops, home hospitability, and community
outreach programs may be utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enrichment programs should be designed not only to enhance international students' understanding of America's
cultural and ethnic diversity, but they should also enable the students to teach Americans their own cultural, ethnic,
political, and social diversity, thereby promoting mutual understanding and long-term friendships. This multicultural
component can be met by emphasizing interaction_interpersonal, intercultural communication_between students
and American citizens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another focus of this program could be to identify international students having leadership potential whose experience
in this program could make a substantial contribution to mutual understanding and communication between the U.S.
and their home countries in the future. In this regard, workshops to develop such leadership skills as public speaking
and conflict resolution for future international leaders should be included in the program. Organizations must
provide a program outline demonstrating their ability to enlist the participation of informed lecturers, keynote
speakers, and/or recognized experts whose credentials and experience are evidence of in-depth knowledge of workshop
topics.

Program Implementation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To support the initial implementation of a comprehensive state-wide industrial extension program or the pilot testing
of new program and service concepts to help small and medium-sized manufacturers improve productivity and competitiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regional Linkages:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To support inter-state or multi-state efforts to expand the scope and enhance the effectiveness of technical assistance
services available regionally to small and medium-sized manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Planning projects are open to all states, regardless of state size, industrial density/sparseness, or number
of existing industrial assistance programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Program Implementation and Regional Linkages projects, NIST plans to give priority consideration to projects
having the best potential to benefit areas with relatively sparse distribution of industry, or low industry density
areas that do not lend themselves to large extension centers as a method of service delivery.

Program Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with the provisions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 2781), as amended,
NIST will provide assistance in fiscal year 1994 to help States develop manufacturing assistance programs aimed
at small and medium-sized manufacturers and help bring those State programs to a level of performance where they can
provide the full range of manufacturing extension services required by their manufacturers. Under the NIST Manufacturing
Extension Partnership (MEP), which includes the State Technology Extension Program (STEP), NIST will make merit-based
awards to States to help improve their planning, coordination, and implementation of their technology extension
activities. This funding will also be available to multi-state partnerships which seek to expand the scope of technology
assistance related services regionally available to small- and medium-sized manufacturers. MEP assumes a broad
definition of manufacturing, and recognizes a wide range of technology and concepts, including durable goods production;
chemical, biotechnology, and other materials processing; electronic component and system fabrication; and engineering
services associated with manufacturing, as lying within the definition of manufacturing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Funding Availability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Approximately, $2,500,000 will be available to support cooperative agreements on a matching funds basis under this
program. Funding size will vary according to the project category and scope of work. For example, Program Planning
projects have typically averaged less than $100,000 in past years. Program Planning projects that include pilot
testing of the proposed extension plan or planning for multiple intrastate regions will be eligible for NIST funding
up to $150,000. For Program Implementation projects and Regional Linkage projects, awards will also vary, but NIST
funds may not exceed $250,000 per project. States will be able to submit proposals for each of the three project categories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The purpose of Program Planning projects will be to create plans for state-wide, coordinated, technology extension
programs in order to enhance the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized manufacturers. These projects will
plan for the development and coordination of existing and/or newly formed services, such as state industrial assistance
programs; workforce training; university-based industrial assistance programs; and management assistance programs;
into a unified state-wide program. Plans will include providing access to a wide range of technology and services,
such as technology deployment, workers skills development, technology transfer and commercialization, or export
and market development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may conduct planning activities on multiple intrastate region basis, when regions are defined by the
state. Regions should be clearly defined by the proposing organizations and it must be clear why the program is regionally
oriented, versus state-wide, and how the multiple intrastate regions will be integrated into a state-wide plan or
interact such that state-wide coverage is achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may include pilot testing activities as part of their planning process. If pilot testing of the proposed
extension plan is included in the project, it should include methods of evaluating the pilot test's success in implementing
the proposed extension plan. Any proposed pilot activity must be consistent with the program plan developed for the
state.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Project Objective
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Program Implementation projects is to support the implementation of comprehensive, state-wide industrial
extension programs and/or pilot testing of new program and service concepts, such as pilot outreach centers and other
extention activities, to help small and medium-sized manufacturers improve productivity and competitiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For projects that support the implementation of a comprehensive state-wide industrial extension system, activities
must build upon existing services and be consistent with comprehensive state plans, if such plans exist. Extension
programs should provide access to a range of services, including but not limited to: technical extension, training,
manager assistance, and quality improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pilot testing of new services and activities will be permitted on a limited scale where there is an intent to replicate
these services on a larger scale or to move toward full-scale implementation. Accordingly, pilot testingmust include

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Regional Linkage projects is to support inter-state or multi-state partnerships that will expand
the scope and enhance the effectiveness of technical assistance services regionally available to small and medium-sized
manufacturers. Projects may be assistance service-led, or industry-led partnerships to provide assistance services
that cross institutional and political boundaries. Assistance service-led partnerships, for example, can include
shared assistance services that cross state boundaries, or electronic networking. Industry-led partnerships
can include linkage activities between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers, creating a multi-state
network of suppliers, program planning for multi-state assistance delivery, or other activities that improve the
interactions between manufacturers.
