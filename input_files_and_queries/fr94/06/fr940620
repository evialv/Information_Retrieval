SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule revises the regulations governing inspection and certification for fresh fruits, vegetables and
other products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(other products are: raw nuts, Christmas trees and evergreens, flowers and flower bulbs, and onion sets) by adjusting
the fees charged for the inspection of these products at destination markets and by clarifying other charge-related
regulations. The fee increases are necessary to offset the costs of developing and maintaining U.S. grade standards
for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products and to recover the costs of providing Federal inspection service
for these products at destination markets as authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946. Regulations
regarding fees for inspection of small lots (fifty packages or less) are added to provide a fee commensurate with the
level of effort typically required to conduct such inspections. Finally, regulations regarding charges for waiting
time are added and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions governing the applicability of dock-side inspection fees are clarified.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule has been determined not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and has been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have a retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), the Administrator
of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule for the revision of the Regulations governing inspection,
certification and standards for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products will not impose substantial direct
economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small entities, and will not alter the market share
or competitive position of these entities relative to large businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations were last revised in November 1992. This final rule reflects fee increases needed to offset the cost
of developing and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables previously funded through an
appropriation and to recover the costs of Federal fruit and vegetable inspection service at destination markets
rendered in accordance with the AMA of 1946. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1994, Congress directed AMS to establish a user fee program,
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, to recover the cost of developing, reviewing, and maintaining agricultural commodity
standards that describe product quality attributes. This rule amends fees and charges applied to users at destination
markets to recover the portion of the cost for fresh fruit and vegetable standardization that is applicable to these
users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA authorizes voluntary official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of fresh fruits,
vegetables, and other products such as raw nuts, Christmas trees, and flowers. The AMA provides that reasonable fees
be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered.
The program seeks to maintain an unobligated balance that is at least equal to 4 months of operating expense. The unobligated
balance for the Federal inspection service at destination markets at the end of fiscal year 1993 was 1.1 months of operating
expense. Approximately $240,000 in increases are expected in the cost the service pays for General Services Administration
office rent and Federal Telecommunications Service, and a $120,000 increase is expected for the cost of implementing
a locality-based pay system in January 1994. The service is implementing cost-cutting actions during fiscal year
1994 that will save approximately $350,000 in destination market costs each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year
1995. These cost-cutting actions will offset most of the expected increases in service costs; however, further action
is necessary to meet all rising costs and for the program's unobligated balance to grow to the 4 month level necessary
to provide contingency funding. This final rule amends the schedule for fees and charges for services rendered to
the fresh fruit and vegetable industry at destination markets to reflect the costs currently associated with the
program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four written comments were received from field inspection personnel. Two of these comments noted the need to provide
guidance on whether product shipped in a bulk bin is to be considered a single package when determining fees under &sect;51.38.
AMS will issue inspection instructions that state the net weight of product in bulk bins is to be divided by the net weight
of the common package for that product to determine the number of packages represented by a bulk bin. The third comment
noted that the charge for additional lots reported on an inspection certificate fails to recover the full cost of sampling
product inspected in accordance with Florida citrus standards. Florida citrus standards specify a number of samples
to be examined for each reported lot that is higher than the number of samples typically used for other standards. AMS
believes that a separate charge for additional lots reported for products inspected in accordance with the Florida
citrus standards would be confusing and should not be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth comment suggested eliminating the proposed $264 flat rate for inspections of 5 or more products unloaded
from land or air transportation, and substituting carlot fees for the first four products, and a $37 fee for each additional
product. This suggestion would increase fees for quality and condition inspections another $6 to $33 beyond the increase
currently proposed. For this reason, AMS is not adopting this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth comment also suggested the implementation of a charge for additional lots reported on an inspection certificate
for product inspected at dock-side in place of the proposed fee increase in the dock-side package rates. The commenter
noted that requests from applicants for dock-side inspections vary significantly not only in the number of packages
but also in the number of lots to be separately sampled and reported on an inspection certificate. By implementing
a charge for additional lots when performing dock-side inspections, as AMS currently does for inspections of product
from land or air conveyances, the commenter believed that dock-side fees charged to each applicant would more accurately
reflect AMS's cost of performing the requested inspection. The total revenue to be generated from charges for additional
lots would be approximately equal to the total revenue that would have been generated from the proposed increase in
package rates. Because this suggestion allows AMS fees at dock-side to more equitably reflect the cost of providing
the requested service, and because the suggestion would not raise fees beyond the level initially proposed, this
suggestion has been adopted in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two written comments were received from the industry. Industry commenters, both wholesale fruit and vegetable receivers,
opposed the fee increase as they believe the current fee levels should be sufficient to fund the service. However,
AMS projects that, without a fee increase, the program will exhaust its unobligated balance and become insolvent
early in Fiscal Year 1996. One commenter further believes that the lack of a competing inspection service may cause
the program to operate inefficiently. While this inspection service is the only authorized inspection service under
the AMA, nonetheless, the service is not relying solely on fee increases to defray rising costs. Currently, the program
is phasing out a third of its permanent billing and collection staff and releasing office space in 11 cities to save
an estimated $250,000 annually. Moreover, the service is planning to reorganize its management structure to eliminate
one of three management layers to save users of destination market services over $100,000 annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the continuing need to maintain this AMS grading program on a financially sound basis, the Agency has decided
to proceed with the fee increase as set forth in the proposal, with one modification regarding dock-side fees in accordance
with a comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When product is inspected at dock-side, the number of different lots (i.e. varieties, sizes, brands) present in the
product, along with the number of total packages, determines the time required to sample and report inspection results.
Therefore, in lieu of increasing the package fees as had been proposed, AMS is implementing a $12 fee for each additional
lot reported on an inspection certificate for product inspected at dock-side. This is the same fee that is currently
charged for each additional lot reported on an inspection certificate for product unloaded from land or air transportation.
Revenue from the additional lot fee is expected to be equivalent to that of the previously proposed package fee increase.
By implementing the additional lot fee for dock-side inspections, charges for these inspections will more fairly
reflect AMS's cost of providing the requested service, so that inspections of products with few varieties, sizes,
or brands reported separately on the inspection certificate will be charged at a lower fee than inspections of products
with the same total number of packages but with comparatively more varieties, sizes, or brands reported separately
on the inspection certificate.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of
this action until 30 days after publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the fiscal year 1994 reserve balance of the program's trust fund is projected to be less than one month's operating
reserve which is well below the four-month level necessary to ensure the program's fiscal viability.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule revises the regulations under the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended, concerning the Tolerances
for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Analyzers. It incorporates by reference the AOAC International (formerly
known as the Association of Official Analytical Chemists) Method 992.23, Crude Protein in Cereal Grains and Oilseeds
Generic Combustion Method (1992), into the regulations. FGIS will use the Combustion method as the chemical reference
method for determining the protein content in both wheat and soybeans. This rule also eliminates the use of the Kjeldahl
method for official protein inspections and more clearly describes the application of tolerances to official NIRS
type instruments.

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. The United States Grain Standards Act provides in Section 87g that no State or subdivision
may require or impose any requirements or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain
under the Act. Otherwise, this final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.

David R. Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

), because most users of the official inspection and weighing services and those entities that perform these services
do not meet the requirements for small entities.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 9, 1993, FGIS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 42257), a proposed rule entitled ``Tolerances for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Analyzers''. At the
time the proposed revisions to the regulations were published the AOAC International (formerly known as the Association
of Official Analytical Chemists) had not yet completed official adoption of the Combustion method. Therefore, the
Combustion method was referred to as the FGIS Combustion method is the proposed revisions. Since the proposed rule
was published, the AOAC International has completed the approval process and officially published the method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the AOAC International published the Combustion method, an identifying method number was assigned. The Combustion
method is identified and referenced in the final rule as AOAC International, Method 992.23, Crude Protein in Cereal
Grains and Oilseeds Generic Combustion Method (1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS currently uses the Kjeldahl method as the primary reference method by which NIRS protein-measuring instruments
are calibrated. NIRS instruments are used to determine protein in wheat and soybeans in both domestic and export markets.
The final rule incorporates by reference the AOAC International Method 992.23, Crude Protein in Cereal Grains and
Oilseeds Generic Combustion Method (1992) into the regulations. FGIS will replace the Kjeldahl method with the Combustion
method as the chemical reference method for protein determinations. The Combustion method uses a nitrogen analyzer
consisting of a computer-controlled closed-system combustion process and a thermal conductivity detector. This
method has also been approved (September 1992) by the American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) for protein
determination in cereal grains. In addition, this method has been approved as a Recommended Practice (April 1993)
by the American Oil Chemists' Society (AOCS) for protein determination in oilseeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing from the Kjeldahl method to the Combustion method will provide many benefits to FGIS and other users. The
Combustion method does not use hazardous chemicals or produce the environmental pollutants associated with the
Kjeldahl method. Also, the shorter analysis time for the Combustion method allows a larger sample throughput, permitting
a more effective evaluation of the NIRS instrument calibrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS has extensively compared the protein results obtained using the Combustion method and the Kjeldahl method.
Statistical analysis of these data shows that each method is capable of providing equally precise and reproducible
protein results; however, the Combustion method has a general tendency to yield slightly higher results than the
FGIS Kjeldahl method. The results from the Combustion method should reflect the true protein content of U.S. wheat
and soybeans more accurately than the Kjeldahl reference method. The observed differences are approximately +0.03
percent protein for wheat and +0.3 percent protein for soybeans. The increase in the protein for wheat should have
a minimal impact on domestic and export wheat markets. The increase in protein for soybeans should have a minimal impact
on domestic and export soybean markets because trading price of soybeans is not routinely based on the protein content.
The maintenance tolerances for NIRS instruments are used to maintain consistent results among official protein
and oil determinations. All NIRS instruments are adjusted to give consistent results on the national Standard Reference
Samples (SRS). Values for the SRS are assigned using the FGIS national standard NIRS instruments. Further, the FGIS
national standard NIRS instruments are calibrated and routinely standardized to the FGIS chemical reference method.

Comment Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 30-day comment period, 14 comments were filed in response to the proposal. Comments were received from
two grain industry associations. The associations stated that they did not oppose the proposal and that they generally
supported the adoption of the Combustion method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received from a foreign oilseed processor association. The association supported the change; however,
it requested that FGIS continue to use both the Kjeldahl method and the Combustion method as references for the NIRS
instruments. FGIS after considering this comment, has determined that maintaining two reference methods is counterproductive
for protein uniformity and efficient use of space and staff. Consequently FGIS must maintain only one reference method
for protein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One oilseeds processor association stated that it generally supported the adoption of the Combustion method. The
association was concerned about differences among industry Kjeldahl labs and FGIS and other labs using the Combustion
method. FGIS has recognized the existence of a positive bias between methods and reported that in the proposed rule.
FGIS contends that this small increase in the protein will have a minimal impact on domestic and export soybean markets
because the trading prices of soybeans are not routinely based on the protein content and the small bias is insignificant
in proportion to the total average protein content of soybeans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One university professor commented in support of the proposed change; however, he requested a delay in implementing
the change to allow for an industry discussion to promote uniformity throughout the soybean industry. FGIS believes
that such a delay is unwarranted because the Combustion method is currently being used in several countries around
the world by industry laboratories, commercial and private laboratories, and government laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two foreign milling companies expressed interest in the Combustion method, but they did not have enough information
to comment on the proposed changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 737&hyph;300 series
airplanes, that requires replacement of the forward and aft hinge shims and the lower hinge fairings of the main cargo
door with new shims and fairings. This amendment is prompted by reports of a slight separation between the end hinge
shims and the cargo door; this separation can cause bending loads on the fasteners. The actions specified by this AD
are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the hinge fasteners, loss of structural integrity of the cargo door hinge,
possible loss of the cargo door, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing 737&hyph;300 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64198). That action proposed to require replacement of the forward and aft hinge shims and
the lower hinge fairings of the main cargo door with new shims and fairings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters support the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter considers there is no justification for issuing the proposed rule, since most of the affected airplanes
have already been modified in accordance with the proposed requirements. The FAA does not concur. Although the commenter
has provided the FAA with data indicating that the proposed modification has been accomplished on all airplanes currently
on the U.S. Register, this data did not provide positive indication, verified by FAA personnel, that the modification
had been accomplished on airplanes not currently on the U.S. Register. Should one of these affected airplanes be imported
to the U.S. in the future, this AD is necessary in order to ensure that the required actions are accomplished on the airplane
prior to it being placed on the U.S. Register. Further, as is indicated in the final rule, operators are given ``credit''
for previously accomplishing the requirements of the rule; therefore, no further action is required on the part of
the operators in these cases. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter contends that there is no justification for the proposed AD, since the Supplemental Type Certificate
(STC) holder (Pemco) has not indicated that the referenced Pemco service bulletin concerns an airworthiness problem.
The commenter states that Pemco has portrayed the service bulletin as addressing only a reliability problem. The
FAA does not concur. In developing this AD action, the FAA reviewed the relevant data which indicated that this STC
door design allows slight separation between the end hinge shims and the cargo door during pressurization cycles;
such separation can cause increased bending loads on the door hinge fasteners. The FAA determined that this situation
constitutes an unsafe condition since, if not corrected, it could lead to fatigue failure of the hinge fasteners,
loss of structural integrity of the cargo door hinge, possible loss of the cargo door, and subsequent rapid decompression
of the airplane. Regardless of whether or not the wording in the service bulletin describes the procedures specified
within it as addressing an airworthiness problem, the FAA finds that accomplishment of those procedures will serve
to eliminate the identified unsafe condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that the wording that identifies the location of the affected cargo door be clarified. The
commenter points out that the notice identified this door as the ``main cargo door;'' however, a more correct identification
would be ``main deck cargo door.'' The FAA concurs and has changed the pertinent wording in the final rule accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

There are approximately 11 Model 737&hyph;300 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 280 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided by Pemco Aeroplex at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $30,800, or $15,400 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that all affected U.S.-registered airplanes have been modified previously
in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, there is no cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series
airplanes, that currently requires repetitive inspections, tests, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust
reverser system and of selected engine wiring. This amendment adds a requirement for installation of a terminating
modification, repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair of any discrepancy found. This amendment
is prompted by the identification of a modification that ensures that the level of safety inherent in the original
type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
Two commenters request that specific references to page numbers and revision dates of the Boeing 767 Airplane Maintenance
Manual (AMM), which are specified in paragraph (f) of the proposal, be removed from the proposed rule. Boeing recommends
that the proposed AD specify only the ATA Chapter-Section-Subject, pageblock title, and task title. Boeing explains
that the AMM's are customized for each operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's fleet. Therefore,
the number of pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different equipment configurations
documented in an operator's AMM. Boeing also indicates that AMM procedures are revised periodically for non-technical
reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to accommodate an upgrade of the
publishing system that is currently under way, which, in addition to repagination, will necessitate the issuance
of revised AMM pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
Boeing also requests that a reference to a specific Temporary Revision (TR) number, which is specified in ``NOTE 4''
under paragraph (c) of the proposal, be eliminated from the proposed rule. Boeing explains that because of the customization
of AMM's for each operator, multiple TR's may be issued to address a technical concern. While changes to the procedure
can be identical for all operators, the page layout of each operator's AMM can require a unique TR to allow the operator
to correctly integrate the TR into the AMM. Since each unique TR has a different number, the specific TR referenced
in the proposal only applies to the AMM's for three operators of a possible 18 operators. Additionally, TR's are removed
from an operator's AMM and destroyed when the data is incorporated in a subsequent regular revision. The procedural
changes in the TR cited in the proposal were incorporated into the AMM in November 1992, and instructions were provided
in an AMM transmittal letter to remove the TR. Therefore, it is probable that operators no longer have the TR that was
cited in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
Boeing concludes that the net effect of specifying AMM page numbers, AMM revision dates, and TR's in the AD would be
that operators may be unable to use the procedure contained in the AMM to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each
operator would be required to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA approval of an alternative
method of compliance with the AD that would allow the use of the current version of the AMM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the commenters, the FAA finds that specific reference
to the TR cited in ``NOTE 4'' under paragraph (c) of the proposal should not be specified in the final rule. Accordingly,
``NOTE 4'' has been removed from the final rule. Additionally, the FAA's objective in proposing periodic operational
checks of the sync-lock device, as specified in paragraph (f) of this AD, is to ensure the integrity of the locking function.
However, since the issuance of the proposal and receipt of Boeing's comments to the proposal, Boeing has submitted
to the FAA separate procedures for accomplishment of the operational checks of the sync-lock integrity. Therefore,
these procedures have been defined in paragraph (f) of the final rule, and the AMM references specified previously
in paragraph (f) of the proposal have been removed from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, states that, while ATA members are not opposed
to accomplishing the proposed checks as part of their maintenance programs, these members are opposed to accomplishing
the checks as part of the requirements of an AD. The commenters believe that the requirement for operational checks
is equivalent to issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement for operational checks in the
AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the checks should be provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative
is justified because no data exist to show that repetitive checks of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled adequately
through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing
the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational
check of the sync-lock. The initial check would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after modification.
The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators
choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) 91.417 or 121.380. The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI)
for operators electing this alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes the concerns of the commenter regarding the requirement for periodic operational checks of the
sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA finds that the operational checks are necessary in order
to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required
by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure
adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives
of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives
from other organizations, such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from
the recommendations of the task force.

The FAA acknowledges that the operational checks specified in this AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled
maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock
to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational checks is necessary
in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe condition. This determination
is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service
experience. In addition, service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock
that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in activation of the
sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested alternative to accomplishment of the operational checks would
permit each operator to determine whether and how often these checks should be conducted. In light of the severity
of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate
at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish checks of the integrity of the sync-lock
installation in a common manner and at common intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also finds that addressing operational checks of the sync-lock integrity in a recommended action, such as
an MRB report, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust reverser system. However, the
FAA recognizes that an operational check interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service, which will be recommended by Boeing
for inclusion in the next revision to the MRB report, corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected
operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours
time-in-service for accomplishment of repetitive operational checks. In light of the safety implications of the
unsafe condition addressed and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational checks of the fleet during
regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be readily available,
the FAA finds that accomplishment of the checks at intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable
level of safety. Paragraph (f) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0062,
Revision 3, dated February 24, 1994. This revised service bulletin is essentially identical to the previous revision
(which was cited in the notice), but contains certain minor editorial changes. The FAA has revised the final rule to
include this revised service bulletin as an additional source of appropriate service information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 88 Model 767 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 26 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 480 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required modification, and 1 work hour to accomplish the required operational checks, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $687,830, or $26,455 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 757 series airplanes,
that requires tests of the thrust reverser system, and repair, if necessary; installation of a modification that
terminates those tests; and repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair, if necessary. This
amendment is prompted by results of a safety review, which revealed that in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser
could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 757 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47225). That action proposed to require tests of the thrust reverser system, and repair,
if necessary; installation of a modification that would terminate those tests; and repetitive operational checks
of that installation, and repair, if necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters question the requirement for periodic operational checks of the sync-lock following its installation,
as specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, states that, while ATA members are not
opposed to accomplishing the proposed checks as part of their maintenance programs, these members are opposed to
accomplishing the checks as part of the requirements of an AD. The commenters believe that the requirement for operational
checks is equivalent to issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement for operational checks in the
AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the checks should be provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative
is justified because no data exist to show that repetitive checks of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled adequately
through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing
the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational
check of the sync-lock. The initial check would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after modification.
The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators
choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) 91.417 or 121.380. The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI)
for operators electing this alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One commenter, Boeing, requests that the proposed requirement for operational checks be removed from the AD until
the FAA reviews the ``more comprehensive'' scheduled maintenance recommendations developed by the Model 757/767
Thrust Reverser Working Group, which will be recommended in the next revision to the Maintenance Review Board (MRB)
report. Boeing believes that adoption of the maintenance recommendations contained in that forthcoming revision
will ensure that an adequate level of safety (with regard to the sync-lock installation) will be maintained by all
operators of Model 757 series airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. One commenter states that these checks should not be required because failures of the sync-lock would not be hidden.
The commenter states that normal operation of the thrust reverser will indicate if the sync-lock system is active,
and whenever the sync-lock system is not available, either the unlock indicator on the external surface of the engine
cowling will indicate this condition or the thrust reverser will not deploy on request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. One commenter asks why operational checks would be required at more frequent intervals following installation
of an additional safety feature than prior to its installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes the concerns of these commenters regarding the requirement for periodic operational checks of
the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA finds that the operational checks are necessary in order
to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required
by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure
adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives
of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives
from other organizations, such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from
the recommendations of the task force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges that the operational checks specified in this AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled
maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock
to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational checks is necessary
in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe condition. This determination
is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service
experience. In addition, service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock
that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in activation of the
sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested alternative to accomplishment of the operational checks would
permit each operator to determine whether and how often these checks should be conducted. In light of the severity
of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate
at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish checks of the integrity of the sync-lock
installation in a common manner and at common intervals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also finds that addressing operational checks of the sync-lock integrity in a recommended action, such as
an MRB report, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust reverser system. However, the
FAA recognizes that an operational check interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service, which will be recommended by Boeing
for inclusion in the next revision to the MRB report, corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected
operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours
time-in-service for accomplishment of repetitive operational checks. In light of the safety implications of the
unsafe condition addressed and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational checks of the fleet during
regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be readily available,
the FAA finds that accomplishment of the checks at intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable
level of safety. Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing requests that specific references to page numbers and revision dates of the Boeing 757 Airplane Maintenance
Manual (AMM) be eliminated from paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the AD. Boeing recommends that the
proposed AD specify only the ATA Chapter-Section-Subject pageblock title and task title in these paragraphs. A second
commenter states that the referenced pages could not be found in its latest copy of the AMM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing explains that the AMM's are customized for each operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's
fleet. Therefore, the number of pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different equipment
configurations documented in an operator's AMM. Boeing also indicates that AMM procedures are revised periodically
for non-technical reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to accommodate
an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in addition to repagination, will necessitate
the issuance of revised AMM pages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing states that the effect of specifying AMM page numbers and revision dates in the AD is that operators may be unable
to use the procedure contained in the AMM to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator would be required
to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance
with the AD that would allow the use of the current version of the AMM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the commenter, the FAA finds that specific AMM
page numbers and dates should not be specified in the final rule. Therefore, such references have been removed from
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final rule. However, for those paragraphs, the FAA does not agree that copies of
the specific procedures should be included in the final rule. Therefore, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final
rule have been revised to cite only the appropriate section and task title specified in the AMM for accomplishment
of the tests required by those paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's objective in proposing periodic operational checks of the sync-lock device, as specified in paragraph
(c) of this AD, is to ensure the integrity of the locking function. However, subsequent to the issuance of the proposal
and the receipt of Boeing's comments to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for accomplishment
of the operational check of the sync-lock integrity. These procedures have been defined in paragraph (c) of the final
rule; therefore, the AMM references specified in paragraph (c) of the NPRM have been removed from the final rule. Additionally,
the procedures for the operational checks are accomplished independently of the other thrust reverser system tests
specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal. Accordingly, the FAA has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule to require
periodic accomplishment of operational checks of the sync-lock integrity only, and has removed the requirement
for accomplishment of other tests specified in that paragraph of the proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Boeing has issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032,
dated May 12, 1994. The service bulletin revision moves general work instruction Step B from Work Package 2 to Step
U in Work Package 8. In Revision 1 of the service bulletin, Step B of Work Package 2 specified procedures for removal
of the ground to the EICAS for the REV ISLN VAL message; however, the ground should not be removed as part of Work Package
2. Rather, the ground should be removed as part of Work Package 8 in order to avoid loss of the REV ISLN VAL message on EICAS.
Revision 2 of the service bulletin correctly describes procedures for removal of the ground as part of Work Package
8. Revision 2 of the service bulletin also describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for installation of an additional bracket on the P36 disconnect bracket and to make a cutout on the P37 disconnect
bracket on certain airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved this latest revision to the service bulletin and has revised the final rule to reflect
it as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA finds that citing this latest revision to the service
bulletin will impose no additional burden on any operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that Revision 2 of Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627 and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional sources of service information for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation.
However, the Boeing service bulletin does not specify the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service
bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 1'' to paragraph (b) of this AD to specify that the intent of that paragraph
is that the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins that are to be used in conjunction with
Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613,
dated December 3, 1992, or Revision 1, dated March 5, 1993, or Revision 2, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service
Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627, dated December 3, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, since the issuance of the proposed rule, Rolls-Royce has issued Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822,
dated October 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for installation of a revised thrust reverser
sync-lock. The FAA has determined that accomplishment of the actions described in this service bulletin, in conjunction
with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 [which was cited in paragraph (b) of the proposal as the appropriate
source of service information for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature], constitutes
an acceptable alternative to the sync-lock installation specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this information, paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to include paragraph (b)(1), which contains
the requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature that was specified in the
proposed rule, and paragraph (b)(2), which provides for installation of a revised thrust reverser sync-lock as an
acceptable alternative to paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. Accomplishment of the revised installation specified in
paragraph (b)(2) requires no additional work hours beyond the 506 work hours specified in the economic impact information,
below, for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it should be noted that Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 references Rolls-Royce
Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 as an additional source of service information for airplanes equipped
with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535E4/E4B engines. Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 references
Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627 as an additional source of service information. However,
the appropriate revision levels for these service bulletins are not specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032
or in any of the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 2'' to paragraph (b) of the final
rule to specify that the appropriate revision levels to be used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin
RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613, Revision
2, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627, dated December 3, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 250 Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 95 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the restow and integrity tests required by this AD,
that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish those tests, and that the average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators to accomplish each operational
test is estimated to be $5,225, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 95 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish either modification specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD. It will take approximately
506 work hours per airplane to accomplish either of those modifications, and the average labor rate is $55 per work
hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators to accomplish the modification is estimated to be $2,643,850, or $27,830 per
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also estimates that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the periodic operational
tests of the sync-lock installation required by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to
accomplish each test, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators to accomplish each operational test is estimated to be $6,215, or $55 per airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,655,290. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the modification will require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 5-year
compliance time specified in paragraph (b) of this AD should allow ample time for the sync-lock installation to be
accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing
the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F27 series airplanes,
that requires replacement of certain bolts that are currently installed in various flight critical components of
the airplane. This amendment is prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal; these incidents
have jeopardized the airworthiness of the affected airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
reduced structural integrity of various flight critical components of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Fokker F27 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5968). That action proposed to require replacement of AN bolts that are currently installed
in various flight critical components of the airplane with NAS bolts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 39 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 250
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $690 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $563,160, or $14,440 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the modification requires a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 3-year
compliance time specified in paragraph (a) of this AD should allow ample time for the replacement of AN bolts to be accomplished
coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs
associated with special airplane scheduling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at
the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that requires installation of new fairlead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies and P-clips; inspection to detect damage of the wiring harness at the wing rear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spars; repair or replacement of any damaged wiring harness with a new wiring harness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly; and verification of the position of the currently installed P-clips, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repositioning, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report of abrasion of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical power cable in the wiring harness at the wing rear spar. The actions specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD are intended to prevent abrasion of electrical power cables in the wiring harnesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the wing rear spars, which could lead to a dormant failure of emergency fuel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydraulic shutoff services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6933). That action proposed to require installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of new fairlead assemblies and P-clips; inspection to detect damage of the wiring harness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the wing rear spars; repair or replacement of any damaged wiring harness with a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wiring harness assembly; and verification of the position of the currently installed P-clips, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and repositioning, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The FAA estimates that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,320, or $110 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 On May 11, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration published a final rule amending the Aurora, Buckley ANG Base
Airport, CO, Class D airspace designation. It incorporated information concerning the control tower's hours of
operation at the Buckley ANG Base, CO. The airspace designation was predicated on the new Denver International Airport
airspace reconfiguration. Given the indefinite delay for opening the new Denver International Airport, the FAA
is withdrawing this rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 11, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the Aurora, Buckley ANG Base Class D airspace to incorporate
``part-time'' information into the rule (59 FR 24344; May 11, 1994). The information would provide pilots with notice
that the Class D airspace would not be effective during certain periods of the day. The Class D airspace amendment was
to be established after the new Denver International Airport was commissioned. The official opening of the airport
has been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the FAA is withdrawing
this Class D amendment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations to require submission of a Certificate of Eligibility in connection
with the entry of non-originating textile and apparel goods from Canada or Mexico for which preferential tariff treatment
is claimed under the tariff preference level provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Failure
to submit the required Certificate of Eligibility will result in a denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.
This regulatory action is intended to ensure that the NAFTA implementing regulations reflect procedures agreed
to by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 17, 1992, the United States, Canada and Mexico entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
one of the principal purposes of which is to eliminate tariff and other barriers to trade in, and facilitate the cross-border
movement of, goods and services between the territories of the countries. The provisions of the NAFTA were adopted
by the United States with the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``Act''),
Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057. On December 30, 1993, Customs published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 69460) T.D. 94&hyph;1 setting forth interim amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement the Customs-related
aspects of the NAFTA. Those interim regulations took effect on January 1, 1994, to coincide with the entry into force
of the NAFTA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The centerpiece of the NAFTA involves the granting of preferential tariff (duty-free or reduced-duty) treatment
on goods imported into a NAFTA country from another NAFTA country. As a general rule, such preferential tariff treatment
may only be accorded to goods that satisfy the rules of origin standards set forth in Chapter Four of the NAFTA; such
goods are referred to as ``originating'' goods for NAFTA purposes. The NAFTA Chapter Four rules of origin are set forth
in section 202 of the Act which is codified at 19 U.S.C. 3332. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Chapter Three of the NAFTA, Appendix 6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B provides for an exception to the general rule regarding
the granting of NAFTA preferential tariff treatment only to originating goods. This exception concerns specified
textile and apparel goods which, because of the origin of the materials used to produce the goods in a NAFTA country
and/or the nature of the processing used to produce the goods in a NAFTA country, do not meet the Chapter Four rules of
origin standards and thus do not qualify as originating goods under the NAFTA. For such non-originating goods, Appendix
6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B provides that they may nevertheless be granted preferential tariff treatment (that is,
the duty-free or reduced-duty treatment that would be accorded to the same type of good when it qualifies as an originating
good) up to specified annual quantitative ``tariff preference levels'' (TPLs). Once a TPL applicable to a NAFTA country's
exports to another NAFTA country has been reached, any further exports of goods of that TPL category to the same NAFTA
country during that year may not be accorded NAFTA preferential tariff treatment but rather will be subject to duty
at the most-favored-nation rate. The TPL quantitative limits are set forth by category in Schedules 6.B.1. through
6.B.3. of Annex 300&hyph;B with reference to imports into each NAFTA country from each of the other NAFTA countries.
For U.S. import purposes, the TPL provisions of Appendix 6.B. and Schedules 6.B.1. through 6.B.3. are also set forth
in Additional U.S. Notes 3 through 6 to Section XI, HTSUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic procedures for filing a claim for NAFTA preferential tariff treatment, set forth in &sect;181.21 of the
NAFTA implementing regulations (19 CFR 181.21), are generally applicable in the case of goods for which preferential
tariff treatment is sought under the TPL provisions described above. However, there is one principal exception to
those procedures as regards goods to which Appendix 6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B applies: as stated in paragraph (a) of
that section, there is no requirement that the written declaration (which constitutes the claim for preferential
tariff treatment) be based on a Certificate of Origin in the possession of the importer. This exception is necessary
because a NAFTA Certificate of Origin has reference only to originating goods (that is, goods which comply with the
Chapter Four rules of origin standards) and thus does not cover TPL goods which are, by definition, not originating
goods. In this regard, &sect;181.21(a) also contains a cross-reference to &sect;12.132 (19 CFR 12.132) which was
added by T.D. 94&hyph;1 to clarify the application of the already-existing &sect;12.130(f) (19 CFR 12.130(f)) country
of origin declaration requirements in the context of textile and apparel goods which are subject to the provisions
of Annex 300&hyph;B of the NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the publication of T.D. 94&hyph;1 and the entry into force of the NAFTA, representatives of the United States,
Canada and Mexico continued to have discussions regarding whether additional requirements or procedures should
be adopted for purposes of administering the provisions of Annex 300&hyph;B of the NAFTA. As a result of those discussions,
Canada and Mexico have decided on, and implemented, use of a Certificate of Eligibility as the means for monitoring
and identifying export shipments eligible for preferential tariff treatment pursuant to the TPL provisions of Appendix
6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B of the NAFTA. The Certificate of Eligibility, signed by an authorized official of the Canadian
or Mexican government, is issued to the Canadian or Mexican exporter for transmittal to the importer of the goods who
then would be able to make a claim for preferential tariff treatment based on the Certificate of Eligibility. The United
States, Canada and Mexico have agreed that presentation of a properly completed and executed Certificate of Eligibility
for Canadian and Mexican exports is a prerequisite to the granting of a claim for preferential tariff treatment under
the TPL provisions, and failure to present such a Certificate of Eligibility will result in assessment of duty at the
most-favored-nation (that is, non-NAFTA) rate. No action has been taken by the United States to institute use of a
Certificate of Eligibility for U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the adoption of the above procedures regarding use of the Certificate of Eligibility for Canadian and Mexican
exports, Customs has been granting claims for preferential tariff treatment on TPL goods imported from Canada or
Mexico only if a properly completed and executed Certificate of Eligibility pertaining to the goods is presented
to Customs when the claim is made. In order to ensure that the NAFTA implementing regulations reflect the trilaterally-agreed
procedures and provide appropriate guidance to the public regarding U.S. import requirements, this document amends
&sect;12.132 on an interim basis to require submission of a Canadian or Mexican Certificate of Eligibility in connection
with a claim for preferential tariff treatment on goods covered by the NAFTA TPL provisions. Customs further believes
that this interim amendment should take effect immediately to ensure the greatest procedural benefit to the public,
and it is noted in this regard that the post-importation refund procedure under the NAFTA applies only to ``originating''
goods and thus is not an available administrative remedy in a TPL context for a failure to make a claim at the time of importation
(see Article 502(3) of the NAFTA, 19 U.S.C. 1520(d) as added by section 206 of the Act, and Subpart D of Part 181 of the
NAFTA implementing regulations set forth in T.D. 94&hyph;1).

Before adopting this interim regulation as a final rule, consideration will be given to any written comments timely
submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), &sect;1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and &sect;103.11(b),
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a), public notice is inapplicable to this interim regulation because it
is within the foreign affairs function of the United States. A failure to have this regulation in place at the earliest
practicable date would provoke undesirable international consequences. In addition, because this regulation
sets forth procedures which the public needs to know in order to claim the benefit of a tariff preference under the NAFTA,
it is determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that notice and public procedures are impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, for the above reasons, it is determined that good cause exists under
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (d)(3) for dispensing with a delayed effective date.

This interim rule does not impose any information collection requirements. Instead, it would eliminate the existing
requirement for HAs and HA contractors to submit form HUD&hyph;2530, Previous Participation Certificate, to HUD.
As a result of this interim rule, there would be a reduction in the information burden on HUD program participants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Subpart H of 24 CFR part 200 of the HUD regulations makes principals participating in projects financed
pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 subject to HUD approval under the previous participation and review
requirements set forth in that Subpart. Principals include ``an individual, joint venture, partnership, corporation,
trust, nonprofit association, or any other public or private entity proposing to participate, or participating,
in a project as sponsor, owner, prime contractor, Turnkey Developer, management agent, nursing home administrator
or operator, packager, or consultant; and architects and attorneys who have any interest in the project other than
an arms-length fee arrangement for professional services.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Subpart H all principals are requested to sign personally a certificate setting forth their record of previous
participation in HUD programs. These certifications are subject to review and either approval or disapproval by
the Department. An approval is required as a precondition to participation by the principal in a specific project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs frequently cite the previous participation approval requirement as an obstacle to their timely obligation of
funds. In reviewing the matter, the Department has found that approximately 78,000 principals were entered into
HUD's previous participation automated system during the last year. This figure includes principals from all programs
administered by the Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The
automated system has approved over 73,500 principals while approximately 4,500 principals were referred to Headquarters
for further review. About 1,500 of the referrals (less than 2 percent) involved principals in the public/Indian housing
programs. Of the 1,500 public/Indian housing principals, the majority were found to be approvable. Only a limited
number were disapproved, and most of the disapprovals were based on existing debarments or suspensions. It should
also be noted that HAs already have the authority to disqualify contractors who are on the General Services Administration
Debarred and Suspended List.

This Departmental analysis of the previous participation process raises serious questions regarding the benefits
derived vs. the delays caused in program implementation. Also taken into account in the analysis was the fact that
the Department's procurement regulations, at 24 CFR 85.36, require State and local grantees, including HAs, to award
contracts only to contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of their
contract. In assessing their ability to perform, consideration should be given by grantees to such matters as contractor
integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance and financial and technical resources. It
was also noted that, in other similar State, local, or Indian grant programs administered by the Department, such
as the Community Development Block Grant program, grantees are not subject, in addition to the procurement procedures
set forth at 24 CFR part 85, to a second previous participation and compliance review by HUD. Instead, the grantees
are given the responsibility to make their own determinations of contractor responsibility and are permitted to
execute contracts without obtaining prior HUD approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the very low number of disapprovals of public/Indian housing principals compared to the relatively high dollar
value of the program (approximately $3 billion annually) and the urgent need to streamline HUD procedures, the Department
has concluded that the risk to the Government of eliminating the previous participation approval for HAs is extremely
limited. Accordingly, we are amending the existing regulations to remove public and Indian housing developments
financed under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 from the Previous Participation and Compliance Requirements set forth
in 24 CFR part 200, Subpart H. HAs will still be expected to determine, pursuant to 24 CFR 85.36, if a contractor is responsible,
based on its own records, the GSA Debarred and Suspended list, the HUD Limited Denial of Participation List, and any
other information available to the HA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the technical nature of this interim rule, the Department has determined that a full notice and public comment
procedure under 24 CFR part 10 of the United States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as an
interim rule with public comment requested. The interim rule relieves a regulatory restriction that adversely affects
and has proved to be an undue burden on the public housing community. Further, the interim rule supports several of
the Department's key strategies for improving the way the Department's programs operate, including deregulating
programs to the extent feasible, focusing on risk management and taking actions to speed the expenditure of funds.
For these reasons, it is desirable to make the interim rule effective as soon as possible.

IV. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject matter of this interim rule is categorically excluded from HUD's environmental clearance procedures
under 24 CFR 50.20(k). The interim rule relates to administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a
development decision but only to the preparation of reports and HUD management activities.

B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the provisions of this interim rule do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order.
The interim rule does not, in any substantive manner, change existing relationships between the Federal government
and State and local authorities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim rule
before publication and, by approving it, certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on small entities.
This interim rule only directly affects PHAs and IHAs which are State and local governmental entities. The interim
rule should prove beneficial to PHAs and IHAs and should have no negative impact upon their contractors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the provisions
of this interim rule do not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general
well-being within the meaning of the Order.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations under 31 CFR part 10 governing the practice of individuals before the IRS.
These regulations affect individuals who are eligible to practice before the IRS. These regulations establish tax
return preparation standards and prescribe the circumstances under which a practitioner may be disciplined for
violating those standards, limit the use of contingent fees for preparing tax returns, clarify that certain of the
existing restrictions governing limited practice before the IRS apply to all individuals who are eligible to engage
in limited practice before the IRS, establish expedited proceedings to suspend individuals from practice before
the IRS in cases in which certain determinations have been made by independent bodies, and permit attorneys and certified
public accountants in good standing to obtain or retain enrolled agent status.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 8, 1992, the Department of the Treasury published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed amendments to the regulations governing practice before the IRS (57 FR 46356). The regulations are in subtitle
A, part 10, of title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations and have been reprinted as Treasury Department Circular No.
230 (Circular 230). A public hearing was held on December 16, 1992. A number of comments were received in response to
the proposed amendments. After careful consideration of the comments received, the regulations are adopted as revised
by this Treasury decision.

Explanation of Changes

I. Return Preparation Standards and Related Disciplinary Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Standards of Conduct
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations included new return preparation standards for attorneys, certified public accountants,
enrolled agents and enrolled actuaries (practitioners). These standards would modify Circular 230 to reflect more
closely the standards for return preparers under section 6694 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) and professional
guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, a practitioner may not sign a return as a preparer if the practitioner determines
that the return contains a position that does not have a realistic possibility of being sustained on its merits (the
realistic possibility standard), unless the position is not frivolous and is adequately disclosed to the IRS. In
addition, a practitioner may not advise a client to take a position on a return, or prepare the portion of a return on
which a position is taken, unless the practitioner determines that the position satisfies the realistic possibility
standard or the position is not frivolous and the practitioner advises the client to adequately disclose the position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator suggested deleting the language in the first sentence of &sect;10.34(a)(1) of the proposed regulations,
which prohibited a practitioner from signing a return without disclosure if the practitioner determined that the
return contained a position that did not satisfy the realistic possibility standard. The commentator asserted that
the practitioner should not be subject to discipline under Circular 230 if the return position resulted from reasonable
reliance on another preparer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury does not believe it is appropriate to alter the standard of conduct in &sect;10.34(a), which generally conforms
to the rules of section 6694. In addition, the commentator's concern is addressed by the standard of discipline of
&sect;10.34(b). Under this standard, only violations of &sect;10.34 that are willful, reckless, or grossly incompetent
will be subject to discipline. See Standard of Discipline, below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentator stated that a signing preparer should only be required to advise disclosure of (rather than actually
disclose) a return position that did not satisfy the realistic possibility standard. This commentator added that
Circular 230 should not distinguish between the not frivolous and realistic possibility standards because, in the
commentator's view, they are identical.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To promote consistency in disclosure standards, the Circular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
230 disclosure rules are patterned after the section 6694 rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, a signing preparer must actually disclose (rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than merely advise disclosure of) nonfrivolous return positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that do not satisfy the realistic possibility standard. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury believes the realistic possibility standard is distinct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the not frivolous standard, these amendments to Circular 230 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also distinguish between these two standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the OBRA '93) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made certain changes to the accuracy-related penalty in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6662 of the Code. The OBRA '93 raised the disclosure standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of the penalties for disregarding rules or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations or a substantial understatement of income tax from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``not frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis''. Also, the OBRA '93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS published temporary regulations &sect;1.6662&hyph;7T in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to implement these changes. See 59 FR 12547 (March 17, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994) and 59 FR 14749 (March 30, 1994). These changes narrow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities to avoid an accuracy-related penalty by disclosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a return position. In view of these changes, these final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations require non-signing practitioners to advise their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clients of any opportunity to avoid such a penalty by disclosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a position (rather than to disclose the position). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;10.34(a)(2) of the proposed regulations, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practitioner who advises a client on a position to be taken on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return, or who signs or prepares a return, must inform the client 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the penalties reasonably likely to apply to the client with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the position. One commentator contended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a practitioner apprise its client of penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably likely to apply intrudes on the practitioner-client 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship and should be deleted. Another commentator stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirement was too lenient and should be strengthened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by requiring practitioners to give their clients written notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of penalties reasonably likely to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury believes that informing clients of penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably likely to apply with respect to return positions is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important component of a practitioner's duty to his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
client. Accordingly, these final regulations retain this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. The final regulations, however, do not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practitioners to give the penalty advice in writing. Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that preserving flexibility as to the form in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practitioners advise their clients promotes client understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the advice and discourages the use of possibly confusing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boilerplate language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, a position satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realistic possibility standard if a reasonable and well-informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis by a person knowledgeable in the tax law would lead such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a person to conclude that the position has approximately a one in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three, or greater, likelihood of being sustained on its merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commentators stated that the one-in-three formulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the realistic possibility standard should not be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of Circular 230. A common criticism was that the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is inherently difficult to administer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The one-in-three test has been adopted for preparers under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6694. Adopting a different formulation of the realistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility standard in Circular 230 would lead to unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion. In addition, quantification of the realistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility standard helps to prevent its erosion. For these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, the suggestion of some commentators to eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-in-three test was not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining whether the realistic possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard is satisfied, the proposed regulations provide that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities that may be taken into account under 26 CFR 1.6662&hyph;4(d)(3)(iii) for purposes of the substantial
understatement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty also may be taken into account for purposes of Circular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
230. Some commentators suggested expanding the permissible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities to include well-reasoned treatises, articles in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized professional tax publications, and other reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tools commonly used by practitioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury believes that the determination of whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realistic possibility standard is satisfied for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circular 230 (as well as section 6694) should be grounded in laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted by politically authorized decisionmakers, not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretations of those laws in secondary source materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the suggestion was not adopted. Even though secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources are not authorities for Circular 230 purposes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practitioners may rely in preparing returns on applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities underlying the conclusions in those sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Standard of Discipline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed standard of discipline, only violations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;10.34 that are willful, reckless, or a result of gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompetence will subject a practitioner to suspension or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbarment from practice before the IRS. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations further provide that a pattern of conduct is a factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will be taken into account in determining whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practitioner acted recklessly or with gross incompetence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commentator suggested that the standard of discipline for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;10.34 be amended to provide that only a pattern of conduct will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject a practitioner to discipline. This suggestion would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit practitioners to violate the new return preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of Circular 230 at least once without being subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discipline by the Director of Practice. Treasury does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe it is appropriate for Circular 230 to countenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper conduct, or to establish a more lenient standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discipline in the return preparation context than in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circular 230 contexts not requiring a pattern of conduct to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose discipline. Accordingly, this suggestion was not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator recommended that a general reasonable cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and good faith exception be expressly incorporated into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of discipline for &sect;10.34 of Circular 230. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentators also asked for a more limited reasonable cause and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good faith exception for reasonable reliance on the advice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another practitioner. The existing standard of discipline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates the need for an express reasonable cause and good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faith exception in that willful, reckless, or grossly incompetent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations of Circular 230 are inconsistent with reasonable cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and good faith. Therefore, these suggestions were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Contingent Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations ban contingent fees for preparing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return except in the case of certain claims for refund. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations, a practitioner may charge a contingent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee for preparing a claim for refund if the practitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably anticipates, at the time the claim is filed, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim will be denied by the IRS and subsequently litigated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
client. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments were received concerning the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule on contingent fees. Some commentators expressed concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the administrability of the portion of the rule involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims for refund. These commentators noted that it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to anticipate whether the IRS will deny a claim and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a client will choose to litigate the claim if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denied. They also asserted that a claim's prospects for being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denied should be evaluated at the time of the fee arrangement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than at the time the claim is filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commentators questioned the need for additional rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Circular 230 regulating fees at all. These commentators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the preparer and accuracy-related penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide adequate safeguards against overly-aggressive positions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed rule is broader than necessary to counter any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of contingent fee arrangements to exploit the ``audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lottery,'' and that the proposed rule could interfere with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable commercial relationships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury continues to believe that a rule restricting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contingent fees for preparing tax returns supports voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the tax laws by discouraging return positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that exploit the audit selection process. In response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received, the proposed contingent fee rule has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified in the final regulations to permit contingent fees for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims for refund (other than claims for refund made on original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returns) or for amended returns if the practitioner reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipates, at the time the fee arrangement is entered into, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the return will receive substantive review by the IRS. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination will be made on a case-by-case basis. Like the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, the final rule bans contingent fees for preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original returns.

III. Restrictions on Individuals Engaging in Limited Practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generally required that all nonpractitioners who engage in limited practice before the
IRS under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;10.7 uphold the same standards as practitioners and simplified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the structure of that section. In response to a comment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations clarify ambiguous wording in &sect;10.7(c)(1)(vii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed regulations, which relates to representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside of the United States. The change makes clear that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonpractitioner may represent a taxpayer before personnel of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IRS who are located outside of the United States, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the taxpayer is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentator asked that &sect;10.7(c)(1)(viii), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relates to representation before the Examination Division by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparer, be clarified by substituting ``as the preparer'' for ``on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of the taxpayer''. This change, which is not substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in nature, is adopted by the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Expedited Suspensions From Practice Before the Service in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain Cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations added a new section permitting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director of Practice to commence an expedited proceeding leading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a practitioner's suspension from practice before the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in those instances in which an independent authority already has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the practitioner has engaged in serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misconduct. Some commentators recommended against adopting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expedited suspension provision. These commentators argued that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an expedited suspension violates an individual's due process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights and constitutes an abuse of the Director of Practice's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. Alternatively, it was suggested that: (1) An expedited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension be deferred if the individual requests a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before an Administrative Law Judge; (2) the Director be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to take additional steps to ensure that the complaint in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expedited suspension proceeding is properly served; and (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent in such a proceeding be given additional time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to the Director's complaint and not be deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waived his or her right to a conference if the respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
answer is not timely filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acts giving rise to an expedited suspension, such as loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of professional license for misconduct or conviction of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felonies, constitute disreputable conduct under Circular 230. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title 31, section 330(b) of the United States Code requires only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a representative who engages in disreputable conduct be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given notice and an opportunity for a proceeding prior to being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended from practice before the IRS. The expedited suspension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures comply with these and general due process requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by providing a practitioner with reasonable notice of the grounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any proposed suspension and an opportunity to be heard by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director of Practice before the suspension takes effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expedited suspension provision has been carefully drafted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to apply only in limited circumstances, minimize any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities for abuse, and provide individuals with adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural safeguards. For these reasons and considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury's interest in expeditiously handling these cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentators' recommendations on this section of Circular 230 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally were not adopted. However, in response to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the time for responding to a complaint has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased to 30 days. In addition, the scheduling requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a conference with the Director of Practice are relaxed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarified. Under the final regulations, the conference with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director of Practice may be held no sooner than 14 calendar days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the answer is required to be filed, rather than 30 calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the complaint is served, unless the respondent agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an earlier date. The final regulations also provide that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practitioner's loss of his or her professional license solely due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a failure to pay a professional licensing fee will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute grounds for an expedited suspension. The section has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been renumbered and conforming changes made to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

V. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. ``Return'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator asked that the definition of ``return'' of tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;10.2(g) be revised to explicitly state that a return includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an amended return. To eliminate any confusion on this point, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations incorporate this recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. ``Reckless Conduct'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator requested assurances that changes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``reckless conduct'' in &sect;10.51(j) were not intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to substantively change that provision. Other commentators asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the words ``highly unreasonable omission'' be eliminated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced with other words. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the definition of ``reckless conduct'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were intended to streamline that definition without changing its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance. Accordingly, there is no substantive significance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminating the words ``merely simple or inexcusable negligence'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to substituting ``should observe under the circumstances'' for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``is either known or is so obvious that the competent practitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must or should have been aware of it.'' Because no substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change is intended, substantive wording changes suggested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentators to the proposed definition were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Comments Outside the Scope of the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional comments were not adopted because they were beyond the scope of the regulations project. These included:
(1) Altering the definition of ``practice before the Internal Revenue Service'' in &sect;10.2(e); (2) extending
the practice standards to commercial return preparers; (3) requiring a return preparer who is representing a taxpayer
on audit to withdraw from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation if a conflict of interest arises; (4) prescribing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens of proof in disciplinary proceedings (which generally are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act,
5 U.S.C. section 551 et. seq.); and (5) permitting a temporary or part-time employee who is not a practitioner to represent
an employer, partnership, corporation, or trust under the limited practice rules.

It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations and,
therefore, a final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking for the regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Generally.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A practitioner may not charge an unconscionable fee for representing a client in a matter before the Internal Revenue
Service.

Contingent fees for return preparation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A practitioner may not charge a contingent fee for preparing an original return. A practitioner may charge a contingent
fee for preparing an amended return or a claim for refund (other than a claim for refund made on an original return) if
the practitioner reasonably anticipates at the time the fee arrangement is entered into that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amended return or claim will receive substantive review by the Service. A contingent fee includes a fee that is
based on a percentage of the refund shown on a return or a percentage of the taxes saved, or that otherwise depends on
the specific result attained.

_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Realistic possibility standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A practitioner may not sign a return as a preparer if the practitioner determines that the return contains a position
that does not have a realistic possibility of being sustained on its merits (the realistic possibility standard)
unless the position is not frivolous and is adequately disclosed to the Service. A practitioner may not advise a client
to take a position on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return, or prepare the portion of a return on which a position is taken, unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The practitioner determines that the position satisfies the realistic possibility standard; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The position is not frivolous and the practitioner advises the client of any opportunity to avoid the accuracy-related
penalty in section 6662 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by adequately disclosing the position and of the requirements
for adequate disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advising clients on potential penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A practitioner advising a client to take a position on a return, or preparing or signing a return as a preparer, must
inform the client of the penalties reasonably likely to apply to the client with respect to the position advised, prepared,
or reported. The practitioner also must inform the client of any opportunity to avoid any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty by disclosure, if relevant, and of the requirements for adequate disclosure. This paragraph (a)(2) applies
even if the practitioner is not subject to a penalty with respect to the position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relying on information furnished by clients.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A practitioner advising a client to take a position on a return, or preparing or signing a return as a preparer, generally
may rely in good faith without verification upon information furnished by the client. However, the practitioner
may not ignore the implications of information furnished to, or actually known by, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the practitioner, and must make reasonable inquiries if the information as furnished appears to be incorrect, inconsistent,
or incomplete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Realistic possibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A position is considered to have a realistic possibility of being sustained on its merits if a reasonable and well-informed
analysis by a person knowledgeable in the tax law would lead such a person to conclude that the position has approximately
a one in three, or greater, likelihood of being sustained on its merits. The authorities described in 26 CFR 1.6662&hyph;4(d)(3)(iii),
or any successor provision, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial understatement penalty regulations may be taken into account for purposes of this analysis. The possibility
that a position will not be challenged by the Service (e.g., because the taxpayer's return may not be audited or because
the issue may not be raised on audit) may not be taken into account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Frivolous.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A position is frivolous if it is patently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Standard of discipline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As provided in &sect;10.52, only violations of this section that are willful, reckless, or a result of gross incompetence
will subject a practitioner to suspension or disbarment from practice before the Service.

 A proceeding under this section will be instituted by a complaint that names the respondent, is signed by the Director,
is filed in the Director's office, and is served according to the rules set forth in &sect;10.57(a). The complaint
must give a plain and concise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of the allegations that constitute the basis for the proceeding. The complaint, or a separate paper attached
to the complaint, must notify the respondent_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Of the place and due date for filing an answer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That a decision by default may be rendered if the respondent fails to file an answer as required; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

rules set forth in &sect;10.58, except as otherwise provided in this section. A respondent is entitled to a conference
with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director only if the conference is requested in a timely filed answer. If a request for a conference is not made in the
answer or the answer is not timely filed, the respondent will be deemed to have waived his or her right to a conference
and the Director may suspend such respondent at any time following the date on which the answer was due.

be filed with the Director, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent agrees to an earlier date. An authorized representative may represent the respondent at the conference.
Following the conference, upon a finding that the respondent is described in paragraph (b) of this section, or upon
the respondent's failure to appear at the conference either personally or through an authorized representative,
the Director may immediately suspend the respondent from practice before the Service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Director lifts the suspension after determining that the practitioner is no longer described in paragraph
(b) of this section or for any other reason; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The suspension is lifted by an Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary of the Treasury in a proceeding referred

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District, until May 16, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in
advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Friendship Festival Air Show will be conducted over the Niagara River and Buffalo Harbor on July 2 and 3, 1994. This
regulation restricts general navigation on the Niagara River and Buffalo Harbor from the Peace Bridge to the West
Breakwater Light (LLNR 2675) This event will have an estimated 15, domestic and foreign, private and military aircraft
performing low flying aircraft demonstrations and high performance aircraft aerobatics, which could pose hazards
to navigation in the area. Due to the large number of spectator vessels expected, this regulation is needed to provide
for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during the event. Any vessel desiring to transit the
regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station
Buffalo, NY). The Black Rock Canal will remain open to vessel traffic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regular and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District until May 20, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Port Clinton Offshore Grand Prix will be held on Lake Erie on July 9, 1994. This regulation restricts general navigation
on Lake Erie from the East Pierhead Light 1 (LLNR 5870), Port Clinton, OH to The Colony Club Harbor, Catawba Island,
OH. This event will have an estimated 35 offshore Power boats, racing in a closed course on western Lake Erie which could
pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property
during this event. Any vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol
Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Marblehead, OH). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Economic Assessment and Certification

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impractical. Specifically, the sponsor's late submission of the regatta application
left insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in advance of the scheduled event. The Coast Guard
deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation immediately.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The South Sioux Regatta Days consists of a raft race. The event will begin at 10 a.m. and will end at 6 p.m. local time.
In order to provide for the safety of spectators and participants, and for the safe passage of through traffic, the
Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area. The river will be closed during part or all of the effective
period to all vessel traffic except official regatta vessels and patrol craft. These regulations are issued pursuant
to 33 U.S.C. 1233 and 33 CFR 100.35.

of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because of the event's short duration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for a fireworks program located in the East River. This event
will take place on June 24, 1994, from 10:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. and will close all waters of the East River within a
300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards off of East 30th Street, Manhattan,
New York. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the East River and is needed to
protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for not publishing an NPRM as well as making it effective less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Publication. Due to the date this application was received, there was insufficient time to draft and publish a notice
of proposed rulemaking that allows for a reasonable comment period prior to the event. There was also insufficient
time for publication of this temporary final rule 30 days prior to the event. The delay encountered if normal rulemaking
procedures were followed would effectively cancel this event. Cancellation of this event is contrary to public interest.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mary Jane Voute submitted an application to hold a fireworks program in the East River off of 30th Street, Manhattan,
New York. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in all waters of the East River within a 300 yard radius
of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards off of East 30th Street, Manhattan, New York, at
or near 40

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. No vessel traffic will be permitted to transit the East River within a 300 yard
radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards off of East 30th Street, Manhattan, at any
time this safety zone is in effect. Although there is a regular flow of traffic through this area, there is not likely
to be a significant impact on recreational or commercial traffic for several reasons. Due to the limited duration
of the event, the late hour of the event, the extensive, advance advisories that will be made to the maritime community,
and that traffic can safely transit to the east of this safety zone, the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that
this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime
safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination is included in the docket.

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in the Hudson River for the Heritage of Pride Fireworks program.
This event will take place from 9:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 25, and Sunday, June 26, 1994, and will close
all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius from the center of two fireworks barges anchored together 200
yards north of Pier 45, Manhattan, at a point approximately 1000 feet off the Manhattan shoreline. This safety zone
will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the Hudson River and is needed to protect the boating public
from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 30, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 14815) concerning this regulation. Interested persons were requested to submit comments by May 31, 1994. No
comments were received. A public hearing was not requested during this comment period and one was not held. The Captain
of the Port, New York is promulgating the temporary final rule as proposed. Good cause exists for making this rule effective
less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication. Due to the length of the comment period deemed necessary to provide the public with adequate notice,
there is insufficient time to publish this rule 30 days before the event. Making this rule effective in less than 30
days after publication is in the public interest as any delay would effectively cause cancellation of the event.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 27, 1993, Heritage of Pride Incorporated submitted a request to hold a fireworks program in the Hudson
River, New York. following the notice and comment period described above, the Captain of the Port, New York now promulgates
this temporary final rule as proposed. The purpose of this regulation is to establish a safety zone in all waters of
the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius from the center of two fireworks barges anchored together 200 yards north
of Pier 45, Manhattan, at a point approximately 1000 feet off the Manhattan shoreline at or near 40

River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of the Executive Order 12866 and does not
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from
review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of
the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Although there is a regular flow of traffic through
this area, there is not likely to be a significant impact on recreational or commercial traffic for several reasons.
Due to the limited duration of the event, that the event is at a late hour, that extensive, advance advisories will be
made to the maritime community so that mariners' plans may be adjusted accordingly, and that traffic can safely transit
to the west of this safety zone, the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to
be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime
safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to control
vessel traffic in the regulated area to prevent erosion of the pilot channel. The regulation will restrict general
navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property along the
river.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a falling river has contributed to shoaling and necessitated
creation of a pilot channel for safe navigation of the area. As a result, the Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's
best interest to issue a regulation immediately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Lowered river levels have reduced navigational channel depths in this section of the Upper Mississippi River. Shoaling
has resulted in several groundings and the subsequent establishment of a narrow pilot channel. This regulation is
designed to protect the integrity of the pilot channel and to ensure safe navigation of this part of the river. Immediate
publication is required to sustain commercial vessel operation.

This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal; that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10E of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because the restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. Changes will
be announced by Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners
may also call the Port Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current
information.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The application to hold this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone for the Galesville Heritage Society,
Galesville, Maryland fireworks display. The fireworks will be launched from a barge that will be anchored in the mouth
of Parish Creek out over Parish Creek and the West River. The safety zone will encompass all waters of Parish Creek and
the West River which fall within a 500 yard diameter circle with the center of the circle being the anchored fireworks
barge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the main navigable channel of the West River will not be closed during this safety zone, vessel traffic should
not be severely disrupted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spectator vessels that wish to watch the fireworks display may anchor outside of the safety zone, but they may not anchor
in or block a navigable channel.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.

Federalism Assessment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the City of Yonkers Fourth of July fireworks program located
northwest of Yonkers Municipal Pier in the Hudson River. This event will take place on July 4, 1994, from 9 p.m. until
10:30 p.m. with a rain date of July 5, 1994, from 9 p.m. until 10:30 p.m., and will temporarily close all waters of the
Hudson River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 350 yards northwest
of Yonkers Municipal Pier in Yonkers, New York. This safety zone will preclude all vessels from transiting this portion
of the Hudson River, and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding
in the area.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists
for making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the date this application was
received, there was insufficient time to draft and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking that allows for a reasonable
comment period prior to the event. There was also insufficient time for publication of this temporary final rule 30
days prior to the event. The delay encountered if normal rulemaking procedures were followed would effectively cancel
this event. Cancellation of this event is contrary to public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The City of Yonkers submitted an application to hold a fireworks program in the Hudson River. This regulation establishes
a temporary safety zone in all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together
approximately 350 yards northwest of Yonkers Municipal Pier in Yonkers, New York at or near 40

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Although this regulation will prevent traffic from transiting a portion of
the Hudson River, the effect of this regulation will not be significant for several reasons. Due to the fact that the
event is limited in duration, that the event is at a late hour, that extensive, advance advisories will be made to the
maritime community, and that vessels may safely transit to the west of the safety zone, the impact of this regulation
is expected to be minimal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to

impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime
safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination is included in the docket.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A recent review of the procedural rules in 39 CFR part 953 has revealed several references that require updating and
several provisions that require some rewording for further clarity. Moreover, the review has revealed that the rules
could be improved by expressing heretofore implicit requirements (e.g., in &sect;953.17, the requirement to give
the Postal Service's General Counsel notice and the opportunity to respond when the appellant seeks return of matter
found to be nonmailable); by amplifying requirements that were incompletely expressed (e.g., in &sect;953.4, specifying
the steps required for effecting service of notice when the appellant's address is outside the United States; and
in &sect;953.16, specifying ways in which the hearing process may be expedited); and by expressly authorizing summary
judgment to dispose of cases presenting no genuine and material issues of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the sections in part 953 have been changed or modified. Section 953.5, concerning the reply to be made by the
General Counsel, is moved to &sect;953.4; the sections following the expanded &sect;953.4 are consequently renumbered.
The text of &sect;953.1, concerning authority for the rules, &sect;953.14, concerning appeal from an initial decision,
and &sect;953.18, concerning ex parte communications, is carried forward unchanged in the revised rules.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service of notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Upon receiving the appeal, the Recorder shall issue a notice specifying that the Postal Service General Counsel's
reply shall be filed within 15 days of receipt of the notice; and the time and place of the hearing (if one was requested).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Recorder shall promptly serve this notice on the parties as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The notice, with a copy of the appeal, shall be sent to the General Counsel at Postal Service headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the appellant's address is within the United States, the notice, with a copy of the appeal, shall be sent to
the postmaster at the office that delivers mail to the appellant's address. The postmaster shall be instructed that,
acting personally or through a supervisory employee or a postal inspector, he or she is to serve these documents on
the appellant. If the appellant cannot be found within 3 days, the postmaster shall send these documents to the appellant
by ordinary mail and forward a statement to the Recorder that is signed by the delivering employee and that specifies
the time and place of delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When the appellant's address is outside the United States, the notice, with a copy of the appeal, shall be sent
to the appellant by registered airmail, return receipt requested. A written statement by the Recorder, noting the
time and place of mailing, shall be accepted as proof of service in the event a signed and dated return receipt is not
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reply.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The General Counsel shall file a written reply, in triplicate, with the Recorder, within the aforementioned 15-day
period or any extension granted by the presiding officer for good cause shown. If the General Counsel's reply fails
to address any allegation in the appeal, that allegation shall be deemed admitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Motion for summary judgment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Upon motion of either the General Counsel or the appellant, or on the presiding officer's own initiative, the presiding
officer may find that the appeal and answer present no genuine and material issues of fact requiring an evidentiary
hearing, and thereupon may render an initial decision upholding or reversing the determination or ruling. The initial
decision shall become the final Agency decision if a timely appeal is not taken.

Hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In general, admissibility of evidence at hearings conducted under this part hinges on relevancy and materiality.
However, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice, or by considerations of undue delay, or by needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Testimony shall
be given under oath or affirmation, and witnesses are subject to cross-examination. Stipulations of fact are encouraged
and may be received in evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections
relied upon. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the presiding officer.
Rulings on such objections shall be a part of the transcript. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Formal exceptions to the rulings of the presiding officer made during the course of the hearing are unnecessary.
For all purposes for which an exception otherwise would be taken, it is sufficient that a party, when the ruling of the
presiding officer is made or sought, makes known the action he desires the presiding officer to take or his objection
to an action taken, and his grounds therefor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Either party may request the other to consider informal disposition of any question of mailability, and the scheduled
hearing date may be postponed by the presiding officer for such period of time as may be necessary to accommodate settlement
discussions between the parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a timely reply to the appeal is not filed, the presiding officer shall refer the appeal to the Judicial Officer, who
may find that the General Counsel is in default. Whenever the General Counsel has been deemed to be in default, the Judicial
Officer shall take whatever action on the appeal he deems appropriate. If an oral evidentiary hearing is to be held,
the appellant may appear at the hearing in person or by counsel. If either party fails to appear at the hearing, the presiding
officer shall receive the evidence of the party appearing and render a decision.

(a) Not later than the date fixed for the filing of the reply, a party may file a motion that the scheduled hearing be held
at a place other than that designated in the notice. The motion shall include a supporting statement outlining: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The evidence to be offered in such place; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The names and addresses of the witnesses who will testify; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The reasons why such evidence cannot be presented in Washington, DC. (b) In ruling on the motion, the presiding
officer shall consider the convenience and necessity of the parties and the relevancy of the evidence to be offered.

Unless given orally at the conclusion of the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall render an initial decision
as expeditiously as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing and the receipt of the proposed findings and conclusions,
if any. The initial decision shall become the decision of the Postal Service if an appeal is not perfected. When the
Judicial Officer presides at the hearing, his powers shall include those of an Administrative Law Judge, but the Judicial
Officer may render either an initial or final decision. Exceptions may be filed to an initial decision rendered by
the Judicial Officer in accordance with &sect;953.13.

Officer is presiding) or the final Agency decision (if the Judicial Officer is presiding) rendered orally at the conclusion
of the hearing. The presiding officer may grant or deny any such motion. The parties may, with the concurrence of the

Mail matter found to be nonmailable shall be held at the post office where detained for a period of 15 days from the date
of the Postal Service decision, unless that period is extended by the Judicial Officer. During this holding period,
the appellant may apply for the withdrawal of the matter. If any such application is made, the General Counsel shall
be given notice and the opportunity to oppose the application. Upon the expiration of the holding period with no application
having been made, the Judicial Officer shall order that the matter be disposed of in accordance with 39 U.S.C. 3001(b).
If a timely application is made, the Judicial Officer shall consider the application and any reasons advanced by the
General Counsel for denying the application. The Judicial Officer shall thereafter order either that the matter
be returned to the applicant or that it be disposed of in accordance with 39 U.S.C. 3001(b).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information. Today's amendment is prompted by the Office of
Management and Budget's recent renewal of the Boilers and Industrial Furnaces, General Facility Standards, Part
B Permit Application and Permit Modifications, and Specific Units and Special Wastes ICRs. The affected regulations
are codified at 40 CFR part(s) 264, 265, 266, and 270. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers in a consolidated
table format to be codified in 40 CFR Part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each CFR volume containing EPA regulations.
The table lists the section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers.
This display of the OMB control number(s) and its (their) subsequent codification in the Code of Federal Regulations
satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICRs were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be unnecessary. For the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approves Indiana's 1990 base year ozone precursor emission
inventories for certain ozone nonattainment areas as a revision to the Indiana ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP).
The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing
ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with USEPA guidance.
The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking are: Evansville
(Vanderburgh County); Indianapolis (Marion County); Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart
(Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties). (The emission inventories for Lake and Porter Counties, the only other ozone nonattainment
areas, will be addressed in a separate rulemaking action.) In the proposed rules section of this

I. Emission Inventory Policy and Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing
to the violation of a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), to track these emissions over time, and to ensure
that control strategies are being implemented that reduce emissions and move areas towards attainment of the NAAQS.
States containing ozone nonattainment areas are required, under section 182(a)(1) of the Act, to submit by November
15, 1992, a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions (emissions of Volatile
Organic Compounds (VOC), Oxides of Nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) for each ozone nonattainment area. This inventory must include base year (1990) emissions
from point, area, on-road mobile, and non-road mobile anthropogenic (man-made) sources and biogenic (natural or
plant generated) sources in the ozone nonattainment area(s) and the ozone precursor emissions from major stationary
sources (with VOC, CO, or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions equal to or exceeding 100 tons per year) located within 25 miles of the nonattainment area(s). The emissions
inventory must be established for the peak ozone season (those months when peak hourly ozone concentrations occur
in excess of the primary ozone NAAQS, generally June through August in Indiana) and must represent typical weekday
emissions. Available guidance for preparing and reviewing the emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble
to Title I of the Act. See 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992). Additional guidance is identified in the Technical Support Document
(TSD) for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also requires States with ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate, serious, severe, or extreme
to submit a plan by November 15, 1993, to reduce VOC emissions by 15 percent by November 15, 1996. The baseline level
of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year emissions
inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable toward the 15 percent Reasonable
Further Progress (RFP) requirement. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary emissions inventory from
which the RFP projection inventory, future periodic inventories, and attainment demonstration modeling inventories
are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purposes can be found in the ``Emission Inventory
Requirements for Ozone State Implementation Plans,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a primary tool for the review of the quality of emission inventory submittals, the USEPA has developed three levels
(I, II, and III) of emission inventory quality assurance review checklists. The Level I and II reviews are used to determine
that all required components of the base year emission inventory and its associated documentation are present. These
reviews also evaluate the level of quality of the supporting documentation and data provided by the State and assess
whether the emission estimates were developed according to current USEPA guidance. The Level III review evaluates
10 crucial aspects and the overall acceptability of the emission inventory submittal. Failure to meet one of these
crucial aspects would lead to disapproval of the emission inventory submittal. The 10 crucial requirements of the
emission inventory submittal are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) must be submitted by the State and approved by the USEPA. In addition, a Quality
Assurance (QA) plan contained within the IPP must have been implemented and documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The emission inventory submittal must contain adequate documentation showing the procedures and input data used
and the input data sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The point source portion of the inventory must be complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated in accordance with current USEPA guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The area source portion of the inventory must be complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The area source emissions must have been calculated in accordance with current USEPA policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The biogenic emissions must have been calculated using USEPA's PC-Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (PC-BEIS)
or other equivalent techniques in accordance with current USEPA guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) estimates used in the calculation of on-road mobile source emissions must have
been developed in accordance with USEPA guidance and must have been adequately documented in the inventory submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The MOBILE emission factor model must have been correctly applied to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle
classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Non-road mobile source emissions must have been prepared in accordance with current USEPA guidance for all of
the non-road source categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The base year emission inventory may be approved if it passes the Level I, II, and III reviews. Detailed Level I and II
review procedures and questions can be found in the ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories,''
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, July 27, 1992. Level III review procedures and criteria are specified in a memorandum from David Mobley,
Emission Inventory Branch, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
to the Chief of the Regulation Development Branch, Region V, et. al., title ``Final Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance
Criteria,'' October 7, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing and submitting SIP revisions,
including the base year emissions inventory submittal. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each SIP revision
submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Final approval of the emissions inventory
will not occur until the State revises the emissions inventory to address public comments.

II. Indiana's Emission Inventory Submittals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 15, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted the final, adopted base
year ozone precursor emissions inventories for the Evansville, Louisville, and South Bend/Elkhart ozone nonattainment
areas. On February 14, 1994, the City of Indianapolis (acting for the State of Indiana) submitted the final, adopted
base year ozone precursor emissions inventory for the Indianapolis ozone nonattainment area. The emission inventory
submittals cover the emissions of VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and CO for the following ozone nonattainment areas: Evansville (Vanderburgh County); Indianapolis (Marion County);
Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart (Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties). (The emission
inventories for Lake and Porter Counties, the only other ozone nonattainment areas, will be addressed in a separate
rulemaking action.) In addition to emissions from the ozone nonattainment areas, the submittals also cover VOC,
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and CO emissions from major stationary sources (with actual emissions for any of the covered pollutants equal to
or in excess of 100 tons per year) in all counties located within 25 miles of the ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to developing the base year emission inventories, the State of Indiana developed an IPP as required by the USEPA.
This IPP was approved by the USEPA in March 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions contained in the emission inventories cover the general source categories of stationary point sources
(or simply point sources), area sources, on-road mobile sources, off-road mobile sources, and biogenic sources.
Emission inventory summary tables in the submittal include a more detailed source category breakdown as requested
by the USEPA. All emission summaries were accompanied by documentation covering the sources and values of input data
and by sample calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine up-to-date point source emissions, the State and the City of Indianapolis, respectively, sent emission
inventory questionnaires to all facilities contained in the State's Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS)
and to all sources which hold an air emissions permit issued by the State or by the City of Indianapolis. The City of Indianapolis
for Marion County and the State for Vanderburgh, Clark, Floyd, St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties. The questionnaires
contained all key data fields necessary to calculate typical summer weekday emissions. To assure full coverage of
emitting point sources, the State also consulted other data sources, such as manufacturer's listings, newly issued
construction permits, and other databases, including Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title
III, section 313 summaries, and the Toxic Release Inventory. Similarly, the City of Indianapolis also consulted
other data sources and utilized direct company inquiries to assure the completeness of data.

The point source portions of the emission inventories include detailed facility-specific emission listings with
emissions determined at the segment level and at the facility total level. Point source emissions at these source
levels were listed for all facilities in the ozone nonattainment areas with emissions of VOC or NO

, and CO emissions for a given facility. Point source emissions were calculated using emission factors contained
in AIRS or using techniques outlined in the approved IPP. Emission factors used were generally obtained from the AIRS
Facility Subsystem (AFS), AP&hyph;42 Compilation of Air Pollution Emission Factors, National Acid Precipitation
Assessment Program emission inventory, direct stack test data, and other USEPA guidelines. The point source listings
included with emission inventory submittals (on file at the Region 5 office) identify the emission factors, source
activity levels or throughputs, operating schedules, control equipment efficiencies, and rule effectiveness
estimates (a default 80 percent rule effectiveness level was used for most sources) used for each facility and facility
segment.

Area source emissions were calculated using a variety of information sources and guidance from the USEPA. Where appropriate,
point source emissions have been subtracted from the calculated area source emissions to account for source coverage
overlap. For all appropriate source categories, the State and the City of Indianapolis assumed a rule effectiveness
level of 80 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing the area source emissions, the State and the City of Indianapolis used the following USEPA guidance documents:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;81&hyph;026d, revised July 1989. The new Volume IV guidance, issued in the Spring of 1992,
was used to estimate railroad and aircraft emissions. Estimates of other off-road mobile source emissions were based
on USEPA's 1991 off-road mobile source emission study. In making other area source estimates, the State and the City
of Indianapolis followed the approved IPP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has entered the calculated area source emission estimates into USEPA's AIRS Area and Mobile Source System
(AIRS/AMS). The data are well documented in both hardcopy and in computer data files submitted with the emission inventory
submittals as additional documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On-road mobile source emissions were calculated using USEPA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (as revised in 1989) and USEPA's MOBILE5A model. Daily Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and speed data by county and roadway
type were obtained from the Indiana Department of Transportation (InDOT), who used the Highway Performance Monitoring
System (HPMS) to determine VMT by roadway functional class. The VMT provided by InDOT were annual average daily traffic
levels. Insufficient data existed to allow the VMT to be adjusted to the summer months and the day of week levels. To
quality assure the VMT estimates, the local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) were requested to confirm
the VMT estimates or to correct them if needed based on more representative data. The VMT were quality assured through
comparison with current roadway traffic counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MPOs recommended vehicle speeds based on the use of local transportation models (the MINUTP transportation model
was used in the Evansville, Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties, Indiana), and South Bend/Elkhart areas, while
the City of Indianapolis chose to use the default speeds recommended by the USEPA in MOBILE5A). The speeds derived
using the MINUTP transportation model were on average higher than the default speeds recommended by the USEPA. Nonetheless
the MPOs believe the model-generated speeds are more representative of their areas than the recommended default
speeds and are justified on observations of actual traffic flow rates (no monitored speeds were presented to defend
these conclusions). The estimated speeds were used in conjunction with USEPA recommended defaults for vehicle mixtures
to determine emission rates for each roadway type. Fuel volatility was assumed to comply with USEPA requirements
for the areas. The ambient temperatures used in the mobile source emissions modeling were derived from the average
maximum and minimum temperatures on the ten highest ozone days for the period of 1988 through 1990 for each area using
an approach recommended by the USEPA. The emission factors determined using MOBILE5A were combined with the total
VMT for each functional roadway class to determine the total mobile source emissions for each county. All parameters
used in the mobile source emissions modeling, including the parameters used by the MOBILE5A model, were well documented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The biogenic emissions for each of the counties were determined using USEPA's PC-BEIS model. Included in the documentation
of the applications of this model were descriptions of the methodology used to determine temperature inputs for the
model. The temperature inputs were determined using the technique recommended by the USEPA. The applications of
PC-BEIS also included the use of land use data supplied by the USEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Indiana held public hearings on the Evansville, Clark and Floyd Counties, and South Bend/Elkhart emission
inventories on June 28, 1993, and July 6, 1993. Comments received during these public hearings were used to make appropriate
corrections in the emission inventories. A public hearing on the Indianapolis emission inventory submittal was
held on November 5, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emissions in units of tons/day for an average day are summarized below:

III. Final Rulemaking Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The USEPA has conducted Level I, II, and III quality assurance reviews of the emission inventory submittals and has
concluded that the State of Indiana has met the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act by submitting ozone precursor
emission inventories that include comprehensive, accurate, and current actual emissions from all identified sources
in the subject ozone nonattainment areas. In particular, the Indiana submittals meet the 10 crucial criteria contained
in the Level III quality assurance review. The emission inventories are, therefore, approved for incorporation
in the SIP as satisfying the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because USEPA considers this action to be noncontroversial and routine, the USEPA is approving it without prior approval.
This action will become effective on August 19, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by July 20, 1994,
then the USEPA will publish a notice that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received in response
to this final rule in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed
rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The comment period will not be extended or reopened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of the Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Tables 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it
rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this section should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan revision submitted by the Governor of Wyoming on November 1, 1993
for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program (PROGRAM). This PROGRAM satisfies the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act (Act) to ensure that small businesses
have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Act. Since this Program
does not impose any new regulatory burdens on small businesses, and because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial
amendment and anticipates no adverse comments, the EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for this approval follows.

I. Background of Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the federally approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to oversee these Programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the Act. In February 1992, the EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wyoming has submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order
to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment
of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;
(2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness
of the SBAP.

II. Summary of Submittal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 03 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The deadline for submittal of the PROGRAM to EPA was November 15, 1992. The state of Wyoming did not meet this deadline,
and on January 15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit the PROGRAM pursuant to section 179(a)(1) of the Act
in a letter to the Governor of Wyoming. Within 18 months of the date of the finding, the state was to make a complete submittal
of their PROGRAM to avoid the imposition of sanctions authorized under section 110(m) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wyoming Environmental Quality Council adopted the final version of the PROGRAM on September 17, 1993, as authorized
by the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act, Article 2, Sections 35&hyph;11&hyph;209 through 35&hyph;11&hyph;211.
The Wyoming PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Wyoming on November 1, 1993 as an addition to the Wyoming
SIP. It was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness. In a letter dated November 22, 1993,
EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive determination on the submittal. After
receiving the additional information in a letter dated November 30, 1993, EPA notified the State in a letter to the
Governor dated December 13, 1993 that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. At that time,
the State of Wyoming had met all of the requirements of section 507 and the 18 month sanctions clock was terminated.
The submittal was then reviewed for approvability by EPA Region VIII and EPA Headquarters, and received a concurrence
from all reviewers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this
requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``track the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices for proposed and new standards and utilize EPA's informational systems ... to provide notice of proposed
standards, new standards, and compliance time frames and to assist and provide affected sources with various compliance
methods and technologies ....'' The State will additionally ``continue to provide the small business community
with technical assistance such as process and control technologies and, if required and sufficient resources exist,
perform computer modeling analyses.'' The mechanisms the State has committed to use to accomplish this include ``...
coordinate with the Small Business Administration, Ombudsman and other Department officials to disseminate compliance
and technical information in a timely manner through: (a) Various trade and interest groups .... (b) Public service
announcements. (c) Seminars and workshops. (d) Information packets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The
State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``... provide technical expertise
for ... assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection
and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products
and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.'' The mechanisms the State has committed to use to accomplish
this are stated in 1. above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP
revision to ``... assist small businesses in meeting the requirements necessary to process the operating permits
in an expeditious manner ....'' The State will accomplish this by determining applicable requirements as stated
in 1. above. Additionally, the State has committed to ``... continue to inform affected facilities through direct
mailing of any applicable proposed or final regulations or standards issued under the Operating Permit Program or
the Clean Air Act or adopted through the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``... inform the
small business stationary sources of their rights under the Clean Air Act.'' The mechanisms the State has committed
to use to accomplish this are stated in 1. above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The State
has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, pages 5 and 6 of its SIP revision to ``... assist small businesses
in meeting the requirements necessary to process the operating permits in an expeditious manner and encourage lawful
cooperation and compliance with the Clean Air Act ....'' The State ``... will maintain a list of consultants who may
provide audits for small business stationary sources.'' As resources allow, the State ``... may conduct audits of
small business stationary sources to determine compliance or non-compliance with any rules, regulations, standards,
permits or orders ....''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary
source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement
by committing in Addendum 1, pages 5 and 6 of its SIP revision to ``... consider any request from a small business stationary
source for modification of: (a) Any work practice or technological methods of compliance. (b) The schedule of milestones
for implementing a work practice or method of compliance ....'' The procedures the State will use to accomplish this
include determining the ``... technological and financial capability of the small business stationary source,''
and not granting any modification ``... unless it is in compliance with the applicable requirements established
pursuant to Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations, the Clean Air Act, and the requirements of the Operating
Permit Program.'' Additionally, the State will ``... provide in a timely manner the Ombudsman with all small business
operating permits and any small business requests for operational change and modification.''

B. Ombudsman
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has met the second PROGRAM element, the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the
interests of small businesses in the regulatory process, by committing in Addendum 1, page 2 of its SIP revision to
locate the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Department of Environmental Quality, but separate from
the Division of Air Quality. Addendum 1, page 4 of the State's SIP revision details the responsibilities and authorities
of the Ombudsman, including ``... act for and on behalf of the small business stationary sources in connection with
the implementation of the operating permit program and the 1990 Clean Air Amendments ....''

C. Compliance Advisory Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third PROGRAM element is the creation of a CAP to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
The CAP must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses;
four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member
selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The Act also delineates four responsibilities
of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered
and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence
to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; (3) to review and assure that information for small businesses is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and disseminate
the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However,
since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require
the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has met these requirements by committing in Addendum 1, pages 2 and 3 of its SIP revision to appoint the members
of the CAP as stated above, and to designate to the CAP the four responsibilities listed in the Act. Two additional members
will be appointed by the Governor who represent major source operators in the State. The State considers the two additional
CAP members to be appropriate because the operating permit fees from major sources fund the PROGRAM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the Act defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wyoming has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
Act. This mechanism is contained in the Addendum 1, page 1 of the State's SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wyoming has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet
the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Act but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all pollutants.
This provision is contained in Addendum 1, page 1 of the State's SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wyoming has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. This provision is contained in Addendum 1, page 2 of
the State's SIP revision.

III. Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Wyoming. This SIP revision implements
each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the Act. Addendum 1, page 7 of the State's SIP revision contains
a schedule of milestones which show implementation of the PROGRAM by November 15, 1994. The EPA is therefore approving
this submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the State. Because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

The Environmental Protection Agency today is correcting the listing for ``beryllium'' in the list of commercial
chemical products that are hazardous wastes when discarded or intended to be discarded. The listing description
is corrected to read ``Beryllium powder.'' Conforming changes also are being made to the RCRA list of hazardous constituents,
the RCRA land disposal restrictions technology-based treatment standards, and to the CERCLA list of hazardous substances.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1988, EPA published a technical corrections notice to make a number of corrections to 40 CFR 261.33(e)
and (f) and to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 (53 FR 13383). In that notice, the word ``dust'' was inadvertently omitted
from the 40 CFR 261.33(e) listing, ``P015_Beryllium dust,'' which was the original listing promulgated on May 19,
1980. There have been a number of inquiries since the April 22, 1988 correction notice as to the intent of this listing,
and EPA has responded in each case by explaining that the word ``dust'' was mistakenly omitted, but the intent of the
listing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, to list as hazardous the commercial chemical product, beryllium dust, when discarded or intended to be discarded)
has remained. In fact, the land disposal restrictions refer to P015 as ``Beryllium dust.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the sole manufacturer of the commercial chemical product has indicated that ``beryllium powder'' is
the actual term used to describe their product. The term dust is not used by industry to describe the commercial chemical
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of clarification, EPA is adding the word ``powder'' to the P015 listing description. Since this change
is only a clarification, the scope of the P015 hazardous waste listing is neither increased, diminished or otherwise
affected by this technical correction amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to rectify this confusion in the regulated community, the Agency today is correcting the Code of Federal Regulations
by adding the word ``powder'' to the P015 listing for beryllium. Conforming changes also are being made to the RCRA
list of hazardous constituents, the RCRA land disposal restrictions technology-based treatment standards, and
to the CERCLA list of hazardous substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this action is a technical correction, prior notice and opportunity for comment is unnecessary, and good
cause exists for this change to take effect immediately (see 5 U.S.C. 553(b)). Accordingly, the Agency is not seeking
any comments based on today's notice.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission amended its rules governing the low power television (LPTV) service in three respects. First, the
Commission relaxed its strict acceptance standard for new and major change applications. Second, the Commission
expanded the waiver policy regarding terrain shielding. Third, the Commission will now permit LPTV operators to
request four-letter call signs with the suffix ``LP'' rather than the current five-character call signs consisting

Introduction

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On April 22, 1993, the Commission released its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;114, 8 FCC Rcd 2770 (1993). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission proposed to amend the rules and policies governing the low power television (LPTV) service, which
includes LPTV stations and television translator stations. Specifically, we proposed to modify our current standard
for acceptance of applications and to expand our waiver policy regarding terrain shielding. We also proposed to permit
LPTV operators to use four-letter call signs rather than the current five-character call signs consisting of letters
and numbers. These proposals raised little disagreement among commenters and are adopted in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed to narrow the definition of what constitutes a major LPTV station modification. That issue generated significantly
more diverse comment and requires further consideration. It will be resolved at a later date so as not to delay implementation
of the changes we adopt herein.

2. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission noted that the volume of LPTV applications has decreased and the quality of those submissions has
improved as a result of the strict standard requiring that an LPTV applicant be ``complete and sufficient'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., ``letter perfect'') at the close of an LPTV filing window.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 We pointed out that currently, applications that are not letter perfect are returned, forcing applicants to wait
until the Commission opens a subsequent filing window to correct their submissions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 73.3564(a)(2). The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concluded that the strict standard has achieved its purpose of encouraging applicants to submit complete and carefully
prepared applications, so as to alleviate the LPTV application backlog with which the Commission was faced. We therefore
proposed that applications be judged on a ``substantially complete'' basis similar to that used in processing full-power
television applications, whereby applications are considered acceptance if they are not patently defective. As
an alternative to the substantially complete standard, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 suggested a mid-level acceptance standard requiring the application to be more than substantially complete but
less than letter perfect.

3. The commenters in this proceeding, who include LPTV licensees, consulting engineers, other broadcasters, law
firms and educational institutions, overwhelmingly support adoption of a relaxed standard for acceptance of applications.
They agree with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the letter perfect standard is no longer necessary due to the decreased volume of LPTV applications. They also
assert that the letter perfect requirement unfairly forces LPTV applicants filing defective applications to wait
to refile in the next filing window, which sometimes does not open for a year. Further, commenters assert that a relaxed
standard is more appropriate in
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
light of the limited resources of most LPTV applicants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. We will revise our LPTV application acceptance standards and adopt a ``substantially complete'' test. We agree
with the overwhelming majority of commenters that the strict acceptance standard is no longer necessary in light
of the reduced number of LPTV applications being filed with the Commission and in light of the improved quality of those
applications. We are persuaded by the comments and by our processing experience to favor the substantially complete
standard over a mid-level standard. We do not believe that the substantially complete standard will lead to a lessening
of the overall quality of LPTV application submissions, nor significantly delay the authorization of LPTV service.
Conversely, this standard will enable the authorization of more stations for each filing window. We believe that
this modification of our application acceptance standards will greatly benefit LPTV applicants, many of whom have
limited resources. We note that while we will give applicants an opportunity to cure defects in otherwise substantially
complete applications, the corrected application must adhere to the Commission's rules and policies. For instance,
if an amendment to an application eliminates predicted interference to one station but at the same time introduces
interference to another station, the amended application will not be accepted and will be returned. Similarly, an
application that is not substantially complete, that is not submitted with the proper fee, or that is not timely filed
cannot be cured via subsequent amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission has developed a body of case law over the years governing broadcast applications that were subject
to the substantially complete standard.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 From these decisions, certain criteria were established, even though each case turned on the particular facts involved.
In the cases where applications failed the test, it was found that many sections of the applications were deficient
to a significant degree or were omitted entirely, so as to lack sufficient information regarding the adequacy of the
proposals vis-a-vis the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Amendments were allowed to correct errors, unless the application, judged as a whole, was ``so patently violative
of the rules as to make its processing a futile gesture.''

6. Following these precedents, the staff will consider applications as not substantially complete, and therefore
subject to dismissal as patently defective, if they omit all of or large portions of several sections of the application.
This test reflects the criteria applied by the Commission in prior cases decided under this standard, while recognizing
the differences in the current LPTV application form (FCC Form 346). Additionally, in accordance with longstanding
Commission policy, an application found to have been filed without reasonable assurance of site availability will
not be considered substantially complete and will be dismissed as patently defective.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 It has been the experience of the staff that very few LPTV applications are submitted to the Commission in a condition
not meeting this substantial completeness test. The simplified format of the LPTV applicant form, which generally
specifies the exact information to be submitted in boxes rather than in narrative exhibits, serves to guide applicants
in successfully completing the form.

Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, applicants filing substantially complete applications containing defects or omissions will be given an opportunity
to cure the defects. If the defect prevents the staff from further processing the application, a deficiency letter
will be issued and the applicant will have 30 days from the date of that letter to correct the defect. If the defect does
not prevent processing, the staff will not send a deficiency letter until it completes pre-acceptance studies on
the application or until a subsequent defect prevents further processing, at which time the applicant will be given
30 days to amend. Applicants will be given one opportunity to amend for each deficiency letter received. Applications
revised to correct all defects identified by the staff and that do not introduce any new defects will then be listed
as ``Accepted for Filing'' in a public notice, either in the form of a lottery announcement notice for mutually-exclusive
applications or a ``proposed grant list'' for non-mutually-exclusive applications. Any amendment submitted to
correct a defective application must be a minor amendment and must otherwise be acceptable in all respects.

Terrain Shielding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. The Commission's present terrain shielding policy in the LPTV service provides that the Commission will waive
its application acceptance standards for predicted interference when it is demonstrated that, due to the existence
of intervening terrain, an applicant's proposed operation will not cause interference to another facility.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Consideration of waivers based on terrain shielding is currently limited to LPTV applications that are not mutually-exclusive
with other applications submitted during a particular filing window. We proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to broaden the circumstances in which terrain shielding waivers can be used in the authorization of LPTV service.
Because the volume of applications is now manageable, we stated that it was administratively feasible to expand the
terrain waiver policy to include mutually-exclusive applications. In this regard, we proposed to consider an applicant's
terrain shielding showing with respect to a protected broadcast facility, even if that application is mutually-exclusive
with another timely filed LPTV application(s), allowing the application to be accepted for filing.

Without consideration of terrain, proposed facilities in mutually-exclusive applications, by definition, are
predicted to interfere with each other to the extent that not all of them can be granted. Under our proposal, applicants
for nearby LPTV facilities using the same channel but separated by terrain obstructions could all be granted, without
involvement in the Commission's random selection (

10. No commenter opposes our proposals to expand our waiver policy regarding terrain shielding to mutually-exclusive
applicants and to permit applicants to consider terrain shielding as a basis for resolving situations of mutual exclusivity.
Commenters support these proposals as a practical approach to acceptance of applications that more realistically
reflects a station's actual potential to interfere with another station. Some commenters also propose changes to
our existing terrain shielding procedures.

Commission Policy Regarding Terrain Shielding,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 3 FCC Rcd 7105 (1988), we concluded that case-by-case evaluation of terrain shielding ``affords the administrative
flexibility to select from among available prediction models one that applies to the topographic features in each
case.'' The existing flexible guidelines have worked well in practice and we see no need to revise them. Moreover,
we believe that modifications to our current policy would be at odds with our aim in this proceeding, which is to streamline
the LPTV application process. We decline, therefore, to pursue further in this proceeding these suggested modifications
to our current LPTV terrain shielding policy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. We will adopt the proposals advanced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regarding terrain shielding waivers. We believe that if intervening terrain prevents an LPTV applicant from interfering
with other LPTV or full-power TV stations or other LPTV facilities proposed in pending applications, the applicant
should be permitted to take that situation into account, regardless of whether the application is mutually-exclusive
with another LPTV application. The proposals we adopt in this proceeding do not affect the nature of applicants' terrain
shielding waiver submissions, nor the manner in which the staff evaluates such submissions, as provided in the Commission's
LPTV 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrain Shielding Policy Statement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. LPTV applicants seeking terrain shielding waivers should continue to follow the existing criteria for demonstrating
noninterference based on terrain considerations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 submitting either detailed profiles of the terrain in pertinent directions toward the protected signal contours
of potentially affected stations or letters of assent from the licensees of such stations, agreeing that terrain
shielding would prevent interference but without surrendering the right to be protected against any actual interference.
Also, mutually-exclusive applicants may now use either of these methods to demonstrate that their respective station
proposals could co-exist without an interference conflict.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Further, while we strongly urge applicants to fully address applicable terrain shielding conditions at the initial
application stage, we will accept a satisfactory terrain shielding showing for the first time in response to a deficiency
letter. We believe that this will facilitate the initiation of new or modified LPTV station operations by treating
the omission of terrain shielding data like any other error in an otherwise substantially complete application and
giving the applicant an opportunity to make appropriate corrections.

We reiterate that where two mutually-exclusive applicants choose to resolve the exclusivity by agreeing that interference
between their two facilities would not be likely due to the existence of intervening terrain, the parties will be responsible
for eliminating any interference that might occur, and the parties are expected to cooperate fully to that end.

12. In adopting the LPTV terrain shielding proposals in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we are simply removing administrative barriers that were necessary when the LPTV 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrain Shielding Policy Statement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was first established. Had the current LPTV application processing climate existed at that time, we would not have
found it necessary to limit consideration of terrain shielding among LPTV applicants. In the more than five years
since its adoption, our terrain policy has enabled the grant of more than 200 LPTV and TV translator stations that otherwise
would not have been possible. The policy also has been successful in terms of interference protection. LPTV stations
are not permitted to interfere with the regularly viewed signals and programs of full-power TV stations. We know of
no instance in which the grant of a terrain shielding waiver in the LPTV service has resulted in interference to the
reception of another broadcast facility. Thus, our broadening of eligible LPTV applicants for terrain shielding
waivers should not increase the likelihood that LPTV stations will cause interference to the reception of full-power
TV stations.

Call Signs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we proposed to amend our rules to permit LPTV stations to request four-letter call signs rather than the five-character
alpha-numeric call signs that are currently assigned. We stated our belief that such a modification may be competitively
beneficial to the LPTV industry and may reduce confusion to viewers, who are accustomed to four-letter call signs.
We proposed to append a distinctive suffix such as ``LP'' to any LPTV four-letter call sign to avoid confusion with
full-power television stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 presented two options for assigning four-letter call signs. Under the first option, four-letter call signs would
be permitted only for LPTV stations that meet certain threshold requirements, including a minimum number of hours
of operation and a given amount of locally originated programming, as well as other requirements currently imposed
on full-power stations such as the multiple ownership, children's programming, main studio and public file requirements.
Alternatively, the second option would permit all LPTV stations to request four-letter call signs upon applying
for a license. We stated our inclination to favor the second option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. No commenter opposes permitting LPTV stations to use four-letter call signs, and all parties specifying a preference
prefer the second option. Commenters contend that four-letter call signs will facilitate marketing and will be easier
to include in ratings books and ratings surveys. They also argue that four-letter call signs will alleviate public
confusion regarding the nature of LPTV stations; they submit that the current call signs can lead the public to mistake
LPTV stations for amateur radio operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Most commenters, primarily LPTV operators, oppose the adoption of an ``LP'' suffix as unnecessarily segregating
LPTV stations from full-power television stations. They analogize that licensees in different broadcast services
use four-letter call signs without any suffix requirement. For example, they note, a Class A FM station is not designated
any differently from a Class C FM station, nor do AM daytimers have to distinguish themselves from full-time AM stations.
Some of these commenters suggest that if the Commission does require a suffix, the suffix should be ``CT'' (for ``community
television''), ``TX'' (as used in the FCC TV engineering database), or ``TV.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

17. Another area in which some commenters differ with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 deals with when an LPTV station should be eligible to request a four-letter call sign. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed to award four-letter call signs at the time the LPTV license is applied for rather than at the construction
permit stage. Several commenters contend that early assignment of a four-letter call sign will allow the LPTV station
to more effectively market itself to the public.

18. All initial construction permits for LPTV stations will continue to be issued with a five-character alpha-numeric
call sign. However, we will permit any LPTV station that so chooses to request a four-letter call sign, without threshold
operating requirements, after receiving its construction permit.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 We stated our belief in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that only licensed LPTV stations should be able to apply for four-letter call signs because many LPTV construction
permits never become operational. We recognize commenters' concerns, however, that LPTV operators need to have
four-letter call signs as early as possible to effectively market their stations to the public. One commenter suggests
that an LPTV station be permitted to apply for a four-letter call sign at any time after issuance of the initial construction
permit if the request is accompanied by a certification that a firm equipment order has been placed or that physical
construction is underway at the transmitter site. We believe that this limited restriction is not unreasonable in
that it will not unduly burden LPTV permittees and will promote efficient use of Commission resources. Accordingly,
a permittee requesting a four-letter call sign must include with that request a certification that it has placed a
firm equipment order, which includes a down payment for such major components as a transmitter or a transmitting antenna,
that physical construction is underway at the transmitter site or that the station has been constructed. In addition,
permittees, as well as LPTV licensees requesting a four-letter call sign, must also submit the drug certification
statement required by Section 1.2002 of the Commission's Rules. By a later public notice, a schedule will be established
by which licensees and permittees will be able to apply for four-letter call signs. Those stations in operation for
the longest period of time will have the opportunity to apply first.

All initial LPTV construction permits will be issued with a five-character LPTV call sign. TV translator stations
appear to have no need for four-letter call signs and therefore will not be eligible to request them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
There are now 1,400 licensed LPTV stations and an additional 1,300 outstanding LPTV construction permits, which
represent a potentially large number of requests for modified call signs. Accordingly, we believe that a phased implementation
of the new LPTV call sign policy is necessary to ensure expeditious handling of call sign requests and the avoidance
of delays. A fair and flexible means of accomplishing this is first to accept requests from operators of licensed stations
on the basis of years of operation. Once all station licensees have been afforded an opportunity to request a four-letter
call sign, the opportunity will be extended to LPTV permittees. The certification requirement will effectively
enable the Commission to award four-letter call signs to those permittees most likely to construct and operate their
stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. All LPTV four-letter call signs will include a suffix of ``&hyph;LP,'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``WXYZ&hyph;LP''). We do not agree that the suffix will unduly prejudice LPTV stations, and we believe that such
a suffix is necessary to distinguish LPTV stations from full-power television stations so as to guard against public
confusion. The commenters' comparison of the relationship between LPTV and full-power stations to that of different
types of stations in other broadcast services is inapposite. Different classes of FM stations are all regulated as
part of the FM service, and different classes of AM stations are all regulated under the AM service. LPTV stations,
however, are regulated as a distinct broadcast service from full-power television stations. As such, they are not
constrained to follow rules applicable to full-power stations such as multiple ownership restrictions, children's
programming rules, the prime time access rule, local public file requirements and main studio requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, they operate on a secondary, non-interference basis. We believe that the distinctive suffix ``&hyph;LP''
is more appropriate than ``TV,'' ``CT'' or other suggestions because it best reflects the longstanding denomination
of the service and would not introduce new and possibly confusing terminology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. As we proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, requests for four-letter call signs will be handled under the practices detailed in &sect;73.3550 of the Commission's
Rules.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 An LPTV operator may not request a call sign used by another broadcast station unless the stations are commonly owned,
or unless the LPTV operator has the other station's written consent. Also in keeping with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, where a call sign is requested by more than one party, the first operator to file its request with the Commission will
prevail. In the case of identical requests filed on the same day, the call letters will be assigned to the station with
the longest continuous record of broadcasting operation under substantially unchanged ownership and control.
We also adopt the proposal from commenters that a full-power television station will prevail in the situation where
a full-power station and an LPTV station apply for the same call sign on the same day. Similarly, an AM or FM radio stations
will prevail over an LPTV station applying for the same call sign on the same day.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis for this item as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Need for and Purpose of this Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. This action is taken to relax the Commission's standards regarding acceptance of applications for stations in
the low power television (LPTV) service, and to permit LPTV stations to request four-letter call signs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis_None.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. Significant Alternatives Considered and Rejected
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. The Commission considered a lesser relaxation of the application acceptance standards. The Commission also
considered not allowing LPTV operators to apply for four-letter call signs until after they are licensed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) No request for a new call sign assignment will be accepted from an applicant for a new station until the FCC has granted
a construction permit. Failure by the permittee of a new station to request the assignment of a specific call sign within
30 days of grant of the construction permit will result in the FCC, on its own motion, assigning an appropriate call
sign. All initial construction permits for low power TV stations will be issued with a five-character low power TV
call sign.

In the case of requests for the same call sign being received on the same date at the FCC, the assignment (if otherwise
grantable) will be made to the station having the longest continuous record of broadcasting operation under substantially
unchanged ownership and control. However, involuntary and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
assignments will not be taken into account in determining priority. If a low-power TV operator and an AM, FM or full-power
TV operator apply for the same call sign on the same date at the FCC, the AM, FM or full-power TV operator will prevail.

The provisions of paragraph (h) of this section shall not apply to a licensee requesting a transfer to another frequency
where the existing and new facilities serve substantially the same area (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,

be listed on a Commission public notice as tendered for filing and given file numbers. Those that are not substantially
complete will be returned to the applicant. If it is determined that a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster application
is substantially complete but contains some defect(s) or omission(s), a deficiency letter will be issued affording
the applicant 30 days to correct the defect. If the defect is not corrected within 30 days of the date on the deficiency
letter, the application will be returned with no further opportunity to amend.

are to follow the procedures delineated in &sect;73.3550. Such four-letter call signs shall begin with K or W; stations
West of the Mississippi River will be assigned an initial letter K and stations east of the Mississippi River will be
assigned an initial letter W. The four-letter call sign will be followed by the suffix ``&hyph;LP.'' A party holding
a low power TV construction permit who requests a four-letter call sign must file with that request a certification
that the station has been constructed, that physical construction is underway at the transmitter site or that a firm
equipment order has been placed.

By the Deputy Chief, Private Radio Bureau.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On January 4, 1994, the United States and Canada exchanged Notes that modified the ``Arrangement Between the Department
of Communications of Canada and the Federal Communications Commission of the United States Concerning the use of
the Band 806&hyph;890 MHz along the Canada-United States Border.'' The effect of these modifications was to remove
certain restrictions on land mobile radio operations along the U.S./Canada border that were designed to protect
the operation of certain Canadian UHF television stations. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 modifies Subpart S of Part 90, 47 CFR Part 90, to conform the rules to the modified agreement and to permit land mobile
licensing on the relevant frequencies in the previously restricted areas along the Canadian border. These channels
are immediately available for licensing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. These rule changes will facilitate the construction and operation of additional Private Land Mobile Radio stations
in the Canadian border area. This should result in improved mobile communication service to the public without adversely
affecting any party. As this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not impose new rules on licensees that would adversely affect their substantive rights, we find that notice and
comment procedures are neither necessary nor appropriate.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 To initiate a notice and comment procedure to make these additional channels available for licensing in the relevant
Canadian border area would significantly delay the use of these channels without any countervailing public interest
benefit. Further, because the rule changes relieve a restriction, we also conclude that these changes should become
effective immediately upon publication in the

(5) Applicants requesting authorizations in the frequency bands in the geographical areas listed below shall submit
documentation indicating compliance with the following protection criteria to the indicated Canadian television
station. Protection to Canadian television assignments and allotments is based on the field strength of an interfering
mobile radio signal at the TV station's calculated Grade B contour (64 dBu) not exceeding the TV field strength by more
than 20 dB (i.e., 84 dBu). The field strength of the TV assignment or allotment is calculated using the R6602 [F(50,50)]
propagation curves and any land mobile base station interfering signal is calculated using the R6602 [F(50,10)]
propagation curves at a receiving effective antenna height of 9.1 meters (30 feet). Where the calculated field strength
of the TV assignment or allotment exceeds the Grade B contour value of 64 dBu at the Canada/U.S.A. border, the land mobile
radio signal may not exceed the actual calculated TV field strength at the border by more than 20 dB.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule amends part 591 to adopt a continuous entry bond as an alternative to the single entry bond that
is required to accompany each nonconforming vehicle imported into the United States. Under the alternative, a registered
importer of motor vehicles who imports more than one vehicle can enter vehicles under a continuous bond that covers
an indefinite number of vehicles at a single time up to the value of the bond. The new bond has a ceiling value of $1,000,000,
and is valid for an indefinite period. Conforming amendments are also adopted for part 592. The agency has determined
that immediate action is in the public interest since it has been informed by a Registered Importer that the principal
bonding company that issues single entry bonds has decided to terminate offering them. The agency is also requesting
comments whether NHTSA should make permanent this alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule also deletes the provisions which expired on October 31, 1992 that allowed importation of a
vehicle without the agency of a registered importer if the importer owned the vehicle before October 31, 1988.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the regulatory scheme in effect for the importation of motor vehicles subject to the Federal motor vehicle safety,
bumper, and theft prevention standards, a non-conforming vehicle may be entered under bond in an amount equal to 150
percent of its dutiable value. The purpose of the bond is to assure that the vehicle is subsequently brought into conformance,
or, alternatively, delivered to the U.S. Customs Service for export, or abandoned. The bond covers only one motor
vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Registered Importer (RI) who is an importer of Canadian vehicles for resale asked NHTSA recently for permission
to use a continuous surety bond that would cover more than one motor vehicle. The example given was of a continuous bond
of $150,000 which would cover 10 vehicles imported together, each with a value of $10,000 as determined by the U.S.
Customs Service, instead of 10 individual bonds for 10 vehicles of $10,000 value, each bond set at $15,000. NHTSA replied
(letter of June 4, 1993, to Dan Kokal of Champagne Imports) that it was unable to implement this suggestion without
rulemaking, but that it would consider the feasibility of it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After review of this matter, NHTSA tentatively concluded that the amendment of its regulations to permit an importer
the choice of a continuous entry bond could simplify entry procedures for both government and the private sector,
and would therefore be in the public interest. However, before it could initiate rulemaking, it was informed on April
28, 1994, by another RI, Lawrence A. Beyer, that ``the only bonding company which issues these bonds [has] now advised
me that they no longer wish to issue these bonds.'' According to Mr. Beyer, the effect of this development is that ``[w]ithout
these bonds, registered importers can no longer import. The jobs and livelihood of many people is (sic) at stake.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, NHTSA is amending part 591 to permit a continuous entry bond, as an alternative to the single entry
bond, which has a ceiling of $1,000,000, to minimize the possibility that a registered importer might have to obtain
more than one continuous entry bond. Under the present scheme, Customs ensures that the bond is attached to the HS&hyph;7
importation form, and forwards the documents to NHTSA. Under the alternative, the bond will already be on file at NHTSA.
However, the importer will be required to attach to the HS&hyph;7 importation form a photocopy of the continuous entry
bond and a copy of the Customs Entry Summary (CF 7501) which states the entered value of the vehicle. This information
is necessary to enforce bond forfeiture should that be necessary. The continuous entry bond is simply that shown in
Appendix A with the reference to ``vehicle'' in the singular changed to the plural ``vehicles'' when appropriate.
Because Customs will ensure that a photocopy of the continuous entry bond is attached to the importation form, the
bond processing fee of $4.75 per importation form will continue to apply, but the single fee will cover all vehicles
represented by the single importation form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice also adopts certain housekeeping amendments. Under section 591.6(g), nonconforming vehicles whose
importers met certain specified requirements could be imported before October 31, 1992, without the offices of a
registered importer. As this authority has now expired and will not be renewed, the agency has deleted it, as well as
the bond (Appendix B) which accompanied this type of entry. Conforming amendments are made elsewhere in part 591 as
well.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, a conforming amendment is adopted to the ancillary importation regulation on registered importers, part
592.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule is effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. NHTSA notes that without this amendment to permit a continuous entry bond, RIs and their customers will be unable
to import nonconforming vehicles pursuant to 49 CFR 591.5(f). Therefore, NHTSA finds that the issuance of this notice
without prior opportunity for comment is necessary in view of the difficulties that unexpectedly began to occur recently
and would continue to occur were part 591 not amended. The agency also finds for good cause that it is in the public interest
to establish an immediate effective date for the amendments made by this notice. In the absence of an immediate effective
date, RIs would be unable to continue importing vehicles from Canada and other countries. The amendments impose no
new requirements but instead provides an alternative to an existing requirement, whose continued viability is doubtful.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice was not reviewed under EO 12866. After considering the impacts of this rulemaking action, NHTSA has determined
that the action is not significant within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and
procedures. It amends an existing requirement to afford RIs an alternative method of providing a bond for imported
nonconforming vehicles. The number of RIs affected is less than 20. The cost impacts of this regulatory action are
cost savings to the RIs in procuring bonds (an estimated $20 per vehicle), and nonquantifiable cost savings in the
paper work involved to obtain single-entry bonds. The impacts are so minimal as not to warrant the preparation of a
full regulatory evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also considered the effects of this action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify
that this action would not have a significant economic impact upon ``a substantial number of small entities,'' but
it will have a significant economic impact upon RIs, which number less than 20, and which are small businesses within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This action appears required to allow them to continue in business.
Governmental jurisdictions will not be affected at all since they are generally neither importers nor purchasers
of nonconforming imported motor vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
``Federalism'' and determined that the action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The action will not have a significant
effect upon the environment because it is anticipated that the annual volume of motor vehicles imported will not vary
significantly from that existing before promulgation of the rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor
Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may
not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal
standard. Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing,
amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition
for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Board) is issuing interim final guidelines to
provide additional guidance to the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation in establishing accessibility
standards for new construction and alterations of State and local government facilities covered by title II of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. The guidelines will ensure that newly constructed and altered State
and local government facilities are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities in terms of
architecture, design, and communication. The standards established by the Department of Justice and the Department
of Transportation must be consistent with and may incorporate the guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the provisions for State and local governments, the Board has also made some editorial changes to the
Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines to further clarify the guidelines. These editorial changes
are not substantive.

Statutory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) extends to individuals with disabilities
comprehensive civil rights protections similar to those provided to persons on the basis of race, sex, national origin,
and religion under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II of the ADA, which became effective on January 26, 1992, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability
in services, programs and activities provided by State and local government entities, and the National Railroad
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). Section 202 of the ADA extends the nondiscrimination policy of section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 794) which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability
in Federally assisted programs and activities to all State and local governmental entities regardless of whether
such entities receive Federal funds. Most programs and activities of State and local governments are recipients
of financial assistance from one or more Federal agencies and are already covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Title III of the ADA, which also became effective on January 26, 1992, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability
by private entities who own, lease, lease to, or operate a place of public accommodation. Title III establishes accessibility
requirements for new construction and alterations in places of public accommodation and commercial facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 of the ADA requires that the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Board) issue
minimum guidelines to assist the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation in establishing accessibility
standards under titles II and III. Under sections 204(a) and 306(b) of the ADA, the Department of Justice is responsible
for issuing final regulations, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Board, to implement titles II and III
(except for transportation vehicles and facilities). Sections 229 and 306(a) of the ADA provide that the Department
of Transportation is responsible for issuing regulations to implement the transportation provisions of titles
II and III of the ADA. Those regulations must also be consistent with the Board's guidelines.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 26, 1991, the Board published the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) to assist
the Department of Justice in establishing accessibility standards for new construction and alterations in places
of public accommodation and commercial facilities. See 56 FR 35408, as corrected at 56 FR 38174 (August 12, 1991) and
57 FR 1393 (January 14, 1992), 36 CFR Part 1191. ADAAG contains scoping provisions and technical specifications generally
applicable to buildings and facilities (sections 1 through 4.35) and additional requirements specifically applicable
to certain types of buildings and facilities covered by title III of the ADA: restaurants and cafeterias (section
5); medical care facilities (section 6); mercantile and business facilities (section 7); libraries (section 8);
and transient lodging (section 9).

 On September 6, 1991, the Board amended ADAAG to include additional requirements specifically applicable to transportation
facilities (section 10). See 56 FR 45500, 36 CFR 1191.1. On that same date, the Board also published separate final
guidelines to assist the Department of Transportation in establishing accessibility standards for transportation
vehicles. See 56 FR 45530, 36 CFR Part 1192. The Department of Transportation has incorporated ADAAG and the Board's
guidelines for transportation vehicles and facilities in its final regulations. See 56 FR 45584 (September 6, 1991),
49 CFR Parts 37 and 38.

On July 26, 1991, the Department of Justice published its final regulations implementing title III of the ADA which
incorporated ADAAG as the accessibility standards for newly constructed and altered places of public accommodation
and commercial facilities covered by title III. See 56 FR 35544, 28 CFR Part 36. On that same date, the Department of
Justice published its final regulations implementing title II of the ADA. See 56 FR 35694, 28 CFR Part 35. The Department
of Justice's title II regulations give State and local governments the option of choosing between designing, constructing
or altering their facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)

UFAS was developed by the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, and the United States Postal Service to implement the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.
4151 et seq.) which requires certain Federally financed buildings to be accessible. Most Federal agencies reference
UFAS in the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities constructed or altered by recipients of Federal
financial assistance for purposes of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. (29 U.S.C. 794).

In new construction and alterations, title III of the ADA does not require elevators if a facility is less than three
stories or has less than 3000 square feet per story, unless the facility is a shopping center or mall; a professional
office of a health care provider; or a terminal, depot or other station used for specified public transportation or
an airport passenger terminal. See 28 CFR 36.401(d) and 36.404.

When the Department of Justice published its title II regulations, it noted that the Board would be supplementing
ADAAG in the future to include additional guidelines for State and local government facilities. The Department of
Justice further stated that it anticipated that it would amend its title II regulations to adopt ADAAG as the accessibility
standards for State and local government facilities after the Board supplemented ADAAG. 56 FR 35694, 35711 (July
26, 1991). Adopting essentially the same accessibility standards for titles II and III of the ADA will ensure consistency
and uniformity of design in the public and private sectors throughout the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further the goal of uniform standards, the Board intends to use ADAAG as the accessibility guidelines for Federally
financed facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) since the Federal government
owns or operates many of the same type of facilities as State and local governments which are addressed in this interim
final rule. Under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792), the Board is responsible for establishing
guidelines for accessibility standards issued by other Federal agencies pursuant to the Architectural Barriers
Act of 1968. See note 2 supra. The Board anticipates initiating action to adopt ADAAG with special provisions as appropriate
for Federal buildings (e.g., post offices, military facilities) in place of its current guidelines for Federally
financed facilities. Standards issued by other Federal agencies pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act must
be consistent with the Board's guidelines. Those Federal agencies responsible for issuing accessibility standards
under the Architectural Barriers Act will initiate separate rulemaking to adopt standards consistent with ADAAG
as supplemented in place of UFAS. Commenters, including Federal agencies, were encouraged to comment on the notice
of proposed rulemaking for State and local government facilities in the context of how the proposed guidelines will
also affect Federal facilities and to specify any particular Federal building types which would require special
provisions. A number of the comments received in response to the NPRM supported having a single standard for all facilities,
including State, local and Federal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which proposed to add four special application sections to the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines
specifically applicable to certain types of buildings and facilities covered by title II of the ADA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Judicial, Legislative, and Regulatory Facilities.

14. Public Rights-of-Way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM also proposed requirements and asked questions regarding the addition of miscellaneous provisions specifically
applicable to State and local government facilities, including swimming pools, text telephones, automatic doors,
airport security systems, entrances, elevator exemptions, building signage, assistive listening systems, and
sales and service counters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board held five public hearings in various locations between February 22, 1993 and March 15, 1993. A total of 148
people presented testimony on the proposed guidelines at the hearings. In addition, 447 written comments were submitted
to the Board by the end of the comment period on March 22, 1993. Another 127 comments were received after March 22, 1993.
Although those comments were not timely, the Board considered them to the extent practicable. In all, the Board received
nearly 7000 pages of comments and testimony on the proposed guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board received comments and testimony from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including individuals
who identified themselves as having a disability; organizations representing persons with disabilities; State
or local code administrators; State, local and Federal government agencies; manufacturers; design professionals;
and national professional and trade associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments and testimony were sorted by section and analyzed. A large number of commenters expressed support for
the guidelines as proposed. Some comments requested changes and others requested clarifications. As a result of
the comments, a number of provisions were revised. In particular, ADAAG 14 (Public Rights-of-Way) was extensively
reorganized. With respect to those commenters who recommended changes, a few submitted data or studies in support
of their recommendations. Some commenters asked questions regarding the application of the guidelines to specific
situations. The application of those provisions is discussed in the section-by-section analysis which follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the large number of comments received, it is not possible for the Board to respond to each comment in this preamble.
The Board has made every effort to respond to significant comments in the general issues and section-by-section analysis.
As discussed under general issues and in ADAAG 14 (Public Rights of Way), the Board has reserved action in some areas
pending further study or research. The Board has an on-going research and technical assistance program and plans
to periodically review and up-date the guidelines to ensure that they remain consistent with technological developments
and changes in model codes and national standards, and meet the needs of individuals with disabilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the Board's guidelines provide guidance to the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation
in establishing accessibility standards for new construction and alterations of State and local government facilities
covered by title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. The standards established by the Department
of Justice and the Department of Transportation must be consistent with and may incorporate the guidelines. The Department
of Justice and the Department of Transportation are each publishing notices of proposed rulemaking to incorporate
the Board's guidelines as the standards for State and local government facilities in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The notices published by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation seek comment from the public
on its proposal to incorporate the Board's guidelines. Consistent with the requests by the Department of Justice
and the Department of Transportation for comment on its proposed actions, the Board has chosen to issue these guidelines
as an interim final rule and is also soliciting comment. All three agencies have requested in their notices that comments
on the amendments to ADAAG be forwarded to the Board for consideration. The simultaneous publication of rules and
the coordination of the review process between the three agencies is expected to both facilitate and expedite the
review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In finalizing the guidelines, the Board, the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation will consider
all comments previously received in response to the Board's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for State and local government
facilities published on December 21, 1992, as well as comments received on this interim final rule. Accordingly,
those commenters who have previously responded to the Board's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking need only submit new
comments on the interim final rule.

The NPRM asked whether automatic or power assisted doors should be required at entrances to State and local government
facilities and if so, whether this provision should be limited to specific types of State or local government facilities.
The NPRM also asked for information regarding alternative methods of providing accessibility at exterior doors;
power assisted door activating mechanisms; automatic doors and maneuvering clearances during power failures;
and maximum opening forces.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of commenters supported a requirement for automatic or power assisted doors at entrances. Several commenters
including the National Park Service, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, and the New
York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation supported a requirement for automatic or power
assisted doors as a means for making historic buildings with heavy doors more accessible. Responses varied on whether
the requirement should apply to one primary entrance, or to all doors in State or local government buildings and facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters stated that, rather than requiring automatic or power assisted doors, the Board should establish
technical provisions for acceptable door opening pressure and allow State and local government entities flexibility
in meeting the provision. Commenters suggested that allowing entities the flexibility to choose the means by which
they achieve this door pressure may lead to the development and application of new technology and prevent reliance
on electronic devices. Commenters' views on the location and type of operating mechanisms to be used varied greatly.
Other commenters indicated that there may be security problems with requiring automatic or power assisted doors
for detention and correctional facilities.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently, the Board sponsored a research project to provide recommended scoping and technical provisions for automatic
or power assisted doors applicable to both State and local government facilities and private entities. The Board
has decided not to consider issuing guidelines in this area until the results of the study have been analyzed. The final
report is available from the Board. Currently, State and local government facilities and private entities are encouraged
to exercise the option, consistent with ADAAG 4.13.12 (Automatic Doors and Power Assisted Doors), to use automatic
or power assisted doors to increase accessibility.

Alterations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on comments received in response to the initial rulemaking for ADAAG, the NPRM proposed that ADAAG 4.1.6(2)
apply to facilities subject to title II of the ADA. (See 56 FR 2319, January 22, 1991). ADAAG 4.1.6(2) requires that
where alterations affect or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function, the entity
shall make the alteration in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area
and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area are accessible to the extent that
the costs of these accessibility features are not disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and
scope as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund and a few other commenters requested a change to the path of travel
requirement that would combine the requirements of ADAAG and UFAS. The commenters noted that UFAS 4.1.6(3) contains
minimum accessibility requirements for a building or facility that is substantially altered, regardless of disproportionate
costs. These commenters also noted that the Department of Justice title III regulations provide a list of priorities
that should be followed when choosing which accessible elements to provide in the event of disproportionality. Since
the Department of Justice title II regulations do not contain such a priority list for providing accessible elements,
the commenters requested that the title III priority list be incorporated into ADAAG so that the priorities would
apply to State and local government entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 4.1.6(2), by itself, yields a substantial level of accessibility. The addition of the UFAS provision to the
requirements of ADAAG 4.1.6(2), will not, in most cases, result in greater accessibility than that currently required
by the Department of Justice's title III regulations. Further, incorporating the UFAS provision into ADAAG 4.1.6(2)
would result in a requirement for State and local government entities which is different from the ADAAG requirements
for private entities. The requirements for public and private entities should be uniform unless there is a compelling
reason for them to be different. With regard to setting priorities for accessible elements in the event of disproportionality,
the Department of Justice has proposed to amend its title II regulations to address this and other issues. See 28 CFR
Part 35. Based on these reasons, no changes to the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.6(2) have been made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM asked whether polling places operated by State or local governments utilize fixed voting booths and equipment
and how these fixed voting booths and devices currently meet the accessibility needs of persons with visual impairments,
reach range limitations, and limitations in manipulating or operating controls. In addition, the NPRM requested
information regarding existing and new technologies which would enable people with disabilities to use voting equipment
and booths without assistance. The NPRM also requested comment on the cost information of such technologies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A large number of commenters recommended various means which may be used to make voting booths and equipment accessible.
These include such auxiliary aids as computers, touch tone phone systems, touch screen technology with voice output
through earphones, tactile markings, voting equipment with audio capabilities, and the use of push-button controls
instead of levers. Other suggestions for providing access to the voting process include the use of taped, brailled,
or large print ballots. None of the comments indicated that technology is currently in use to provide independent
access for individuals who are blind. No information was provided regarding the costs associated with the recommended
technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Some commenters noted that access to the voting process could be achieved through absentee balloting procedures.
A large number of commenters pointed out that existing Federal and many State laws allow people who are blind or visually
impaired who need assistance to choose their own personal assistants to help them in the voting process. Several commenters
stressed the importance of an accessible area which surrounds the voting equipment and an accessible route to the
polling place. Only one commenter knew of a jurisdiction which had fixed voting booths. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the degree fixed voting booths are constructed and altered, they are subject to ADAAG requirements. In addition,
as buildings and facilities covered by ADAAG are newly constructed or altered, accessibility will be required in
these buildings and facilities, thereby improving access to polling places which may occupy these buildings or facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although portable booths and equipment would not be covered by the construction and alteration requirements contained
in ADAAG, such portable items and the voting process is subject to the Department of Justice regulations implementing
title II of the ADA. These regulations require program accessibility and auxiliary aids and services (see 28 CFR 35.149
and 35.160).

The NPRM sought comment on the design issues associated with providing integrated and dispersed accessible seating
locations in arenas, stadiums or other sports facilities. In September 1992 the Board initiated a research project
on assembly area accessibility. Through post-occupancy evaluations of sports and performing arts facilities,
the Board is examining numerous issues related to current ADAAG provisions. The Board intends to address issues associated
with assembly areas in a separate rulemaking once this research is completed.

The chart at ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(a) refers to the required number of single wheelchair spaces. ADAAG 4.33.2 (Size of Wheelchair
Locations) references Figure 46 (Space Requirements for Wheelchair Seating Spaces in Series) which illustrates
two wheelchair spaces and specifies the clear floor space required depending on whether a side, rear, or forward approach
is provided. Figure 46 is only illustrative of wheelchair seating spaces in a series and does not require that all wheelchair
locations provide two wheelchair spaces. No changes were made to this provision.

Audible Announcements and Effective Communication for Persons With Hearing Impairments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 10.3.1(14) and 10.4.1(6) (Transit Facilities) require that when transportation facilities provide information
through a public address system, equivalent information be provided to persons who are deaf or hearing impaired.
In the NPRM, a similar requirement was considered for State and local government facilities which also provide audible
announcements to the public. The NPRM sought information on what types of State and local government facilities typically
provide audible announcements to the public and what alternative means are available for providing this information
to persons who are deaf or hearing impaired. Information on the costs of audible systems and alternatives was also
sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters indicated that a broad range of facilities such as public schools, welfare and motor vehicle departments,
correctional and medical facilities, and convention centers often use audible announcements. Commenters from
State and local governments indicated that the use of a system of audible announcements depends on the programs and
services provided, the nature of the information, and the number of people served by the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Self Help for Hard of Hearing People (SHHH), which represents persons with hearing impairments, noted that in order
to determine which announcement system best serves the public, the information being provided must be evaluated
and the methods of communication selected accordingly. Another commenter indicated that it may be necessary to provide
a number of methods to ensure effective communication. Some commenters suggested providing video monitors, electronic
message boards, or tactile pagers as a means of providing equivalent information to persons with hearing impairments.
Commenters suggested that if a provision requiring equivalent information is added to ADAAG, the requirement should
be flexible enough to facilitate compliance with the Department of Justice regulations requiring effective communication
and program access. Little cost data on audible announcement systems and other alternatives was received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments suggested that the nature of the information provided in State and local government facilities differs
from the information provided in transit facilities. In the view of commenters representing State and local governments,
the information provided by the audible announcements in State and local government facilities varies depending
on the programs and services provided and may be primarily directed to the employees, not to the public. On the other
hand, the information provided through the public address system in transit facilities is integral to the use of the
transit system. Audible announcements in transit facilities provide critical information on arrivals, departures,
boarding, destinations, and delays or cancellations. Although commenters recommended various methods for providing
equivalent information to persons with hearing impairments when audible announcements are used, there was no consensus
as to the most effective means of providing such information to the public. Therefore, no ADAAG provision has been
included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA, however, does require State and local government
entities to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, and members of the public with disabilities
are as effective as communications with others, unless the public entity can demonstrate that action would result
in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative
burdens. See 28 CFR 35.160(a) and 35.164.

Assistive Listening Systems

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b) requires permanently installed assistive listening systems to be provided where audible communications
are integral to the use of an assembly area, if the assembly area accommodates at least 50 people or has an audio-amplification
system, and has fixed seating. ADAAG 11.9 requires that permanently installed assistive listening systems be provided
in certain rooms in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities, regardless of the number of persons accommodated
or whether there is an amplification system and fixed seating is provided. The NPRM asked whether there are additional
types of State and local government facilities where requirements for permanently installed assistive listening
systems should be based on the type of room rather than the criteria in ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters responded that assistive listening systems should be provided in educational facilities, large public
waiting rooms, job-applicant testing and professional-licensing testing facilities, gymnasiums and emergency
shelters. Many other commenters recommended that assistive listening systems be provided in all facilities available
to the general public for meetings, hearings and other facilities available for public use. In addition, a few commenters
requested that ADAAG 11.9(2) be clarified so that rooms used for public policy hearings are considered legislative
or regulatory facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A number of commenters stated that the criteria of ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b) should be applied and that no additional requirements
for assistive listening systems are necessary. However, other commenters recommended a change to ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b)
so that assistive listening systems are provided in rooms without fixed seating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Many commenters recommended that portable devices be permitted to allow for more flexibility, less cost and retrofitting.
No supporting documentation on portable systems or cost information was provided.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain rooms and spaces recommended by commenters such as job applicant testing sites and gymnasiums are already
required to provide assistive listening systems if they meet the criteria in ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b). As commenters pointed
out, facilities that do not have fixed seating do not meet these criteria. However, those facilities listed in ADAAG
11.9 are required to provide permanently installed assistive listening systems even if they do not have fixed seating.
Some of those areas recommended by commenters in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities are addressed
in ADAAG 11.9. For example, one of each type of hearing room is required to be equipped with an assistive listening system.
Rooms in other types of facilities are not required to provide assistive listening systems based on the occupancy
or type of room. However, all State and local government entities are subject to the Department of Justice's title
II regulations requiring that programs and services provide effective communications, including auxiliary aids
unless it can be demonstrated that such action would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service,
program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.160(a) and 28 CFR 35.164. To facilitate
the use of portable systems, ADAAG 11.8 requires electrical outlets, wiring, and conduit for communications systems
in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities. No changes were made to ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b).

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM asked questions regarding areas or spaces in State or local government facilities which require protection
from electronic eavesdropping. The NPRM also sought technical options for solving security-related problems and
asked whether one type of system is more secure than another. Commenters were requested to provide cost information
for providing a secure assistive listening system. Finally, the NPRM asked whether any areas should be exempt from
the requirement of an assistive listening system due to risks associated with electronic eavesdropping.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters expressed general concern about assistive listening systems in areas where sensitive communications
require strict security. The commenters provided programmatic and technical solutions including training people
to turn assistive listening systems on or off, installing hard-wired communications systems, constructing soundproof
areas that require security and confidentiality and using computer aided transcription or real-time captioning.
The installation of an infrared listening system which cannot penetrate the confines of a room was a highly recommended
solution. Some commenters noted that since infrared signals can travel through windows, solid window coverings
would be necessary for total confidentiality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Very little cost information was provided. A few commenters stated that the cost of a secure assistive listening system
would vary due to the type of areas or space and the number of transmitters required to serve the space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the view of many commenters, certain spaces such as control centers, armories, legal visiting areas, pharmacies
and medical service areas should be exempt from the assistive listening system requirement due to the risk of electronic
eavesdropping. An equal number of commenters stated that no areas should be exempt because technology is available
that satisfies the accessibility requirement and provides protection from electronic eavesdropping. Several
commenters noted that legislatures and similar types of facilities employ safeguards such as monitoring hallways
and establishing procedures for checking out receiver units to ensure that electronic eavesdropping does not take
place. One commenter pointed out that equipment unrelated to assistive listening devices is readily available to
persons wishing to eavesdrop.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed reference to a State or local government entity, as well as the existing reference to a place of public
accommodation or commercial facility, has been deleted from the definition of an alteration. This definition now
applies to any facility covered by ADAAG. An alteration is defined as a change to a building or facility that affects
or could affect its usability. Normal maintenance, cosmetic changes, or changes to mechanical systems are not alterations
unless they affect the usability of the building or facility. New language has been added to the definition to clarify
that alterations include changes to pedestrian facilities within the public right-of-way. Such changes may include,
but are not limited to, the alteration or reconstruction of pedestrian routes, or the addition of street furniture,
landscaping, or other fixed elements along a pedestrian route. These changes were added to be consistent with the
addition of ADAAG 14 (Public Rights-of-Way). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original preamble to ADAAG stated: ``If a parking lot is resurfaced and does not have the number of accessible parking
spaces required by 4.1.2(5) or the parking spaces do not comply with 4.6.3, those requirements must be met with unless
it is technically infeasible.'' See 56 FR 144 at 35427. The addition of the word resurfacing to this definition is not
intended as a new interpretation of what constitutes an alteration, but rather to reinforce the original intent that
the resurfacing of streets, sidewalks, parking lots, and other outdoor surfaces is considered an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although commenters generally supported the application of the alteration definition to State and local government
entities, several commenters requested that language be added in ADAAG ``stating that usability is to be interpreted
broadly''. The preamble to the Department of Justice's title III regulation states that: ``The Department remains
convinced that the Act requires the concept of `usability' to be read broadly to include any change that affects the
usability of the facility, not simply changes that relate directly to access by individuals with disabilities.''

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the NPRM, the words ``one or more dwelling units'' were deleted from the ADAAG definition for transient lodging
because ``dwelling unit'' only refers to residential facilities covered in ADAAG 13. Transient lodging includes
facilities used on a transient basis and excludes residential facilities or medical care facilities. Resorts, hotels,
motels, and dormitories used on a transient basis are examples of transient lodging. Some commenters requested that
the guidelines distinguish between the terms transient lodging and dwelling unit.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of dwelling unit in ADAAG 3.5 has been deleted to reduce confusion and a new definition of dwelling unit
has been added at ADAAG 13.1(1). For clarification of the term dwelling unit, see ADAAG 13.1. As proposed in the NPRM,
the definition of transient lodging has been changed to clarify that a transient lodging facility is not considered
a residential facility. With respect to the operation of certain types of facilities, either ADAAG 9 (Accessible
Transient Lodging) or ADAAG 13 (Accessible Residential Housing), or both, may be applicable. An appendix note has
been added to clarify that the Department of Justice's policy and rules will further define what is covered as transient
lodging.

ADAAG 4.1.1(5)(b), as revised, exempts from the requirements for accessibility prison guard towers, fire towers,

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked for comment on the basis or rationale for any recommended exception. There was no clear consensus among
commenters responding to this question. Recommendations were made for exceptions based on the nature, use, or size
of the facility, the cost of providing accessibility, occupancy load, and the safety and security of occupants. Some
commenters, including several disability organizations, noted that certain facilities may merit exemption. For
example, the Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund, stated that ``very small occupancy facilities *&blank;*&blank;*
which house only one or two persons could be treated differently (possibly exempted).'' Several commenters, however,
cautioned that any exception should be carefully and specifically written so as not to be interpreted more broadly
than was intended. A few comments suggested that exceptions list specific facilities and structures while others
recommended exceptions that would allow facilities to be considered for exception on a case-by-case basis. Some
comments urged that no further exception be provided.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Exceptions that list specific facilities are more easily interpreted than exceptions stated in general terms. However,
exceptions based on specific facilities may exclude other facilities of a more unique nature that were not noted in
comments or considered during rulemaking. Consequently, exceptions have been provided in ADAAG 4.1.1(5) (General
Exceptions) according to the structural limitations that make accessibility infeasible. These exceptions contain
examples of specific facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prison operators and corrections officials recommended that prison guard towers and other raised security posts
be exempt. In addition, it was recommended that access not be required to upper level prison cells where multi-tier
housing is provided since elevator and other confined spaces present security risks.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prison guard towers and other elevated security areas are similar in nature and use to ``observation galleries used
primarily for security purposes'' currently exempt in ADAAG 4.1.1(5)(b)(i) and have been incorporated into this
exception. With respect to upper level prison cells, ADAAG 12 (Detention and Correctional Facilities) requires
that only a percentage of prison cells be accessible. An accessible route is not required to all cells, including those
that may be located on upper tiers accessed only by stairs. See ADAAG 12.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked whether design solutions are available for making certain structures accessible such as fire towers
and fixed life guard stands. These facilities are typically not considered to be ``multi-story'' according to building
codes or the definition of ``story'' in ADAAG 3.5 (Definitions) and thus are not subject to the requirement in ADAAG
4.1.3(5) for a passenger elevator. However, such facilities are otherwise subject to the requirements for accessibility,
including the requirement for an accessible route in ADAAG 4.1.3(1). Ramps and, in some cases platform lifts, may
be part of an accessible route. A majority of commenters recommended that fire towers and life guard stands be exempt
due to the lack of design solutions to provide access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The standard design and elevation of fire towers typically prohibit installation of a ramp or elevator in accordance
with appropriate local or State building codes. Similarly, fixed life guard stands by their design and construction
cannot easily sustain platform lifts or ramps. The exception in ADAAG 4.1.1(5)(b)(i) which addresses ``raised areas
used primarily for purposes of security'' has been revised to cover those areas that are raised for purposes of life
or fire safety, such as fire towers and fixed life guard towers which are listed in this provision as examples.

 ADAAG 4.1.1(5)(b)(ii) exempted ``non-occupiable spaces accessed only by ladders, catwalks crawl spaces, very
narrow passageways, or freight (non-passenger) elevators, and frequented only by service personnel for repair
purposes.'' Commenters recommended that this exception be revised to address certain limited use utility facilities
often found in the public sector. Such facilities include water and sewage treatment pump rooms and stations, electric
substations, transformer vaults, and highway and tunnel utility facilities. These facilities do not qualify for
the existing exception because they may be frequented not only for repair purposes but for maintenance and monitoring
of equipment as well. Further, some of these facilities may be accessed by tunnels instead of ladders, catwalks, crawl
spaces, very narrow passageways, or freight elevators.

 The NPRM asked whether design solutions exist for providing access to toll booths. The response to this question was
mixed. Several commenters indicated that toll booths are currently required to be accessible in the State of California.
In addition, the Institutional and Municipal Parking Congress noted that cashier booths, such as those found in large
parking facilities, are ``virtually indistinguishable'' from toll booths, and have been made accessible according
to ADAAG. However, other commenters noted that some toll booths are accessed from below through underground tunnels
so that toll booth operators need not cross vehicular traffic. While access is considered feasible from grade level,
access from tunnels or passageways below grade would be difficult according to existing toll booth design. Some State
transportation departments noted that requiring grade-level access would compromise employee safety.

 An exception has been provided in ADAAG 4.1.1(5)(b)(iii) for single occupant structures accessed only by passageways

ADAAG 4.1.3(5) contains exceptions from the requirement for a passenger elevator in certain facilities and circumstances.
Exception 1 has been modified to address State and local government facilities that are less than three stories and
not open to the public where the floor above the accessible ground floor houses no more than five persons and is less
than 500 square feet. In addition, an exception to the requirement that elevators serve each level of multi-story
buildings is provided for at air traffic control towers. Under Exception 5, elevator access is not required to serve
the cab and the floor immediately below the cab since an elevator serving such levels would obstruct the required 360
degree clear view. While commenters noted that lifts may provide a feasible alternative means of access to these levels,
the Board wishes to further assess the impact a requirement for vertical access, such as a platform lift complying
with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts), would have on these facilities. Under NFPA 1010_1991 Life Safety Code section 30&hyph;2.4.1,
air traffic control towers are required to provide only one means of egress. According to the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), a vertical means of access to the cab will require the provision of a second means of egress from the cab to the
ground level of the tower. Since air traffic control towers are typically built or operated by the FAA, a Federal entity,
the Board plans to further consider this issue during adoption of ADAAG as the accessibility guideline for Federally
financed facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title III of the ADA states that elevators are not required in facilities that are less than three stories or that have
less than 3000 square feet per story unless the building is a shopping center or mall, the professional office of a health
care provider, or another type of facility as determined by the Attorney General. Title II of the ADA does not specify
a similar exception for State and local government facilities. The NPRM asked whether an exemption from the requirement
for an elevator based on the presumed physical abilities of occupants is justified for certain State and local government
facilities, such as firehouses with upper floors that are used only by firefighters.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of commenters opposed an elevator exception based on the presumed physical capabilities of employees
or other occupants of the facility. Most of these commenters argued that such an exception would limit the employment
opportunities of persons with disabilities. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces
title I of the ADA, stated that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of the ADA stresses a case-by-case determination of whether an individual with a disability can perform the
essential functions of the job. Myths, fears, and stereotypes about disability are irrelevant to this determination.
Consistent with this premise, blanket exclusions of individuals based on disability will be closely scrutinized
under Title I of the ADA and in most cases, will probably be struck down as discriminatory *&blank;*&blank;* As a practical
matter, a case-by-case determination of whether an individual with a disability can perform the essential functions
of a job with reasonable accommodation will be moot if the employer can show that providing the reasonable accommodation
will impose an undue hardship. While it will always depend on the particulars of the case, where certain levels of accessibility
are not built in at the design stage of new construction, an employer is more likely to be able to prove an undue hardship
defense based upon the need to make significant structural changes to the relevant work area.

Some commenters also noted that exemptions based on physical qualifications of facility occupants or employees
can be confusing or difficult to interpret. Several commenters argued against such an exception because the occupancy
of a facility may change or because access may be needed by other persons, such as supervisory personnel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exceptions based on essential job requirements may not only be inconsistent with the ADA, as noted by the EEOC, but
are also inconsistent with existing ADAAG provisions applicable to public accommodations and commercial facilities
in the private sector. While full accessibility is not required in employee work areas, ADAAG 4.1.3 does require in
section 4.1.1(3) access so that persons with disabilities can ``approach, enter, and exit'' such areas. Neither
this provision nor existing ADAAG exceptions exempt accessibility based on the physical capabilities of employees
or occupants. Exceptions based on structural factors or limitations are more consistent with ADAAG and the ADA. Thus,
the NPRM asked whether design solutions exist for providing access to certain multi-story facilities where installation
of an elevator may be infeasible or impractical. Examples include drawbridge and boat traffic towers, lock and dam
control stations, and air traffic control towers, which require a clear 360 degree view that cannot be obstructed
by an elevator shaft.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters identified lifts, including vertical and incline lifts, as feasible alternatives to elevators,
particularly with respect to air traffic control towers. The response concerning drawbridge and boat traffic towers
and lock and dam control stations was less conclusive, although a slight majority recommended that such facilities
not be exempt. Several other comments noted that limited use or limited access elevators may provide a solution since
they require less space than do passenger elevators meeting the requirements of ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators). Other comments
considered available solutions as cost prohibitive or impractical and recommended further study.

Existing exceptions in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) allow the use of platform lifts complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts)
in lieu of an elevator in limited circumstances, such as ``incidental spaces and rooms which are not open to the general
public and which house no more than five persons'' or ``where existing site constraints or other constraints make
use of a ramp or elevator infeasible.'' (See Exception 4(c) and (d)). While platform lifts may be an effective solution
in addressing changes in level of a certain distance, their use in providing access between floors may not always be
feasible. For example, platform lifts complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts) must meet the ASME A17.1 Safety
Code for Elevators and Escalators, Section XX, 1990, which prohibits vertical wheelchair lifts from traveling more
than twelve feet or from penetrating floors (Rule 2000.7a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing exception for facilities subject to title III of the ADA that are less than three stories or that have less
than 3000 square feet per story is contained in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) Exception 1. As noted in the NPRM, the applicability
of this exception to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities was clarified. In addition, as part
of this rulemaking, this provision has been lettered (a). An exception has been added in Exception 1, paragraph (b)
for facilities subject to title II of the ADA. This exemption is narrower in scope than the existing exception for title
III facilities in paragraph (a) and applies only to facilities that are less than three stories and not open to the general
public where the floor above the accessible ground floor houses no more than five persons and is less than 500 square
feet. Examples include drawbridge towers, boat traffic towers, lock and dam control stations, and train dispatching
towers. The maximum occupancy of five persons is derived from ADAAG 4.1.3(5) Exception 4(c) which allows the use of
a platform lift instead of an elevator in providing access to incidental occupiable spaces. Since a platform lift
may not always be a feasible alternative to an elevator in providing access between floors, Exception 1(b) does not
contain a requirement for platform lifts in exempting elevator access. The 500 square foot maximum is based on a floor
area allowance of 100 square feet per occupant, which is consistent with model building code requirements for business
and industrial occupancies used in determining the occupant load for purposes of egress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, an exemption is provided for air traffic control towers in Exception 5. Under this exception, elevator
access is not required to serve the cab of air traffic control towers since an elevator serving the cab would obstruct
the necessary 360 degree clear view. This exception also applies to the floor immediately below the cab since the machinery
above the elevator may obstruct the 360 degree clear view required in the cab. However, with respect to the floor immediately
below the cab, this exception applies only where maintenance of the 360 degree clear view is not feasible. For example,
a hydraulic elevator, which may be used in air traffic control towers up to a certain height, will enable an elevator
car to serve the floor immediately below the cab without obstructing the 360 degree clear view in the cab. Thus, the
exemption from elevator access to the floor immediately below the cab applies only to those air traffic control towers
that cannot accommodate a hydraulic elevator. While relieved of the requirement for elevator access to the cab and
possibly the floor immediately below the cab, air traffic control towers must be designed to be adaptable under this
exception so that an accessible vertical means of access, such as a platform lift complying with ADAAG 11 (Platform
Lifts), can be installed after construction as an adaptable feature when needed by a person with a disability to serve
the cab and, where necessary, the floor immediately below the cab.

Facilities) and ADAAG 13 (Accessible Residential Housing), this exception has been revised to allow platform lifts
or wheelchair lifts to provide access to raised judges' benches, clerks' stations, speakers' rostrums, and raised
daises, jury boxes and witness stands and to connect levels within an individual dwelling unit.

ADAAG 4.1.3(8) requires that, at a minimum, 50 percent of all public entrances be accessible. In addition, where provided,
one direct entrance to an enclosed parking garage and one entrance to a pedestrian tunnel or elevated walkway, must
be accessible. The provision also states that, ``where feasible, accessible entrances shall be those used by the
majority of the people visiting or working in the building'' (i.e., a principal entrance). The interim final guidelines
provide that facilities subject to title II of the ADA must include all principal public entrances when meeting this
requirement. This provision does not require that the number of accessible entrances exceed 50 percent of all public
entrances or require an increase in the total number of principal public entrances planned for a facility. ADAAG 3.5
(Definitions) defines principal public entrances as any public entrance to a building or facility which is designed
and constructed to accommodate a substantial flow of pedestrian traffic to a major function in the facility. For example,
entrances of facilities subject to title II of the ADA which are designed to be heavily used by the public and connect
exterior facilities with interior amenities and services must be included in the calculation of accessible entrances.
This definition includes criteria to consider when determining which entrances are principal public entrances.

The guidelines define a ``principal public entrance'' as any public entrance to a building or facility which is designed
and constructed to accommodate a substantial flow of pedestrian traffic to a major function of the facility. For example,
an entrance with multiple doorways is generally intended to accommodate a greater flow of pedestrian traffic. The
definition also provides criteria for distinguishing principal public entrances from other entrances (e.g., the
embellishment of an entryway, the size of the doorway or any other design strategy which would make one entrance stand
out prominently from another entrance).

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM presented eight options for requiring accessible entrances in facilities which are subject to title II of
the ADA. The options ranged from no additional requirements to the existing ADAAG to requiring all entrances to be
accessible. The NPRM sought comment on these options and asked that commenters state their preference and justification
for a particular option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments favored some modification of ADAAG for State and local governments. State and local government
agencies and code officials favored options one and two, which are described below. Organizations representing
persons with disabilities and State and local government agencies representing persons with disabilities favored
options six and eight, which are described below. Design professionals and national professional organizations
were divided between these two groups of options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option one was to retain the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(8) as written without any additional requirements for principal
entrances. Commenters supporting option one were concerned that providing additional accessible principal entrances
would result in problems with site constraints (e.g. sloping streets in urban areas) and increase construction costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option two required that at least one principal entrance must be among those entrances required to be accessible by
ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Commenters supporting this option acknowledged the importance of at least one accessible principal
entrance. These commenters favored this option because it also allowed for greater design flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option six required all principal entrances to be accessible and allowed those principal entrances to be counted
toward satisfying the requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Commenters supporting this option stated that relegating
persons with disabilities to the ``side'', ``back'', or even basement entries does not afford them the same choice
in accessing a building as other individuals, and that the use of these other entrances might force them to use a long
and isolated route to gain entry to a building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option eight required that all entrances be accessible. Commenters supporting this option considered it to be the
best option to satisfy the intent of the legislation to stop discrimination against persons with disabilities while
at the same time improving emergency egress. However, other commenters stated that this option would create difficult
design problems when constructing new facilities on existing sites with steep terrain or restricted boundaries.
Additionally, commenters pointed out that to require more public entrances to be accessible would decrease the design
flexibility in constructing a facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has adopted option six which requires facilities subject to title II of the ADA to include all principal public
entrances when meeting the 50% requirement for accessible entrances in ADAAG 4.1.3(8)(a)(i). This option provides
greater assurance that persons with disabilities will have access to the ``front'' entrance and may prevent excessive
travel distances along isolated routes. The provision does not require an increase in the number of entrances planned
for a facility. The number of planned entrances will be determined by the design of the facility. For example, if a new
facility is planned with four principal public entrances, then ADAAG 4.1.3(8)(a)(i) would require only two of the
four principal public entrances to be accessible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would be unreasonable to require all entrances to be accessible in cases where new construction, within existing
urban areas, had to contend with existing slopes and other site considerations, such as existing sidewalks and nearby
property lines. 56 FR 35419. The legislative history makes clear that not every feature of every building needs to
be accessible but rather a high level of convenient access is contemplated. H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt.2, at 118. ADAAG
&sect;4.1.1(5)(a) describes the conditions when structural impracticability due to terrain would prevent full
compliance with requirements for accessibility. Structural impracticability is a very narrow exception and, as
explained in the legislative history, does not apply to situations where a building is constructed on ``hilly'' terrain
or on a plot of land with steep slopes. H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt.2, at 120. This provision will provide a greater level
of convenient access as contemplated in the legislative history.

buildings.

 The NPRM proposed guidelines for restricted and secured entrances in judicial, legislative, and regulatory facilities,
and in detention and correctional facilities. The NPRM asked whether there were other types of State and local government
facilities which have restricted and secured entrances, and if so, whether the guidelines should require that one
or more of the restricted or secured entrances in those facilities be accessible. The NPRM also requested information
on the cost impact of such a requirement. Commenters recommended several facilities where restricted and secured
entrances should be accessible such as colleges, universities, museums, libraries, performing areas in auditoriums,
laboratories in research facilities, police stations, social service offices, and National Guard weapons storage
areas.

 The restricted and secured entrances of the facilities recommended by the commenters generally are public entrances
already covered by ADAAG 4.1.3(8) (Entrances) and are addressed by existing requirements for accessibility. Additionally,
some of the commenters were referring to interior doors and accessible routes, not exterior entrances covered by
this section. The interim final rule contains appendix language recommending that accessible entrances be distributed
among all types of entrances. Additional appendix material has been included to clarify some of the different types
of entrances that should be considered. Specific requirements for restricted and secured entrances are addressed
in ADAAG 11.5 (Restricted and Secured Entrances).

 The NPRM asked whether the guidelines should include a distribution requirement for accessible entrances and, if
so, should such a provision require that an accessible entrance be located on each side of the building where entrances
are provided. The NPRM suggested a requirement based on criteria such as proximity to elevators, information centers
or public streets, and asked whether a distribution requirement should apply only to buildings above a certain size.
Finally, the NPRM asked whether such a distribution provision should apply to all types of State and local government
facilities and what additional cost, if any, would be associated with such a requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were divided on the question of whether a distribution requirement should be added to the guidelines.
Several of the commenters favoring a distribution provision stated that accessible entrances should be provided
on each side of a building where entrances are provided. Some commenters stated that accessible entrances should
be provided close to exterior facilities and building amenities and services. Other commenters stated that the function
and occupancy of a building should be the determining factors in the location of accessible entrances, and that architectural
programming should be used to determine those locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters stated that size should not be a determining factor for such a requirement and that any requirement
for distribution should apply to all State and local government facilities. Very few commenters offered specific
criteria for determining the minimum size of a building to be included in such a provision.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ADAAG 4.3.2 (Accessible Route: Location) currently requires that an accessible route connect public transportation
stops, parking, passenger loading zones, public streets and public sidewalks to an accessible entrance and accessible
spaces within a building. ADAAG 4.6.2 (Parking and Passenger Loading Zones: Location) requires that parking spaces
be located closest to an accessible entrance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous variables must be considered when establishing a distribution requirement. These variables include:
the size of the building, planned entrances on more than one side of the building, the distance between accessible
entrances, the distance from entrances to exterior facilities, and the distance from entrances to interior amenities
and services. The provision for principal public entrances may achieve distribution of accessible entrances around
large buildings with multiple entrances. Appendix language has been added recommending that accessible entrances
be included on each side of a facility where entrances are planned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked whether State and local government facilities should be required to provide tactile or audible directories,
audible signs, or other wayfinding devices for persons with vision impairments. Comment was sought on the types of
facilities that should provide such directories and signs. Additionally, cost information and information about
the reliability of currently available technologies was sought. The majority of commenters supported providing
equal access to information about the accessible services, activities and facilities for persons with vision impairments.
However, there was no clear consensus on the best means of achieving access. Numerous commenters, including individuals
with vision impairments and sign manufacturers, considered tactile directories impractical. Commenters noted
that although audible directories and audible signs for wayfinding may be viable options, there may be capital and
maintenance costs associated with this technology. Commenters raised concerns regarding vandalism, maintenance,
and updating temporary information, as well as the time required to read tactile directories. Very little cost data
was received. Some manufacturers and researchers responded that the technology for providing effective communication
is available and it has many applications such as listing stations in new transportation facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of commenters suggested that alternatives to requiring audible or tactile directories such as providing
a fully staffed information or security desk, a telephone in lieu of an accessible directory, and a hand-held Braille
directory should be included in the guidelines. Commenters representing State and local governments, local organizations
representing people with disabilities, and design professionals suggested that establishing a performance standard
for providing effective communication would provide greater flexibility. In their view, a performance standard
would permit a number of options to be considered depending on the type, level of public access to, and use of buildings
and facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a number of groups representing persons with vision impairments suggested that no further requirements
should be added. They commented that merely asking directions was the most efficient and convenient means of obtaining
needed information for both blind and sighted individuals.

 Although commenters favored various options which may have the potential for providing effective communication,
no provisions for audible directories, audible signs or other wayfinding devices are included at this time. The Department
of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA require State and local governments to ensure that persons
with vision impairments can obtain information about the existence and location of accessible services, activities,
and facilities unless it can be demonstrated that such action would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature
of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.163(a) and 28 CFR

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked about individuals' experiences with raised and incised characters on tactile signs. An overwhelming
majority of commenters, including signage manufacturers, stated that raised characters are more readable than
incised characters and the guidelines should not be revised to include a provision permitting incised characters.
Persons with vision impairments stated that incised characters are very difficult to read. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Foundation for the Blind was concerned that changes to the technical requirements for tactile signage
were being contemplated solely on the basis that raised characters, as opposed to incised, may be more costly. In the
view of designers, certain manufacturers, State and local governments, and persons with vision impairments, the
technical requirements for tactile signage should be based on the readability of signs. A commenter representing
the engraving industry encouraged the Board to sponsor further research to evaluate appropriate technical specifications
for incised characters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM also asked questions regarding the impact of current ADAAG requirements on engraving businesses that primarily
manufacture building signage. Comments from industry representatives indicated that the technologies for producing
tactile signs are readily available and that the acquisition costs are not prohibitive, even for small to medium-sized
business. A number of manufacturers pointed out that they could supplement or modify existing equipment to produce
tactile signs for $50 to $2000, and that minimal training was required. With respect to the signs, one commenter estimated
that the costs of certain custom tactile signs with raised characters could equal or double the cost of the same sign
with incised characters. Building owners and design professionals commented that signs with incised characters
are more difficult to maintain than signs with raised characters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments received confirm that incised characters are not generally readable and therefore do not provide an acceptable
level of accessibility. Additionally, sign manufacturers indicated that they incurred little financial hardship
in retrofitting equipment to produce raised rather than incised character signs. Although certain custom signs
may cost more, the cost of most signs with raised characters is sufficiently comparable to the cost of signs with incised
characters. No change to the technical provisions for tactile signage have been made.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Justice issued technical assistance letters stating that the only signs subject to the tactile
sign requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(16)(a) are room numbers, exit signs, and signs designating men's and women's rooms
and locker rooms containing men's and women's rooms. In light of this interpretation, the NPRM asked whether State
and local government facilities should be required to provide tactile signs when signs are provided which give information
about the function or use of a room or space. A few commenters suggested that all building signs should be tactile to
ensure unassisted access to buildings and facilities. Many commenters requested that a sign such as ``Courtroom''
also be required to be tactile even when it does not include a room number. The Awards and Recognition Association,
which represents members of the engraving industry, commented that a tactile room number, alone, is of little use
unless one has prior knowledge of the room's function. A number of commenters stated that they interpreted ADAAG 4.1.3(16)(a)
to require that signs be tactile even if only a name or single character, such as ``A'', is the designation of a permanent
room or space. In their view, permanent rooms and spaces often are designated by names, in which case, these signs are
required to be tactile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters urged that the scope of the tactile provisions not be expanded to cover signs, or portions of signs,
which provide information about a room's function. They responded that information about room function is ancillary
to room designation, and therefore should not be required to be tactile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments from design professionals, trade associations, sign manufacturers, and organizations representing
persons with vision impairments strongly urged that the signage requirements covering title II and title III entities
be the same.

 Commenters interpreted ADAAG to require tactile signs even where permanent signs use only characters (names or letters)
to designate a permanent room or space. The current scoping language in ADAAG 4.1.2(7) and 4.1.3(16)(a) require that
those permanent rooms or spaces that are designated by permanent signs comply with the technical provisions in ADAAG
4.30.1 and 4.30.4 through 4.30.6 for raised and Brailled characters, finish and contrast, and mounting height and
location. No changes have been made to the scoping requirements in this section of ADAAG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments received in this rulemaking, the Department of Justice has reconsidered its policy regarding
tactile signs, particularly whether to include room names in addition to room numbers, exit signs, and signs designating
men's and women's rooms and locker rooms containing men's and women's rooms. Because the NPRM addressed entities
covered by title II, the Department of Justice plans to include room names for title II facilities. The Department
of Justice will consider amending its title III policy to apply the broader interpretation to title III facilities
in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM proposed that at least one interior public TTY be provided in the public areas of judicial, legislative and
regulatory facilities, and in detention and correctional facilities, if one interior public pay telephone is available.
The NPRM asked whether these provisions were adequate to address the need for public TTYs in these facilities. Information
on the cost impact of these requirements was also requested. A large number of commenters supported the proposed provisions
for TTYs in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities and in detention and correctional facilities. Several
commenters requested that each level of security in correctional and detention facilities having a pay telephone,
be equipped with a TTY. A few commenters regarded the proposed provisions as too restrictive and inflexible, citing
high costs and problems such as TTY equipment being used as weapons in secured areas. Numerous commenters stated that
portable TTYs should be permitted. Commenters noted that permanent pay TTYs are now accessible, secure, and vandal
resistant. Commenters reported that the cost for portable and permanently installed pay TTYs ranges from $239 to
$995.

Several comments were received regarding ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(d) which was referenced in the NPRM. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(d)
requires that interior phone banks with three or more public pay telephones must have at least one phone that is equipped
with a shelf and outlet for use of a portable TTY. The NPRM proposed to exempt secured areas in detention and correctional
facilities from the requirement for outlets and shelves due to security reasons. A few commenters asked that the exemption
be limited to outlets but not to shelves, and two other commenters requested that both an outlet and shelf be required
to accommodate portable TTYs.

ADAAG 4.31.9(3) includes a provision for equivalent facilitation which permits the use of portable devices, in lieu
of permanently installed public TTYs, if the portable device is readily available to users. This provision ensures
equal access, and allows the entity greater flexibility in selecting a secure and cost effective method of providing
access. The exemption for secured areas from the requirement of shelves and outlets has been retained since a detached
shelf and an electrical outlet may be security hazards in detention and correctional facilities.

The NPRM asked whether the existing scoping requirements for TTYs in ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(ii) which covers stadiums,
arenas, convention centers, hotels with a convention center and covered malls, and ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(iii) which
covers emergency, recovery and waiting rooms in hospitals, are sufficient with respect to TTYs in State and local
government facilities. Commenters generally supported the existing ADAAG requirements for State and local government
facilities. Other commenters stated that the requirement would be sufficient if a TTY is also required on each floor
level that has public pay telephones. A few commenters stated that ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c) (ii) and (iii) are too restrictive
for State and local government facilities. Commenters did not suggest any alternative scoping requirements or provide
justification data for alternative scoping. A few commenters asked that the rule clarify whether stadiums, arenas,
convention centers, hotels with a convention center, covered malls, areas serving a hospital emergency room, a hospital
recovery room or a hospital waiting room which are owned or operated by State or local government entities are subject
to the same requirements as the facilities of private entities.

TTY on each floor level having a public pay telephone shall be provided. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(iii) requires that if
a public pay telephone is provided at areas serving hospital emergency, recovery or waiting rooms, then at least one

The NPRM asked whether there are other specific State and local government buildings which should be required to have
a public TTY. The NPRM also asked whether all State and local government facilities should be required to provide a
public TTY if an interior public pay telephone is available. Over half of the commenters requested that public facilities
be equipped with a public TTY whenever a public pay telephone is available. Several commenters recommended that each
floor and/or pay phone location be equipped with a public TTY. A few commenters requested that a public TTY be required
in schools, dormitories, student unions, libraries and State archives. Many of these commenters expressed concern
that there is a greater need for telecommunication access in the public sector than in the private sector because public
entities are frequented on a daily basis by the general public. Some of the commenters noted that public TTY technology
has recently improved and is now available at a much lower cost. Commenters reported similar improvements for portable
TTYs.

Over half of the commenters requested that public TTYs be provided in all State and local government facilities. Without
a public TTY, an individual with a hearing impairment or speech impairment, would not be able to make the important
calls others make from public telephones in State and local government facilities. The intent of the Americans with
Disabilities Act is to provide the accessibility necessary to enable every individual to be independent. For these
reasons, a requirement has been added to ADAAG at 4.1.3(17)(c)(iv) that at least one interior public TTY be provided
in a public use area of a State or local government facility when an interior public telephone is provided in a public
use area of that facility.

The NPRM asked whether the scoping for public TTYs should take into account the size of buildings or facilities. Some
commenters suggested that scoping be based on the size of the facility, but others stated that scoping should take
building occupancy, quantity and dispersion of public telephones, or program accessibility into account. The various
suggestions included providing public TTYs at a ratio of 1 per 4 telephones, or one per each 1,000 building occupants,
whichever is greater; providing public TTYs at a ratio of 1 per 3 telephones; and requiring at least 10 percent of all
public telephones, but not less than one to be equipped with a TTY. A number of commenters requested that directional
signage for public TTYs be required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters' recommendations varied as to which factors should be taken into account to determine scoping. Therefore,
no provisions based on building or facility size have been included. Directional signage is required by ADAAG 4.30.7(3).
Although commenters recommended that scoping provisions be based on program access, the guidelines do not address
program access, but only new construction and alterations of buildings and facilities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision requires at least one means of access into the water in swimming pools covered by title II of the ADA if
such swimming pools are intended for recreational purposes and are not intended solely for diving or wading.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM asked whether guidelines should require access into swimming pools subject to title II of the ADA. Also, the
NPRM asked whether there is a single means of access into swimming pools that would be usable by a range of individuals
with disabilities. If such a single means does not exist, the NPRM asked whether more than one means of access should
be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters stated that ADAAG should require access into swimming pools subject to title II of the
ADA. Local jurisdictions and several States (Oregon, California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts) indicated that
they require access into swimming pools. Other commenters supporting such a provision noted that the technology
for providing access into swimming pools is currently available and is being used by individuals with disabilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters varied greatly on what means of access into swimming pools should be required. Most maintained that there
is no single means of access that meets the needs of a range of individuals with disabilities. Some commenters recommended
that swimming pools have permanently-installed manual lifts, wide stairs, low risers, and handrails. Other commenters
recommended pool ramps and pool lifts, stairs with raised transfer platforms, broad-stepped areas, zero-grade
entry, moveable floors, and raised pool copings with grab bars. While some commenters favored requiring more than
one means of access into a swimming pool, others favored a provision requiring a single means of access, but allowing
for flexibility in determining the specific means. Commenters from State and local governments along with groups
representing individuals with disabilities expressed the need to ensure ``independent'' access when requiring
a means of access into the water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of commenters supported the need to require access into swimming pools. A provision has been added which
requires that a means of access be provided for those swimming pools subject to title II of the ADA. This provision applies
to pools which are intended for recreational purposes and not designed solely for diving or wading. This application
is consistent with certain definitions contained in ANSI-NSPI-1 1991 (American National Standard for Public Swimming
Pools) and therefore does not include diving and wading pools, spas, and therapy tanks. These and other types of facilities
will be considered in future rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While commenters addressed the need to ensure ``independent'' access into the water, this has not been included in
the provision since many of the currently available means of access cannot be used independently by all persons with
disabilities. For example, some pool lifts must be operated by an attendant due to the location of controls or because
the lift is not permanently installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific technical provisions regarding the means of access are not included. This will allow covered entities flexibility
to determine which means is most appropriate based on the specific design and use of the swimming pool. Additionally,
the Board has established a Recreation Access Advisory Committee which will provide recommendations for the development
of accessibility guidelines for swimming pools, other recreational facilities, and outdoor developed areas. The
advisory committee is evaluating various means of access into the different types of swimming pools and aquatic facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board will consider the advisory committee's recommendations when it conducts a separate rulemaking in the future
to address recreational facilities. These future guidelines will apply to entities covered by both titles II and
III of the ADA and may specify a particular means of access for each application. At this time, ADAAG does not include
a specific requirement for access into swimming pools for entities covered under title III of the ADA. Entities covered
by title III, however, have an obligation to ensure ``equal opportunity'' for individuals with disabilities to participate
in and benefit from the services offered by places of public accommodation such as places of recreation. With respect
to newly constructed facilities, both the ADA and the Department of Justice title III regulation require that newly
constructed facilities be ``readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.'' That phrase means
that a facility or a portion of a facility must be constructed so that ``it can be approached, entered, and used by individuals
with disabilities&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;easily and conveniently.'' When a particular type of facility
is not specifically addressed by the guidelines, the preamble to Department of Justice title III regulation states
that the language of section 36.401 (a) (i.e., ``readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities'')
``is the safest guide.'' (56 FR 35576, July 26, 1991). The Department of Justice has taken the position that, in cases
where ADAAG does not contain requirements for a particular type of facilities, ADAAG or other appropriate technical
standards should be applied to the extent possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the initial rulemaking for ADAAG, the Board received comments recommending that an exception be established
in ADAAG 4.1.7(1)(a) where compliance with the alternative minimum requirements in ADAAG 4.1.7(3) would threaten
or destroy the characteristics that qualify the building as a historic property. In response to these comments, the
Board stated that it would consult with the National Park Service and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation on
this issue and propose an exception in the next rulemaking. Consequently, ADAAG 4.1.7(1)(a) was reserved for an exception.
See 56 FR 35430 (July 26, 1991). However, the Department of Justice issued its final regulations for titles II and III
of the ADA which included sections in each of those regulations on alterations to historic properties. These regulations
permitted alternative methods of access to be provided where compliance with the alternative minimum requirements
in ADAAG 4.1.7(3) would threaten or destroy the historic significance of a building or facility. See 28 CFR 35.151(d)(2)
and 28 CFR 36.405(b). In effect, the Department of Justice regulations have created exceptions. The NPRM proposed
to incorporate these provisions as an exception in ADAAG 4.1.7(1)(a).

Many commenters, including State historic preservation organizations, supported this exception for certain historic
properties and its inclusion in ADAAG. Some commenters expressed concern that the exception in proposed ADAAG 4.1.7(a)
did not accurately reflect the distinction between ``program access'' requirements for ``historic programs''
in the Department of Justice title II regulations (see 28 CFR 35.150(b)(2)) and the alterations provisions for historic
buildings and facilities in ADAAG. In these commenters' view, the ``program access'' requirements for ``historic
programs'' in the Department of Justice title II regulations is more stringent than the alteration provisions for
historic properties in ADAAG.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was general support from a majority of commenters for providing access to such counters. The NPRM asked questions
regarding the appropriateness of applying the examples of equivalent facilitation contained in ADAAG 7.2.(2)(iii)
to State and local facilities. Those examples included a folding shelf or space on the side of a counter in lieu of a lowered
counter. Commenters were divided on this issue. The commenters who favored including the examples viewed the examples
as effective alternatives for access to sales and service counters, teller windows, and information counters. Some
commenters stated that a great deal of writing may be required at counters in some State and local government facilities.
For example, testing, licensing and, applications for building permits require completing forms and other paperwork.
In these instances, commenters viewed a folding shelf and certain other alternative means as not constituting equivalent
facilitation. Many commenters opposed including the examples for new construction. They recommended they be applied
only where alterations are made to existing counters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters did not support including specific examples of equivalent facilitation and no such examples have
been included for sales and service counters, teller windows and information counters in State and local government
facilities. While counters in State and local government facilities may physically resemble those in places of public
accommodation and in commercial facilities, specific examples of equivalent facilitation in 7.2.(3)(iii) have
not been included because activities at counters covered in this section may require more writing or face-to-face

for equivalent facilitation which applies to all technical and scoping provisions including those in this section.
A folding shelf, in certain circumstances, may provide equal or greater access while it will not in others. The reference
to ADAAG 7.2(2) was removed from proposed ADAAG 7.2(3) and the text was rewritten so as not to include examples of equivalent

The NPRM also proposed that where counters or teller windows have solid partitions, a method for facilitating voice
communication such as a grille, talk-through baffle, or an intercom be provided. The majority of commenters supported
the provision and regarded it necessary to facilitate voice communication at counters or windows with solid partitions.
The NPRM asked whether there were other design solutions that could facilitate voice communication. Commenters
offered a number of options including portable or hardwired assistive listening systems and TTYs for meeting this
requirement.

metal detector ``wands'' and hand searches but did not have any information on alternative technologies. An airport
operator pointed out that the screening devices are specifically designed to react to metal, such as might be found
in braces and wheelchairs; and that, if devices did not so react, it would not be long before a terrorist pretended to

ADAAG contains design and construction requirements for accessibility and does not cover equipment. This does not
mean, however, that portable or non-fixed equipment is not covered by the ADA. Equipment and operational issues are
covered by the Department of Justice regulations implementing titles II and III (28 CFR Parts 35 and 36) and by the Department

This section addresses those facilities where judicial, legislative, and regulatory functions occur. Judicial
facilities consist of courthouses. Legislative facilities include town halls, city council chambers, city or county
commissioners' meeting rooms, and State capitols. Typically, a State capitol would contain Senate and House chambers
if bicameral, or one chamber if unicameral; and committee rooms, public meeting rooms, and other assembly areas.
Regulatory facilities are those which house State and local entities whose functions include regulating, governing,
or licensing activities. For example, this section would address those rooms where school board meetings, zoning
appeals, and adjudicatory hearings (e.g., drivers license suspensions) are held.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Board discussed tradition and the symbolic relationship of elements that pose unique design
challenges peculiar to courtrooms. In its comment, the Design Guide Subcommittee of the U.S. Judicial Conference
Committee on Space and Facilities (Design Guide Subcommittee) added that there are other factors involved, apart
from symbolism, which give rise to the requirements for the distinctive design features of courtrooms:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To understand properly courtroom design, and ultimately the design of any structure devoted to court facilities,
it is essential to recognize that the judicial process in the United States courts is purposefully adversarial and
confrontational. *&blank;*&blank;*

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the nature of controlled adversarial conduct used to find the truth that dictates much of courtroom design. The
judge's pre-eminent physical position at trial, robed and on a raised bench in an imposing high-ceilinged room, distanced
from the other participants, is, indeed, an aspect of symbolism. But these design features also are important types
of visual cues which significantly reinforce and enhance the ability of the judge to deal effectively with the often
emotional drama played out in federal and State courts. Real life dramas involving the lives, freedom, fortune, and
fundamental rights of the litigants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practical need for the visual identification of the judge's authority requires a deliberate use of space and scale
for psychological impact. This psychological element is extremely critical. It is perhaps the major factor in aiding
the judge to control the activities of trial participants and spectators in the courtroom.

The Board recognizes the symbolic and the psychological elements in the courtroom as well as the fundamental right
of all citizens to participate equally in the legal process. The Board believes that accessibility can be incorporated
into the design of the courtroom without adversely affecting the spatial, symbolic, or psychological relationship
between the participants.

to clarify that fixed judges' benches, and clerks' stations are not required to be on an accessible route if those elements

appropriate maneuvering clearances so that a ramp can easily be provided at a later date. Therefore, the judge's bench
is not required to be on an accessible route until the ramp is installed.

The NPRM sought comment on whether maneuvering space should be required in the jury box, witness stand, judge's bench,
clerk's station, speaker's rostrum, raised dais, bailiff's station and court reporter's station and the costs associated
with such a requirement. The majority of commenters supported a requirement for maneuvering space in all areas. Included
in these was the City of New York who submitted architectural plans designed by the New York Department of General Services
showing how they have provided full accessibility in new construction. A few commenters felt the requirement for
full maneuvering clearances was excessive. Other commenters supported a requirement for maneuvering space only
in public areas (i.e., jury box, witness stand, litigant stations and spectator area) and providing an exception
for work stations which would be covered under title I of the ADA. One architecture firm experienced in designing judicial
facilities, thought that requiring maneuvering space would expand the well of the courtroom and result in reduced
sight and hearing intelligibility of the participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As further discussed under 11.2.1(4), due to the complexity of courtroom and legislative chamber design and the difficulty
of providing an accommodation which may require a structural change, requiring maneuvering clearances will significantly
increase the accessibility and usability of the element and, in some cases, facilitate a reasonable accommodation
for an employee in the future. The interim final rule contains a requirement for maneuvering clearances complying
with ADAAG 4.2.3. The provision requires that the maneuvering space serve each area and allows either a 60 inch diameter
turning radius or a 60 inch by 60 inch T-shaped space for a pivoting 180-degree turn. For example, maneuvering space
for the witness box may be provided within the witness box or at a landing outside the witness box.

 ADAAG 4.33.2 references Figure 46 which illustrates different clear floor space requirements depending on the direction
of approach to the wheelchair accessible space. If a forward or rear approach is provided to the accessible space,
the minimum depth of the space is 48 inches. If a side approach is provided to the accessible space, the minimum depth
of the space is 60 inches. The extra depth for a side approach is needed to accommodate the turn required to maneuver
into and out of the space. These clear floor space requirements apply whether seating is in assembly areas, spectator
seating in a courtroom, a witness stand, jury box, or other similar areas.

 Language has been added in the exception to allow the use of portable lifts complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts

ADAAG 4.11 references ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Part XX, 1990 to incorporate its safety
requirements for platform lifts (wheelchair lifts). The Board recognizes that ASME A17.1 does not apply to portable
equipment other than portable escalators. However, in requiring portable lifts to comply with this standard, a minimum
level of safety will be ensured. Furthermore, the applicable exception under 4.1.3(5) (Accessible Buildings: New

 A fixed means of vertical access to the witness stand via ramp or lift can easily be provided in new construction without
adversely affecting the spatial or psychological relationship between the participants. In alterations, the provision
allows the use of a portable ramp or portable lift where it is technically infeasible to provide a fixed means of vertical
access to the witness stand or jury box as long as jurors or witnesses with disabilities are inside the defined area
of the jury box or witness stand. The provision does not prohibit the use of portable witness boxes. However, if portable
witness boxes are used, they should be used by all witnesses, not just those with disabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In altering existing courtrooms it may be technically infeasible to provide a fixed means of vertical access to the
jury box or witness stand. For example, if providing a permanent ramp to a witness stand would result in reducing seating
needed to meet the minimum legal requirements for jurors in a criminal case, only clear floor space to accommodate
a portable ramp would be required. In the above example, the clear floor space provided for the portable ramp may result
in the ramp projecting into the well of the courtroom. It may be inconvenient and, in some cases, hazardous to have a
permanently installed ramp project into the well of the courtroom at all times. In allowing the exemption in alterations,
the interim final rule is accommodating structural conditions while ensuring that accessibility is provided. Portable
ramps stored under the witness box is one solution for alterations as long as such ramps meet all the technical specifications
in ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All ramps, whether portable or permanently installed, are required to meet the technical specifications in ADAAG
4.8 (Ramps). However, in existing buildings or facilities where space limitations prohibit the use of a 1:12 slope,
ADAAG 4.1.6(2)(a) (Accessible Buildings: Alterations) does allow a slope between 1:10 and 1:12 for a maximum rise
of 6 inches and a slope between 1:8 and 1:10 for a maximum rise of 3 inches. This provision has been clarified by referencing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters were concerned about the feasibility of providing a front approach to the judge's bench, and clerks'
stations, and requested clarification of the requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The circulation route to the judge's bench and clerks' stations will either be from a restricted corridor behind the
courtroom or from the side of these work areas. The requirement for clear floor space for a front approach does not refer
to the circulation route to these areas. However, clear floor space must be provided within each work area to allow
a person using a wheelchair to position themselves at the work station in a forward position. The interim final rule
clarifies the location of the clear floor space requirement for a front approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters requested clarification of whether all or only a percentage of judges' benches are required to
be adaptable. Other commenters recommended a requirement for 100 percent accessible judges' benches in new construction
as required by the State of California. Commenters stated that once a design is proposed for providing adequate space
for full accessibility, there is no reason to require adaptability. Several commenters requested that the provision
should provide examples of adaptability and require the purchase of lifts or ramps for future installation to ensure
that it is not an undue burden to make judges' benches fully accessible at a later date.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The legislative history of the ADA states that areas used only by employees as work areas are covered by the guidelines,
but individual work stations are not required to be constructed in a fully accessible manner. H. Rept. 101&hyph;485,
pt. 3, at 63. The requirement for adaptability for judges' benches and other work areas is consistent with the legislative
history and ADAAG 4.1.1(3) (Areas Used Only by Employees as Work Areas) which requires areas used only by employees
as work areas be designed and constructed so that individuals with disabilities can approach, enter, and exit the
area. This provision requires all judges' benches and clerks' stations to be either accessible or adaptable and describes
how adaptability is applied to these areas. Adaptability means that maneuvering clearances and other features (e.g.,
fixed controls) shall be designed into the space so that accessibility can easily be provided at a later date. For example,
an adaptable judge's bench which is designed for a future installation of a ramp or lift would have the required maneuvering
clearances to approach, enter, and exit the ramp or lift, to maneuver at the bench (e.g., knee clearance), and to reach
any fixed controls (e.g., alarm buttons) already designed into the space. If adaptability is provided, the installation
of a ramp or lift at a later date should not require any additional structural modifications and therefore should not
be an undue burden. An appendix note further recommends that equipment such as a ramp be available so that accessibility
can be accomplished to at least one judge's bench and clerk's station to accommodate court proceedings. Unlike typical
office work stations, judges' benches and clerks' stations are typically elevated 6 inches to 21 inches. Due to the
complexity of courtroom and legislative chamber design and the difficulty of accommodating subsequent physical
change, the Board believes that requiring either accessible or adaptable judges' benches and clerks' stations will
significantly facilitate a reasonable accommodation for an employee in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested clarification that where doors or gates are provided at a lift, maneuvering space is required
by ADAAG 4.13 (Doors), and controls and operating mechanisms must comply with the reach ranges in 4.2 (Space Allowance
and Reach Ranges). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As previously discussed, ADAAG 11.2.1(1) requires doors or gates designed to allow passage into the well of the courtroom,
the witness stand, the jury box, and the speaker's rostrum and other areas to comply with ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). Gates
provided at lifts must also comply with the applicable provisions of ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). Additional maneuvering
clearances may need to be provided to ensure that the lift is accessible and usable by persons with disabilities. For
example, many persons using wheelchairs entering and exiting a platform lift in one direction can be accommodated
on a minimum 30 inch by 48 inch lift. However, if a person is required to make a 90 degree turn either entering or exiting
the platform lift, additional maneuvering clearances at the lift gate, and an increase in the platform size will need
to be provided. Applying the minimum maneuvering clearances at doorways and gates illustrated in Figures 25 and 26
show that the required clear floor space depends on whether the lift door can be approached straight on or at right angles,
and whether the door has both a latch and a closer. For a direct approach, straight through the lift, Figure 26 shows
that a lift platform with a minimum clear space of 48 inches in the direction of travel is required. If a right angle turn
must be made on the platform to exit, Figure 25(b) shows that a minimum clear width of 54 inches perpendicular to the
direction of approach is needed to accommodate the turn. However, these minimum clearances only illustrate the clearances
needed to operate the gate from a front approach, assuming the gate has an operating mechanism. A front approach is
preferred but would not necessarily be required at lift doors that automatically unlatch, since they do not have operating
mechanisms. However, the referenced clearances above do not take into account the difficulty of making a 90 degree
turn while backing out of the lift, a particularly difficult maneuver for a person who uses a motorized wheelchair.
Ideally, the platform lift should allow sufficient space for a person to make a 360 degree turn in order to approach
the gate from a forward position. Widening the gates to provide a 36 inch to 42 inch clear width will provide additional
maneuvering clearance.

city council chambers and other city and county commission meeting rooms. Such meeting rooms may be made available
for use by the public or guests may be invited to address the assembly. In such cases, the speaker's rostrum or raised

The NPRM sought comment on grab bar design, security concerns, and the potential for suicides in holding cells and
detention and correctional facilities. A majority of the commenters indicated that grab bars in accessible cells
do not pose any more of a suicide or security risk than other cell features such as cell grills, bed frames and air circulation
vents. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice stated that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective suicide prevention is not accomplished solely by rendering a cell protrusion-free. A jail's physical
plant cannot be designed, constructed or altered to ensure it is ``suicide-proof''. Effective suicide prevention
is a function of screening at admission, appropriate classification, adequate staff training and vigilant staff
supervision as well as physical plant design.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of the commenters cited a specific case in which an inmate used a grab bar to commit suicide. However, at least one
commenter stated that this could be a result of the under-reporting of jail suicides throughout the country and the
fact that grab bars are not yet predominantly provided. Several commenters were less concerned about persons with
disabilities misusing the grab bars than other detainees or inmates who, due to overcrowding, could be occupying
the accessible cells. Most commenters felt grab bars can be designed and installed in new construction without posing
a security risk. Commenters provided several examples such as designing an infill welded plate to close the gap between
the grab bar and wall and using ``embeds with welded connections or embeds with security screws.'' The latter method
would allow the removal of the grab bars when a person with a disability was not using the cell. One commenter further
suggested that where an infill welded plate is used, the outside diameter should be enlarged to two inches to compensate
for the inability to totally wrap one's fingers around the bar's surface. Several commenters added that clustering
the accessible cells would enhance the ability to effectively monitor detainees and inmates and further minimize
security risks. Other suggestions included limiting the accessible cells only to detainees or inmates with disabilities;
locating the accessible cell in the infirmary or other health care unit; or requiring grab bars only in institutions
with sentenced inmates where behavior is more predictable.

Several commenters suggested that an exemption be provided for alterations. One commenter stated that the use of
steel embeds is structurally impracticable insofar as the installation of embeds would require reconstruction
of the entire wall into which the embed was installed. The commenter further stated that a grab bar could be welded to
a steel plate bolted through an existing wall to another steel plate on the back of the wall. However, several factors
would determine the feasibility of this solution including whether the back of the wall is available to hold a steel
plate as well as the type of existing wall upon which the steel plate is installed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If compliance with alterations requirements is technically infeasible, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) requires that the alteration
provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Technically infeasible means, with respect to an alteration
of a building or a facility, that it has little likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions
would require removing or altering a load-bearing member which is an essential part of the structural frame; or because
other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features
which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary
to provide accessibility. Any elements or features of the building or facility that are being altered and can be made
accessible are required to be made accessible within the scope of the alteration. There may be circumstances in an
alteration to holding cells where grab bars cannot be securely attached to meet security requirements due to structural
conditions in an existing wall. In such cases, the installation of grab bars would not be required because it would
be technically infeasible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several combination stainless steel water closet and lavatory units are available that cannot incorporate a 36 inch
grab bar behind the water closet. The NPRM asked whether standard combination units are available which meet the requirements
of the proposed guidelines and whether combination units are required to the exclusion of separate fixtures by any
State, local or other codes. Manufacturers acknowledged that the standard design of combination units, including
those otherwise considered accessible by the industry, do not fully meet ADAAG specifications. One commenter stated
that combination units are preferred because only one wall opening is required for plumbing connections, rather
than two wall openings if separate fixtures are provided. Another commenter added that a typical cell design provides
a single plumbing chase which will serve two cells. These chases are built on an angle in order to maximize the space
available and can easily accommodate a combination unit. One manufacturer stated that although the combination
unit does not fully comply with the proposed guidelines, the design of combination units provides maximum strength
and security within the practical limits of manufacturing. The commenter was concerned that lengthening the combination
unit to accommodate a 36 inch long grab bar would make the unit less able to withstand the stresses it may be subjected
to through vandalism. The commenter further noted that a shorter grab bar can be provided. Several correctional agencies
commented that combination units are used primarily because they require less space than separate fixtures. The
only source identified as actually requiring combination units was Virginia's ``Guide of Minimum Standards in Design
and Construction of Jail Facilities'' which requires such units in maximum security cells. A few commenters took
the position that if combination units are not accessible, then separate fixtures should be required. A number of
commenters recommended that an exception be provided for a reduced grab bar length in alterations to mitigate the
structural and plumbing chase modifications required in making the cell accessible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments indicated that although the use of combination units are preferred for space efficiency and security and
required by at least one State's guidelines for jail facilities, they are not mandatory. An exception for the length
of the rear grab bar on combination units has not been provided in new construction or alterations since separate,
accessible lavatories and toilets are readily available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an alteration to toilet and lavatory fixtures, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(b) requires that accessible fixtures be provided
in compliance with the applicable provisions for new construction. However, as described above, if compliance with
the alteration requirements is technically infeasible, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) requires that the alteration provide
accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. For example, if providing separate accessible fixtures would necessitate
combining two cells to create one accessible cell or where the existing plumbing chase construction would preclude
recessing connections for separate fixtures, combination units may be utilized. ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) still requires
that the alteration provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Therefore, the combination unit that
most closely complies with the technical provisions for toilets and lavatories should be provided.

This section requires that where fixed cubicles are provided, at least 5 percent, but not less than one, must have the
maximum counter height and knee clearance underneath as required by ADAAG 4.32 (Fixed or Built-in Seating or Tables)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM asked whether at least one cubicle should be accessible on both sides to accommodate those situations where
both the detainee and visitor require accessible features. The majority of commenters supported a requirement that
at least one cubicle be accessible on both sides. Several commenters from organizations representing persons with
disabilities proposed that all cubicles be accessible. One commenter felt accommodations should be mandated, but
discretion should be given to the facility to design the best remedy.

One commenter thought the scoping of 5 percent was excessive considering most visiting areas use non-fixed tables
and chairs and that the percentage of the inmate population that have disabilities is low.

The scoping and technical specification is consistent with ADAAG 4.1.3(18) (Fixed or Built-in Seating) which requires
that 5 percent, but not less than one, of the built-in seating areas or tables and counters in public and common use areas
have a maximum height of 34 inches and knee clearance underneath. A visiting area would have to have twenty built-in
cubicles to trigger a second accessible cubicle. No changes were made to this scoping provision.

The NPRM sought comment on the cost impact of requiring at least one restricted entrance and at least one secured entrance
to be accessible. The majority of commenters considered the cost negligible. One commenter stated that cost was not
relevant as separate entrances are a mandatory program requirement. Two commenters recommended that all secured
entrances be accessible. Several correctional officials and design professionals indicated that design requirements
may necessitate use of 300 to 500 pound doors. Such doors cannot meet the specification for closing and opening forces
in ADAAG 4.13.10 (Door Closers) and 4.13.11 (Door Opening Force) without, at a minimum, power-assist devices.

In the NPRM, at least one restricted and secured entrance was required to be accessible according to ADAAG 4.14 (Entrances).
ADAAG 4.14.1 requires, in part, that accessible entrances ``shall be connected by an accessible route to public transportation
stops, to accessible parking and passenger loading zones, and to public streets or sidewalks if available *&blank;*&blank;*''
One comment indicated that entrances used by inmates or detainees and not the public should not be required to be connected
by an accessible route to such elements since inmates usually arrive from system-operated vehicles and not from public
transportation stops, parking spaces, or public streets and sidewalks.

ADAAG 4.14 requires accessible entrances to be connected by an accessible route to public transportation stops,
accessible parking, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks if available. The interim final rule
contains an exemption at secured entrances for a connecting accessible route to public transportation stops, parking
spaces, or public streets and sidewalks but not passenger loading zones. An example of a passenger loading zone at
a secured entrance would be where detainees arrive or depart from a system-operated vehicle. The provision clarifies
that such passenger loading zones, where provided, must comply with ADAAG 4.6.6 (Passenger Loading Zones).

The NPRM asked whether the proposed requirement for 50 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems
met the needs of persons with hearing impairments and on the costs associated with providing permanently installed
assistive listening systems. One commenter requested clarification that the other 50 percent must be accessible
with portable assistive listening systems. Several commenters recommended a requirement for 100 percent permanently
installed assistive listening systems. These commenters cited operational problems such as scheduling and the
inability of staff to locate and set up portable systems. Other commenters preferred portable systems because they
believe them to be more flexible, cost effective and easier to replace as technology evolves. Other commenters were
concerned that other methods to facilitate communication would not be provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines facilitate greater flexibility in the types of assistive listening devices a facility may offer by
requiring 50 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems and requiring electrical outlets in 11.8
(Electrical Outlets, Wiring, and Conduit for Communication Systems) and allowing the remaining 50 percent of the
rooms to utilize portable devices. The provisions for permanently installed assistive listening systems in this
section and for electrical outlets, wiring, and conduit in ADAAG 11.8 is intended to enable a facility to maximize
its choices in selecting the most effective method of assistive communication equipment to accommodate persons
with disabilities. However, the requirement for 50 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems
should not be interpreted as the only method of communication a facility is required to provide. For example, computer-aided
transcription might be a more appropriate auxiliary aid for a person who is deaf or has a severe hearing loss. The Department
of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA require public entities to take such steps as may be necessary
to ensure effective communication for individuals with hearing impairments, unless it would result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. (28
CFR 35.160(a) and 28 CFR 35.164). No changes were made in the interim final rule.

Different departments in regulatory facilities may have their own hearing rooms. If the interim final rule required
50 percent of each type of hearing room designated for public use in regulatory facilities to have a permanently installed
assistive listening system, it may result in 100 percent coverage. For reasons cited above, the interim final rule
allows some degree of flexibility in accommodating persons with hearing impairments. Mediation rooms would be covered
under the requirement for hearing rooms. A hearing room or mediation room is a room where deliberation occurs.

If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, ADAAG 4.1.6(b) requires that each such altered element,
space, feature, or area meet the new construction requirements. For example, an alteration replacing the public
announcement system in a courtroom would require the installation of an assistive listening system. An alteration
limited to replacing the judge's bench would not trigger the requirement for a permanently installed assistive listening
system. However, if alterations of single elements, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or
space in a building or facility, ADAAG 4.1.6(c) requires that the entire space meet the new construction requirements.
Facilities are encouraged to consider each project as an opportunity to further the accessibility of its facility
and should not unnecessarily restrict the scope of work so as to avoid the requirements for new accessible elements
or construction.

As provided in the appendix note at A11.9(2), this section does not require permanently installed assistive listening
systems in conference rooms restricted to use by employees, consultants and other invited guests. Nor does this section
require such systems in a space which is only occasionally or sporadically used for legislative or regulatory business
such as a town meeting held in a high school cafeteria. The term ``designated for public use'' refers only to those areas
of a facility in which public debate, discussion or regulation takes place. Examples of hearing rooms or meeting rooms
in regulatory facilities would include rooms in which hearings are held on zoning applications or waivers or where
town council meetings or school board meetings are conducted. On the State level, a hearing or meeting room might be
the committee room in a State legislative facility. In judicial facilities, a hearing or meeting room might be the
judge's chambers or a mediation room. No changes were made to this provision.

Several comments were received regarding the number of required receivers. Some commenters felt the required number
of receivers should not be tied to the occupant load of each covered room. Other commenters were concerned that the

The four percent figure is based on a Bureau of the Census estimate of the number of persons aged 15 and over who have difficulty
hearing what is said in a normal conversation with another person, excluding those who cannot hear at all. See ``Bureau
of Census, Disability Functional Limitation and Insurance Coverage'' (1984-85). However, it should be noted that
the guidelines are minimum requirements. If there is a greater demand for more receivers, the Department of Justice
regulations implementing title II of the ADA requires public entities to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure
effective communication with individuals with hearing impairments, unless it would result in a fundamental alteration
in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.160(a)

The NPRM sought comment on how issues of confidentiality and privacy can be addressed while providing accessibility
for persons with vision and hearing impairments. The majority of the commenters did not consider confidentiality
a problem. The Design Guide Subcommittee expressed concern that assistive listening systems in jury deliberation
and grand jury suites pose potential problems of improper and illegal remote monitoring, but did not recommend that
such areas be exempt from providing assistive listening systems. Commenters offered several solutions such as requiring
transcriptions to be destroyed by proper authorities (similar to the current practice of requiring jurors to return
writing tablets); confiscating disks or utilizing security programs in computers. For example, one commenter stated
that State telecommunications relay services use software which deletes the message typed by the communication
assistant at the end of each page or wherever designated. Similar software can be utilized for a judicial setting.

comprised a significant proportion of the commenters on this section. Extensive comments were received from a number
of State correctional agencies, including those from the Illinois Department of Corrections, which were supported
by correctional agencies of 22 other States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In addition, the Association of State
Correctional Administrators (ASCA) submitted the results of a survey it conducted based on questions and issues
raised in the NPRM. A total of 30 State correctional officials responded to the ASCA survey. All together, the views
of 44 different States were expressed either in comments submitted directly to the Board, through the ASCA survey,
or through the Illinois Department of Corrections. These comments focused primarily on State prison systems and
facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments addressing local and county facilities were also received. Responses from the operators of local detention
or correctional systems represented a more modest portion of the comments and ranged from the cities of New York and
Las Vegas to the villages of Arlington Heights and Schaumburg in Illinois. In addition, several State agencies that
oversee or regulate local and county detention and correctional facilities provided information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this section applies to facilities owned or operated by State and local governments, information and comment

system, and the National Institute of Correction, which provides leadership and assistance in the field of corrections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Besides agencies involved in the detention or corrections field, comments were also received from individuals,
State and local government agencies (including those concerned with accessibility), code administrators, local
and national disability groups, such as the Paralyzed Veterans of America, design professionals, and various trade
or professional associations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An overall concern raised by many State and local correctional administrators both in written comments and at the
public hearings addressed the degree to which these guidelines rely on specific design requirements in establishing
a minimum level of accessibility. These guidelines, many correctional authorities maintained, should not address
accessibility solely in terms of design criteria but should take into account operational and program alternatives
and considerations that are inherent within State and local detention and correctional systems. Further, commenters
argued that these guidelines should afford operators the flexibility and discretion considered necessary to effectively
and efficiently provide access. Many correctional systems already have certain procedures and policies in place
that determine how and where access is provided within the system. Thus, many corrections administrators considered
it important that the guidelines acknowledge existing alternatives, including those of an operational nature,
instead of mandating access strictly in terms of architectural specifications for buildings and facilities. This
point was emphasized in relation to the required number and location of accessible cells and is further discussed
below in ADAAG 12.4 (Holding and Housing Cells or Rooms: Minimum Number and Dispersion).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is understood that correctional administrators may oversee an entire State- or city-wide system and are responsible
for its programs and services, not just its buildings and facilities. Accessibility is not solely a matter of architectural
design. However, the Board's statutory mandate is to ensure accessibility of the built environment in the case of
new construction or alterations. Consequently, these and other guidelines the Board has issued under the ADA must
address accessibility in terms of architectural design in new construction and alterations. The ADA does not give
the Board the authority to address programs or services or existing buildings, except in the case of alterations.
The Department of Justice is responsible under the ADA for addressing programs and services in the public sector.
See 28 CFR part 35. The Department of Justice's regulation, consistent with the statute, focuses on program access
and allows the level of flexibility and discretion desired by detention and corrections operators in providing accessibility
in existing buildings and facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Still, some comments stressed that flexibility was essential in new construction as well. For example, some corrections
officials were concerned about the guidelines requiring accessibility in new jails or prisons that, under current
assignment policies or procedures, would not be intended to house inmates with disabilities. The Board's statutory
mandate severely limits the degree to which operational or procedural alternatives can be addressed in guidelines
that must specify a minimum level of architectural accessibility. Existing inmate assignment or placement policies
may have to be reconsidered in relation to general prohibitions of discrimination based on disability set forth in
the ADA and the Department of Justice's regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments recommended that these guidelines outline a minimum level of accessibility in general terms by specifying
the desired result or ``end'' and allowing operators the opportunity to determine the ``means'' or methods of meeting
it. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the requirements of other special application sections of this rule
as well as those guidelines previously issued for the private sector under title III of the ADA. Furthermore, incorporating
flexibility into a design guideline must be weighed against clearly and precisely detailing the requirements for
building access for the benefit of architects and designers.

This section covers both detention facilities, such as holding cells in police stations, and correctional facilities,
such as prisons and reformatories. Generally, detention facilities are used to hold persons apprehended or arrested
for alleged violations of law, whereas correctional facilities typically house those persons who have been found
guilty of a crime and have been incarcerated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In both proposing and issuing these interim final guidelines, the Board recognized the wide range of facilities covered
by this section, from small jails in rural areas to major prisons in extensive State systems such as California's which,
according to its Department of Corrections, house over 100,000 inmates and feature large self-contained sites that
operate like a ``small city.'' Comments on how a requirement may impact facilities of a certain type in particular
were carefully considered and proposed provisions altered accordingly. For example, specifications for certain
elements, such as beds, which are typically provided in correctional housing cells but not detention holding cells,
are applicable only where the element is provided; additionally, exceptions to certain requirements based on necessary
security considerations are stated generally even though in practice they may be applicable only to correctional
facilities, or portions thereof, with a significant level of security. Consequently, this section has not been subdivided
according to facility type.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The types of facilities covered by this section include those institutional occupancies where occupants other than
employees are under some degree of restraint or restriction for security reasons. The NPRM asked whether certain
mental institutions, such as those housing persons considered to be criminally insane, should be addressed by this
section or by ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities), which contains a reference to ``psychiatric facilities.'' A majority
of the responses recommended that these facilities should be covered by ADAAG 6. This opinion was shared by State and
local government agencies, the National Institute of Corrections, and several design professionals. Some State
correctional authorities indicated that inmates may receive psychiatric treatment in State hospital facilities
that are clearly medical care occupancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A slightly smaller number of responses recommended that the guidelines address mental institutions in both ADAAG
6 and ADAAG 12 or allow use of either section. For example, the Paralyzed Veterans of America recommended using ADAAG
6 for such occupancies in general and ADAAG 12 for institutions serving persons found criminally insane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments from the operators of correction systems and the Bureau of Prisons recommended coverage of these
facilities in ADAAG 12 due to certain security considerations more typical of a detention or correctional facility
than of a medical occupancy. The City of New York shared this opinion and noted that its Department of Corrections has
jurisdiction over such facilities.

The mixed response among commenters suggests that there may be facilities or portions of facilities that are operated
or used by correctional systems to provide psychiatric care to inmates or that have levels of security appropriate
for the restraint and confinement of persons determined to be criminally insane. ADAAG 6 would not adequately cover
these areas since issues of security are addressed in ADAAG 12. While psychiatric facilities are subject to ADAAG
6, certain facilities or areas within them may require higher levels of security and thus more closely approximate
the definition of detention and correction facilities of ADAAG 12.1 than the definition of medical care facilities
of ADAAG 6.1. In such instances, ADAAG 12 may be used for those specific areas or portions of a facility. This is consistent
with the use of other special application sections where facilities contain areas subject to different sections.
For example, a hotel is subject to ADAAG 9 (Accessible Transient Lodging) but may also contain retail space subject
to ADAAG 7 (Business, Mercantile and Civic) and dining areas covered by ADAAG 5 (Restaurants and Cafeterias).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 12.1 notes that public and common use areas are to be accessible. A corresponding appendix note clarifies the
application of ``common use'' areas to detention and correctional facilities by listing various examples, such
as exercise yards and recreation areas, workshops and areas of instruction and vocational training, counseling
centers, cafeterias, commissaries, and medical facilities. Although this list was meant to be illustrative and
not exhaustive, the NPRM asked whether further clarification was needed on this subject and if there were other types
of common use areas that should be specifically addressed in the appendix note. A slight majority of the comments recommended
further clarification, usually by naming certain specific types of rooms or spaces that should be considered ``common
use areas.'' Most of these recommendations fall within the types listed in the appendix note. For example, comments
recommended specifying classrooms, work areas and job sites, which would fall under the term ``areas of instruction
or vocational training'' or recommended day rooms, television rooms, libraries, and multi-purpose rooms which
would be covered by ``exercise yards and recreation areas.'' The Board sought to list more generalized and inclusive
terms. Areas recommended by comments but not referenced in the proposed list include areas for finger-printing and
booking, intake and release, questioning and hearing or meeting rooms; laundry facilities; religious areas, such
as chapels; and barber or beauty shops.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Various administrative areas, such as those used for intake and release, are common areas used by inmates. However,
only that portion of such areas used by inmates would be considered common use space as defined in this section. In many
cases these areas are comprised primarily of employee work areas. In view of this, areas of this type have not been specifically
listed as common use areas although spaces within them may be commonly used by inmates and thus be required to be accessible.
Many of the other areas recommended for inclusion in the list but not originally covered in the appendix note should
be considered common use areas. Since an almost equal number of commenters felt that further clarification was not
necessary, these areas have been addressed by including a reference to ``any other rooms, spaces, or elements that
are made available for the use of a group of inmates or detainees.'' This language is derived from the existing ADAAG
definition of ``common use.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Typical prison design often includes some common use areas, such as dayrooms, that in the restricted and secured environment
serve a specific group of cells and are used only by the inmates of those cells. Thus, the proposed requirement for the
accessibility of common use areas was limited to those ``serving accessible cells or rooms.'' Several comments supported
this provision as proposed but almost an equal number expressed concern about visitors or staff members, such as social
workers or clergy, who may need access to such areas, including those serving inaccessible cells or rooms.

ADAAG 4.1.1(3) requires that areas used only by employees as work areas be accessible to the extent a person with a disability
can ``approach, enter, and exit the areas.'' Detention and correctional facilities are not exempt from this provision.
Thus, common use areas that contain work areas would have to be on an accessible route. This requirement also applies
to common use areas that do not serve accessible cells or rooms. For example, a counseling center serving a portion
of a facility with no accessible cells would have to be on an accessible route so that the area used by counselors as a
work area can be approached, entered, and exited by persons with disabilities. Language has been added to the appendix
note to 12.1 emphasizing that common use areas that contain or function as work areas or public use areas are still subject
to applicable ADAAG requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Areas that serve members of the public, such as waiting rooms and contact and non-contact visiting areas, are considered
public use areas and are subject to the requirements for accessibility. This provision has been clarified so that
the reference to ``areas serving accessible cells or rooms'' applies only to common use areas and not public use areas.

Several commenters were concerned about the applicability of certain existing ADAAG requirements to detention
and correctional facilities. Corrections officials recommended an exemption to the requirement for areas of rescue
assistance in ADAAG 4.1.3(9) since inmates do not evacuate the facility independently. Further, areas of rescue
assistance may also compromise security. Several commenters noted that signage, particularly that which is raised
and brailled, can pose a security risk since it can be removed from walls. Consequently, it was recommended that the
requirements for signage apply only to public use areas.

An exception to the requirement for areas of rescue assistance has been provided. This exception references both
scoping requirements in ADAAG 4.1.3(9) and technical requirements in ADAAG 4.3.10 and 4.3.11 for areas of rescue
assistance. This exception applies only to the requirement for areas of rescue assistance in ADAAG 4.1.3(9) and not
to the requirement for accessible means of egress. With respect to signage, the exception clarifies that the scoping
requirements for accessible signage in ADAAG 4.1.3(16) apply only to public use areas.

The American Public Communications Council, a trade association representing the manufacturers, distributors,
and operators of pay telephone equipment, expressed concerns about requirements applicable to inmate-use telephones.
Such telephones are typically provided in common use areas and must be properly secured to withstand vandalism and
removal. Additional features, such as a volume control, which is highly vulnerable to vandalism, can dramatically
increase the cost, perhaps up to 66 percent. The Council correctly assumed that general scoping requirements for
telephones in ADAAG 4.1.3(17) would apply only to those common use areas serving accessible cells. The Council also
raised concern about ADAAG technical requirements for telephones. Specifically, ADAAG 4.31.2 requires sufficient
clear floor space at telephones, and ADAAG 4.31.8 requires handset cords to be at least 29 inches long. However, according
to the Council, phones for inmate use may be located near cell bars and thus not provide adequate clear floor space.
In addition, security requires that the length of handset cords not exceed 15 inches. Thus, the Council recommended
that the guidelines allow other alternatives, such as providing phones that are accessible at supervised locations.

The requirements for accessible telephones and volume control in ADAAG 4.1.3(17) would apply only to public use areas
and to those common use areas serving accessible cells or rooms. Certain security considerations, such as short phone
cord lengths, underscore the request for allowable alternatives to ADAAG scoping and technical requirements for
telephones. Under ADAAG 2.2 (Equivalent Facilitation) alternatives to ADAAG requirements are allowed as long as
greater or equal access is provided. This provision may allow flexibility in providing access to inmate-use telephones.

ADAAG 4.1.3(8) primarily addresses those entrances serving the public. Other entrances not intended for public
use are not required to be accessible under ADAAG in most cases. Correctional and detention facilities may contain
entrances that inmates or detainees must use for security purposes and that are not open to the public. In order to ensure
facility access to inmates with disabilities, this section contains, as originally proposed, a requirement that
at least one such entrance be accessible. The proposed requirement had referred to these entrances as ``secured entrances''
defined as ``those entrances used only by inmates or detainees and security personnel and not the general public.''
This was intended to distinguish such entrances from public entrances already addressed by ADAAG.

Several correctional administrators indicated that the proposed definition and use of the term ``secured entrances''
is inconsistent with industry usage of the term. Specifically, entrances located within secured perimeters, and
thus considered ``secured'' by corrections officials, may in fact serve visitors and other members of the public.
Basically, the terms ``secured entrance'' and ``public entrance'' are defined to be mutually exclusive in the guidelines
when this is not necessarily the case in practice.

The Board considers distinction between entrances used by the public and those used by inmates or detainees necessary
to ensure an accessible route into the facility for inmates, particularly in those cases where visitors and inmates
use separate entrances. ADAAG 12.2.1 has been revised to clarify that entrances serving the public, including those
that are secured, are required to be accessible by ADAAG 4.1.3(8). Security requirements at such entrances have been
taken into account as further discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The requirement for the accessibility of entrances used by inmates and detainees but not the public has been relocated
to ADAAG 12.2.2 to distinguish them from entrances considered public entrances covered in ADAAG 12.2.1. The provision's
heading has been changed from ``Secured Entrances'' to ``Other Entrances.'' The requirement that, where entrances
serving inmates or detainees only are provided, at least one be accessible is substantively similar to the proposed
provision. Thus, while the term ``secured'' has been removed from this provision it still covers the same type of entrances
as the proposed requirement. The term ``secured'' has been retained in ADAAG 11 which covers judicial, regulatory,
and legislative facilities since commenters did not express any concern about its usage with respect to such occupancies.

A design firm discussed certain security considerations that may conflict with full compliance for doors and entrances.
According to this commenter, secured entrances or sallyports may be equipped with swinging doors weighing between
300 to 500 pounds that would need power assist openers and closers to meet the requirements for door closers in ADAAG
4.13.10 (Door Closers) and the maximum 5 lbf opening force required in ADAAG 4.13.11 (Door Opening Force). In addition,
this commenter noted that some accessible types of door hardware used to meet ADAAG 4.13.9 (Door Hardware), such as
lever handles, are considered a security threat in that they can be more easily removed or broken and used as a weapon.

In the proposed rule, the requirement for access through or around security systems or screening devices included
an exception for doors at such locations. Under this exception, doors operated only by security personnel were exempt
from the requirements for maneuvering clearance at doors (4.13.6), accessible door hardware (4.13.9), opening
forces (4.13.11), and specifications for automatic doors if provided (4.13.12). This exception has been revised
to apply to both entrances used by the public and those entrances used by inmates or detainees. This revision is consistent
with an exception in ADAAG 11.5 (Restricted and Secured Entrances). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition, a reference to the requirements for door closers (4.13.10) has been added to the exception. While the
exception as proposed was limited only to doors operated by security personnel, it is implicit that the security considerations
raised by comments also apply to those doors that may not be operated by security personnel. Consequently, the exception
has been broadened to cover not only doors and doorways operated by security personnel, but also those doors and doorways
subject to security requirements that prohibit full compliance with these provisions. This would apply to those
doors that may be operated by visitors or inmates, as well as security personnel. The independent use of doors is, of
course, a critical component of accessibility. This exception applies only where security requirements prohibit
compliance with the specific provisions listed. Where security requirements prohibit full compliance, the applicable
specifications are to be met to the maximum extent feasible.

that entrances ``be connected by an accessible route to public transportation stops, to accessible parking and passenger
loading zones, and to public streets or sidewalks if available *&blank;*&blank;*'' As noted in ADAAG 11.5, one corrections
official indicated that entrances used only by inmates or detainees should not be required to be connected by an accessible
route to such elements since inmates usually arrive from system-operated vehicles and not from public transportation
stops, parking spaces, or public streets and sidewalks.

or detainees is not required to be provided. Rather, if such entrances are provided, then at least one is required to
be accessible under ADAAG 12.2.2. In the case of alterations, this requirement would be triggered only where such
an existing entrance is to be altered or where a new one is to be installed as part of the planned scope of work. If so, then
at least one entrance of this type would have to be accessible to the extent technically feasible under alteration
provisions in ADAAG 4.1.6. In addition, under ADAAG 4.1.6(3), such an entrance may be required to be accessible if
it is part of the path of travel to an altered primary function area.

The NPRM asked for information on the new construction cost of making accessible at least one entrance used only by
inmates or detainees. Almost all responses to this question characterized the cost as either ``minimal,'' ``negligible,''
or ``insignificant.'' Several operators of correctional systems, including New York City and the State of California,
indicated that this requirement would have little or no impact on their facilities since the accessibility of such
entrances is already required. Few comments provided actual cost estimates. One State disability organization
estimated a new construction cost of $450, and a local government entity estimated a cost of $3,000 for ``altering''
a secured entrance but did not provide a new construction cost estimate.

This section requires that an accessible route be provided through or around security screening devices. These devices,
which may be similar to those used at airports, may not allow passage of certain mobility aids, such as wheelchairs.

The NPRM asked whether there were any existing security or screening procedures that could not be effectively carried
out under this requirement. Practically all comments, including those from correction or detention officials and
the Bureau of Prisons, indicated that there were no existing security or screening procedures that could not be carried
out under this requirement. Some indicated that security systems may already have an adjacent route around the system
for staff use. Also, several commenters noted that hand-held metal detection devices are used to screen persons using
wheelchairs or other mobility aids that cannot pass through the system.

This provision remains substantively unchanged. However, it has been clarified to apply to security systems located
at either public entrances covered by ADAAG 12.2.1 or inmate or detainee entrances covered by ADAAG 12.2.2. As noted
above, the exception originally proposed for doors and gates at security systems has been revised and is applicable
to entrances themselves, not just the doors or gates that may be provided along alternative routes around security
systems.

The requirements of this section for visiting areas are similar to those addressed in ADAAG 11 (Judicial, Legislative,

As discussed under ADAAG 11.4.3 (Visiting Areas), the NPRM asked whether this provision should further specify that
an accessible cubicle on each side be paired in order to accommodate those situations in which both the inmate or detainee
and the visitor need an accessible cubicle. A majority of the comments to this question, including its applicability
to visiting areas in detention and correctional facilities, supported such a requirement.

Both contact and non-contact visiting areas, as public or common use areas, are required to be accessible under ADAAG
12.1. Non-contact visiting areas are addressed in this section since they contain elements, such as safety glass
or security glazing, that may pose barriers to communication. Requirements for fixed cubicles are based on ADAAG

 The five percent scoping is consistent with ADAAG requirements for fixed seating in ADAAG 11.4.3 (Visiting Areas).
However, since the secured side of a visiting area functions as a common use area among inmates or detainees, an exception
has been added that is consistent with ADAAG 12.1 which states that only those common use areas serving accessible
cells or rooms are required to be accessible. Under this exception, non-contact visiting areas serving areas of a
facility where no accessible cells or rooms are located are not required to have accessible cubicles on the inmate
or detainee side.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-contact visiting areas typically have safety glass or security glazing to separate visitors and inmates or detainees.
ADAAG 12.3(2) references ADAAG 7.2(3) which covers a similar situation at teller windows or counters and requires
that at least one provide a method to facilitate voice communication. ADAAG 7.2(3)(iii) indicates that various methods
may include grilles, talk-thru baffles, intercoms or telephone handset devices. If telephone handset devices are
used, this provision further requires that at least one such device be equipped with a volume control complying with
ADAAG 4.31.5. One State correctional agency noted that it currently uses hand-held intercoms that are equipped with
telephone-style volume controls, which is preferred over the use of an assistive listening system.

 Telephone handset devices are acceptable under this provision so long as at least one is equipped with a volume control.
Assistive listening devices are not required at these locations. The appendix note to ADAAG 12.3 indicates that if
an assistive listening system is provided, consideration should be given to the intended users and the setting in
determining the most suitable type of system. The use of assistive listening systems is not recommended over other
communication methods. Also, as noted in ADAAG 11.4.3 (Visiting Areas), ``security glazing'' has been substituted
for ``safety glass'' as was recommended by one correctional authority.

The proposed rule contained a requirement that accessible cubicles be identified with the International Symbol
of Accessibility. As noted in ADAAG 11.4.3, several comments questioned the need for such identification since users
are typically escorted to visiting areas by security personnel. Further, signage which can be vandalized or removed
may pose a security hazard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions and issues raised in the NPRM about the minimum number and dispersion of accessible cells evoked more comment
than any other in this section. The NPRM requested survey data on the percentage of inmates with disabilities in State
and local prisons and jails. Most of the comments providing survey data were submitted by State correctional agencies.
Among those State agencies responding to the NPRM, the percentage of inmates with mobility impairments or who used
wheelchairs in State prisons systems ranged from .12 to 1.35 percent with an average of .46 percent. The Illinois Department
of Corrections also shared the results of a national survey it completed in 1990 which indicate that among 27 responding
States and the Bureau of Prisons, the percentage of the inmate population with ``ambulation problems'' ranged from
.04 to 1.2 percent and also averaged .46 percent. In addition, the Association of State Correctional Administrators
(ASCA) surveyed its members on this question but did not specify a breakout according to disability type. The results
of this survey contained significantly higher percentages, suggesting that a wider range of disabilities, not just
mobility or ambulatory impairments, were included in the percentages. Among 23 responding States, the average percentage
of the inmate population identified as having a disability was 3.39 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survey data were also received on local prison and jail populations. Three State agencies that oversee local or county
jails and prisons provided survey results. A survey of 10 Nebraska county jails identified .07 percent of the 1991
population as having a mobility impairment. In a survey of 204 county facilities, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards
determined that on average .48 percent of the daily population has a mobility impairment. According to California
Board of Corrections, a daily average of 1 to 1.5 percent of the population ``requires a physical accommodation''
in county facilities among a representative sampling of 11 counties. In addition, several comments from county correctional
authorities estimated that less than 1 percent of the population in their systems have mobility impairments, and
one other noted that 2 percent of the population has a disability. At the local level, the City of New York submitted
data indicating that .25 percent of the population in its system use wheelchairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons indicated that a 1992 survey of inmates in the Federal prisons system identified 1.25 percent
of the inmates as having some type of disability and approximately .5 percent as having ``manual'' impairments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further assess the need for accessible cells, the NPRM asked whether there are any instances in which inmates with
disabilities are not housed among the general population but are housed in other areas, such as infirmaries, or are
located to another facility entirely, such as a halfway house, due to a lack of accessible cells or rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments from State correctional systems noted that inmates may be housed in other areas of facilities but that
this was not necessarily due to the absence of accessible cells. A comment made by the Illinois Department of Correction
is representative of many of these comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are instances where inmates with disabilities are housed in areas other than [the] general population. This
is a reflection not as much of whether an accessible cell is available in [the] general population, but rather of the
Department's conclusion that in many instances programs and services can be more effectively delivered to disabled
inmates who are clustered, rather than dispersed. In some instances disabled inmates are housed in infirmaries where
the level of supervision is generally greater and where medical services are more readily available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of the States responding to the ASCA survey indicated that inmates with disabilities are housed in areas
other than housing for the general population because accessible cells are not available. Like the Illinois Department
of Corrections, some States base this practice on what they believe is a more effective provision of services, including
medical care. Several States noted that the area used was an infirmary or medical unit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information received on county facilities indicates that there are instances where detainees or inmates have been
transferred to other facilities due to the insufficient number of accessible cells. Of 11 counties surveyed by the
California Board of corrections, four expressed a need for more accessible cells, and the operators of Texas county
jails surveyed indicated that inmates with disabilities are relocated when accessible cells are full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM also asked whether there are instances in which persons with a disability are sentenced or assigned to facilities
other than a prison or jail due to a lack of accessibility. A few comments indicated that this does occur. One State agency
noted that some prison operators may house persons with disabilities in State or local hospitals or medical centers.
Among States responding to the ASCA, only one State noted that persons with disabilities are housed in facilities
other than jails or prisons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The NPRM sought recommendations on the minimum number or percentage of general housing cells in correctional facilities
and holding cells in detention facilities that should be accessible.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A strong majority of the comments, most from State correctional agencies, recommended minimum percentages of either
one percent or two percent. The Illinois Department of Corrections, whose comments were supported by 22 States and
Puerto Rico, recommended a maximum of two percent scoping for general housing cells. A few comments recommended less
than one percent, and several commenters recommended either three, four, or five percent. The Bureau of Prisons recommended
that three percent of the cells be adaptable, which means that the cell can be easily converted to an accessible cell
when needed, but which is not fully accessible as part of new construction. Information provided by commenters on
existing State codes indicates that the minimum percentage among States varies, ranging from Washington State's
one percent to Wisconsin's five percent. The Florida Department of Corrections noted that its facilities are designed
so that two percent of the housing cells are accessible, which it considers adequate, if not excessive, for the determined
need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments concerning detention facilities, most at the local level, recommended one cell for each facility, such
as a police station, or recommended percentages of one or two percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board has specified in ADAAG 12.4.1(1) that a minimum of three percent, but not less than one, of holding or general
housing cells or rooms be accessible in new construction. This requirement is consistent with the recommendation
made by the Bureau of Prisons, although it had recommended adaptable, as opposed to fully accessible, cells. The Board
has not specified adaptable cells or rooms because it considers the concept of adaptability impractical in the jail
or prison environment. Even if adaptability were required, the clear floor space necessary for accessible cells
would most likely be provided as part of new construction due to the structural requirements of cells. Further, other
elements often provided as adaptable features in other types of facilities, such as grab bars, would most likely be
installed as part of construction so that they could be secured to the degree necessary in the prison environment.
A few commenters stated that while grab bars are easy to secure in new construction, to do so as an alteration or retrofit
may necessitate reconstruction of cell walls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three percent scoping requirement, which is slightly higher than the percentage recommended by a majority of
commenters, is also based on certain additional considerations. One consideration involves the aging of the prison
population and existing data demonstrating that the prevalence of disability increases with age. A few comments,
including one from a State disability agency, called attention to this consideration, but they did not provide any
survey data or documentation on the aging of the prison population. One State correctional authority commented:
``There are very few instances where the inmate's disability occurred while incarcerated *&blank;*&blank;* [but]
because of lengths of sentences, we are beginning to deal more and more with an aging population.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern stems from comments made on retrofit and alterations in detention and correctional occupancies.
These comments, which are further discussed below under ADAAG 12.4.5 (Alterations to Cells or Rooms), raised concerns
about the significant structural difficulties that exist in making existing jail or prison cells accessible. Consequently,
it is particularly essential that a sufficient level of access be provided in such occupancies as part of new construction.
A guideline that ensures that the need for accessible holding or general housing cells is met in new construction will
undoubtedly facilitate detention and corrections operators in fulfilling their obligations under the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dispersion of accessible cells is another issue of strong concern to many detention and corrections officials.
The Board indicated in the NPRM that it may require cells to be dispersed within facilities consistent with ADAAG requirements
for the integration of accessible spaces and elements. The concept of an integrated environment may be limited in
the restricted environment of prisons and jails. The NPRM sought information in this area in order to determine whether
dispersion of accessible cells or rooms was necessary or justified and, if so, to what degree. The NPRM asked questions
about dispersion within an entire facility and within individual housing units or buildings. A third level of dispersion,
raised by many corrections officials, concerned dispersion within an entire prison system at the State or local level.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many State and some local correctional officials felt that flexibility and discretion were necessary in determining
where inmates with disabilities are housed within a correctional system. It was recommended that these guidelines
take into account existing assignment policies or practices, including those that determine which facilities will
house inmates with disabilities. Some systems have certain locations or facilities which are considered more suitable
for such inmates because programs, services, supervision, and necessary medical treatment are more effectively
provided in some locations. Certain assignment policies could make it unlikely that an inmate with a disability will
be assigned to a specific facility, including one that is newly constructed. A corrections system may have a policy
of assigning persons with certain severe disabilities to a prison more fully served by, or in closer proximity to,
a major medical center. Representative of this concern was a comment from the City of New York indicating that its correctional
system already has or is in the process of constructing facilities that will accommodate inmates with disabilities.
They indicated that other facilities, including those that may be constructed in the future, should not be required
to provide accessible cells since inmates with disabilities will not be assigned to these locations under current
policy. Many of these commenters argued that accessibility should be addressed in regard to a city or State's correctional
system as a whole instead of at each building or facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board under its ADA mandate is responsible for developing a minimum level of accessibility in the construction
and alteration of buildings and facilities, including those of a detention or correctional system. The programs
and services of such a system lie beyond the Board's legislative mandate and the scope of these guidelines. This is
also true of a system's existing buildings and facilities, except in cases of alteration. As previously noted, the
operational aspects of State or local systems, and its existing buildings, are subject to regulations issued by the
Department of Justice. See 28 CFR part 35. Consistent with the ADA, the Department of Justice's regulations prohibit
discrimination on the basis of disability in a public entity's programs and services but may well afford some of the
flexibility and discretion desired by corrections operators in addressing accessibility through operational
or programmatic methods. Under its statutory authority, the Board finds that it can only address these concerns with
respect to the location of accessible cells in new construction or alterations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ADA and its legislative history require a level of accessibility in new construction that ensures that the features,
elements, and amenities of a facility are available to all, including persons with disabilities, in an integrated
setting. Thus, in developing ADAAG, the Board has sought to ensure that various facility elements and spaces are not
only accessible, but integral to the overall design. Similar requirements for integration are found in ADAAG requirements
pertaining to the dispersion of accessible seating in assembly areas, restaurants and cafeterias and accessible
rooms in transient lodging. The restricted environment of detention and correctional facilities may bring into
question the concept of an integrated setting with respect to accessibility, but it is an important principle of the
ADA. Consequently, the NPRM sought information on various issues critical in determining whether accessible cells
should be dispersed throughout a facility. A dispersion requirement was not proposed although the NPRM noted that
such a requirement might be included in the final rule. Since issues of safety and security may have bearing on the question
of dispersion, the NPRM also asked whether inmates with disabilities are generally at greater risk of violence in
the general population than are other inmates.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A majority of comments stated that inmates with disabilities could be at greater risk among the general population,
although many admitted to a lack of evidence or documentation to support this. Still, some of these comments argued
against any requirement to ``mainstream'' inmates with disabilities into the general population. On the other hand,
a significant number of comments, many from State corrections officials, stated that inmates with disabilities
are not considered to be less safe in the prison environment. It was noted that assessing an inmate's degree of safety
depends on a variety of factors and should not be based solely on disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM also asked whether inmates with disabilities present less of a security risk. A majority of the responses
felt that inmates could not be considered less of a security risk based solely on their physical condition or level
of disability. Assessing the potential threat to security, posed by inmates, must take into account other factors,
such as their personality and criminal history. Furthermore, some correctional authorities noted that inmates
with disabilities may present more of a threat to security since mobility aids may be used as weapons or to hide contraband.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment from the California Department of Corrections (CDC), is representative of many comments on safety and security
risks:

The CDC finds that disabled inmates are not necessarily at a greater risk. However, dependent upon their degree and
type of disability a security or safety problem could exist which places them in jeopardy .&blank;.&blank;. The Department
has not found that disabled inmates, as a whole, can be considered to be less of a security risk. Rather, the degree of
an individual inmate's security risk must be determined by classification on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration
the inmate's criminal history, commitment offense, individual case factors, medical/psychological history and
overall institutional behavior. Disabled inmates, although they may appear to be less of a security risk, have assaulted
staff and other inmates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to questions regarding safety and security risks, the NPRM asked whether accessible cells should be required
to be dispersed among all categories of housing or levels of security. The NPRM further asked whether housing of a certain
security level, such as maximum security, should be exempt from a requirement to contain accessible cells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the responses supported some kind of exception to a requirement for dispersion. Most of these comments,
represented by the Illinois Department of Corrections and the 22 States that endorsed its comments, supported an
exception that would be applicable to all categories of housing, not just maximum security areas. Several commenters,
including the Bureau of Prisons, supported an exception limited to maximum security. Support for an exception was
based on the supervision and safety of inmates with disabilities, effective provision of programs and services,
security, and cost. The Paralyzed Veterans of America regarded the importance of dispersion of accessible cells
as secondary to the safety of inmates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some corrections officials, as well as several State and local government agencies, local disability groups, and
a design professional supported a requirement for accessible cells in all categories or security levels. Since assumptions
on an inmate's safety or perceived risk to security cannot be made on disability alone, the California Department
of Corrections recommended that accessible cells be required among all categories of housing. Several State correctional
agencies in responding to the ASCA survey supported dispersion, including South Dakota which stated that: ``a majority
of inmates move to different classification levels over time, which necessitates accessibility at each level,''
and Kansas, which stated that: ``Inmates should be mainstreamed with the general population as much as possible.
Once the disabled inmates are released from prison they must interact with the general population in society.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments supported dispersion with respect to county or local facilities. The California Board of Corrections,
which oversees all city and county correctional agencies and facilities, surveyed operators of 11 county systems
and found that eight considered accessible cells necessary in all classification categories while three did not.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In view of recommendations from some correctional authorities that accessible cells be provided among all housing
categories or security levels, as well as the information received on safety and security issues concerning inmates
with disabilities, a provision has been added that requires accessible cells to be located in all categories or types
of cells. However, this requirement does not specify the amount or percentage that must be provided in each category
or security level. Dispersion is not required to be proportionate to the total number of cells in each category or security
level. Thus, at facilities with multiple levels of security, at least one accessible cell or room must be located in
each security level. For example, a 300-cell prison that is evenly divided into three categories or levels of security
would be required to have three percent or nine of its cells accessible with at least one accessible cell, not necessarily
three, in each security level; one cell could be provided in maximum security while the remaining eight could be distributed
among the other two security levels. However, this flexibility would not extend to those facilities comprised of
only one security level.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding local detention and correctional facilities, several commenters were concerned about the effect of dispersion
on small facilities. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice supported an exception based
not on security factors, but on facility size for temporary holding facilities in local jails. In Nebraska, three
housing separations are mandated for county facilities by code: male/female, adult/juvenile, and intoxicated/non-intoxicated.
In small holding facilities, dispersion among each holding category or classification would in many instances require
100 percent accessibility among cells, thus causing a disproportionate impact.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirement for the dispersion of accessible cells or rooms among all ``categories and types'' in ADAAG 12.4.1(2)
is required only to the extent possible under the minimum percentage required to be accessible for the facility overall.
The provision states that dispersion does not require an increase in the minimum three percent scoping specified
for the facility overall. For example, if a small jail is required under the three percent specification to have one
accessible cell, but has four holding classifications or ``types,'' only one accessible cell is required. An appendix
note clarifies that the minimum number required for the facility overall overrides the requirement for dispersion
among all categories or types of holding or housing cells.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked whether accessible cells should be required to be dispersed throughout individual housing units or
buildings that are of the same housing category or security level. A majority of responses to this question were against
dispersion of cells within a unit or building. This includes comments from individuals with disabilities, State
and local government agencies, correctional authorities, the Bureau of Prisons, several designers and associations.
Reasons given by commenters for not dispersing cells and allowing them to be clustered within a unit or building included:
safety of inmates with disabilities especially during emergency evacuation, more effective supervision of inmates
with disabilities, more efficient provision of programs and services including proximity of accessible cells to
certain common use areas, as well as cost and administrative benefits for prison operators. One correctional agency
noted that the inmates with disabilities interviewed preferred being housed in the same area as inmates with similar
disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several disability groups argued against an exception to dispersion. The Paralyzed Veterans of America, while urging
safety considerations over dispersion, also felt that there should be a firm test for an exception so that it functions
as an exception, not the rule. Otherwise, inmates with disabilities would be ``located in one cluster of cells or on
a designated tier, thereby effectively segregating them from the rest of the prisoner/inmate population.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reasons outlined by commenters for clustering cells make a compelling case for not requiring dispersion of accessible
cells among a building or housing unit. Unlike cells in different housing categories or security levels, those within
the same category or housing unit would most likely all share the same amenities or features. Consequently, a requirement
for the dispersion of accessible cells or rooms within buildings or housing units of the same category or security
level has not been included.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Detention and correctional facilities typically have cells used for special purposes such as protective custody,
disciplinary detention, detoxification, and medical isolation. Since inmates with disabilities might require
or need the services provided in these cells, it is essential that some of each type be accessible. The NPRM requested
additional information on these cells, including whether special housing cells should be held to the same level of
scoping as general housing cells.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A majority of commenters recommended using the same level of scoping as specified for general housing cells. Other
commenters recommended at least one of each type or one percent should be accessible. The Bureau of Prisons indicated
that it rarely places inmates with disabilities in such cells and recommended that only one such cell per institution
be required to be adaptable, not fully accessible.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The number of special housing cells required to be accessible is in addition to the three percent required for general
housing cells. In view of this and the fact that special housing cells are occupied for shorter periods of time, ADAAG
12.4.2 specifies that at least one special holding or housing cell serving each purpose be accessible in a facility.
However, constructing more than one of each type to be accessible will facilitate access at large facilities which
may have a number of each type serving different holding areas or housing units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked whether space and cost impacts of accessibility could be limited if one accessible cell served a variety
of special purposes. Some commenters, including a few prison operators and several disability groups, supported
the use of one cell for multiple purposes. One commenter indicated that small jail facilities usually have one cell
serving different uses such as protective custody, administrative segregation, and detoxification. However,
a majority of the comments, most from the operators of State correctional systems and designers, considered the idea
impractical if not infeasible. In some cases, for example, special housing cells may be located in different locations
of the facility according to their use.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is clear from the comments that using special housing cells for different uses may not be practical at all facilities,
especially those in State correctional systems. Since this may be a viable alternative in other facilities, and since
the period of stay in these cells is limited, ADAAG 12.4.2 notes that accessible special housing or holding cells may
serve more than one purpose. Where multiple use is not feasible, then at least one special housing or holding cell serving
each purpose is required to be accessible.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters questioned the need for such a requirement since holding or housing cells or rooms are rarely equipped
with telephones or alarms. They were concerned that alarms within cells may be vandalized or tampered with by inmates
or detainees. Moreover, since emergency evacuation is done under controlled or supervised circumstances, alarms
directly serving inmates or detainees are usually unnecessary.

 Many detention or correctional facilities may not have cells equipped with the type of devices, such as alarms and
permanently installed phones, that would trigger the requirements of ADAAG 12.6. The NPRM noted:

Generally, most correctional facilities do not provide these kinds of elements in cells, but some facility types,
such as minimum security prisons, may in fact be equipped with such devices. If permanently installed phones are provided
in one category of housing, the minimum number or percentage, if specified, would be based on the total number of cells
or rooms provided within that category of housing, not on the total number of cells or rooms of the facility. 57 FR 60632

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM asked for information on the number or percentage of persons with hearing impairments in detention and correctional
facilities. A number of State correctional authorities provided survey data with results that ranged from .01 percent
to 5 percent. Most figures, including several estimates, fell below 1 percent and the average among them was .65 percent.
At the local level, one corrections official indicated that .5 percent of jail inmates have hearing impairments,
and among county facilities, one State agency provided a figure of .10 percent. From its survey, the Bureau of Prisons
found that .5 percent of inmates within its system were identified as having a hearing impairment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two organizations provided information on studies that suggest that this percentage is considerably higher. According
to the National Center on Law and Deafness, ``[i]ndependent studies have identified from 8.9 to 47 percent of inmates
as having some degree of hearing impairment.'' The American Speech-Language Hearing Association stated that studies
place the range from between 15 to 50 percent depending on the age group, and that the prevalence of hearing, speech,
and language impairments is two to five times higher among the inmate population than among the general population.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information received from the comments does not account for the wide discrepancy between survey results submitted
by detention or correctional authorities and studies referenced by certain organizations. One reason may be a variable
working definition of hearing impairment used in different studies and surveys. Based on this information and considerations
that were taken into account with respect to fully accessible cells or rooms covered in ADAAG 12.4.1, ADAAG 12.4.3
requires that a minimum of three percent of holding or general housing cells or rooms be accessible to persons with
hearing impairments. This percentage, as noted in the appendix, is not based on the total number of cells or rooms provided
at a facility but on the total number of cells or rooms equipped with permanently installed telephones or audible emergency
warning systems. If cells or rooms of this type are not provided at a facility, the requirements of ADAAG 12.6 do not
apply. Additionally, this requirement only applies to housing or holding cells equipped with permanently installed
telephones or alarms. These elements are typically located in common use areas, such as dayrooms, instead of individual
cells. In this case, permanently installed telephones and alarms are required to be accessible according to ADAAG
requirements for common use areas. See ADAAG 12.1 and the appendix note at A12.4.3.

This section applies the requirements of ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities) to medical care facilities in detention
and correctional facilities. Facilities covered by ADAAG 6 are defined as those ``in which people receive physical
or medical treatment or care and where persons may need assistance in responding to an emergency and where the period
of stay may exceed twenty-four hours.'' ADAAG 12.4.4 is intended to address the same range of medical facilities covered
by ADAAG 6. Other medical facilities that do not meet this definition, such as physicians' offices, must be accessible
to the extent required for common use areas. ADAAG 6 contains scoping and technical requirements for patient bedrooms
and toilet rooms. Medical care facilities in detention and correctional facilities covered by ADAAG 12.4.4 are subject
to the scoping requirements of ADAAG 6.1. For example, ADAAG 6.1(1) requires that 10 percent of patient bedrooms be
accessible in certain facilities, including those used for detoxification. The patient bedrooms of a prison detoxification
unit would be subject to this 10 percent scoping requirement.

by the requirements of ADAAG 6. A majority of comments felt that further clarification was unnecessary and that the
requirement, as stated by the National Institute of Corrections, ``adequately addresses the kinds of medical facilities
found in detention and correctional facilities.'' Those comments recommending further clarification identified
specific types of medical facilities, such as first aid rooms, that are not clearly addressed by ADAAG 6.

 Those areas recommended for specific consideration, including first aid rooms, do not typically provide overnight
care or patient bedrooms and thus would not meet the definition of ``medical care facilities'' in ADAAG 6. Medical
care units not covered by ADAAG 6 would be considered common use areas and would be required to be accessible under ADAAG

 ADAAG 6.1 requires that in general purpose hospitals, psychiatric facilities, and detoxification facilities,
at least 10 percent of patient bedrooms shall be accessible. Several comments, including those from the Illinois
Department of Corrections, considered this scoping excessive for medical care facilities in detention and correctional
facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The minimum number of accessible patient bedrooms required in ADAAG 6.1 recognizes that the incidence of disability,
either permanent or temporary, is greater in medical care facilities. While information and survey data received
in this rulemaking suggests that the prevalence of disability is lower among the inmate population than the general
population, none was received indicating that the incidence of disability is lower in detention or correctional
medical care facilities. In fact, in view of certain existing policies of housing inmates with disabilities in infirmaries,
it may be greater. Consequently, the reference to ADAAG 6.1, which includes the 10 percent scoping requirement for
patient bedrooms, has been retained. One corrections official stated that the scoping requirements of ADAAG 6.1
are ``an affirmation of good architectural practice.''

 ADAAG 6.2 addresses entrances to medical care facilities and requires that at least one accessible entrance ``be
protected from the weather by canopy or roof overhang.'' In addition, this provision requires that such entrances
also be served by an accessible passenger loading zone. One State correctional agency indicated that canopy or roof
overhangs may compromise security by obstructing surveillance. This commenter further recommended an exception
for required clear floor space alongside beds in existing facilities and an exception allowing the location of toilet
and bathing facilities within patient cells instead of separate toilet or bathrooms.

 This provision has been revised to reference all sections of ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities) except ADAAG 6.2, which
requires canopy or roof overhangs. An exception has not been provided for clear floor space alongside beds in existing
facilities since these guidelines pertain only to new construction and alterations. In the case of an alteration,
the necessary clear floor space required in ADAAG 6.3 would be required only to the extent technically feasible. Regarding
the requirement in ADAAG 6.4 for accessible patient toilet rooms and bathrooms, the references to ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet
Rooms) and ADAAG 4.23 (Bathrooms, Bathing Facilities, and Shower Rooms) do not preclude placement of toilet or bathing
fixtures within patient cells or rooms as long as the requirements for toilet rooms and bathrooms, including maneuvering

 Special holding or housing cells required to be accessible by ADAAG 12.4.2 may include those used for purposes of medical
isolation. Since cells used for this purpose may be located within medical care facilities, the NPRM asked whether
they should be counted as part of, or in addition to, the number of patient bedrooms or cells required to accessible
under ADAAG 6. A majority of the responses to this question felt that medical isolation cells should be accessible
in addition to the percentage of patient bedrooms or cells required to be accessible by ADAAG 6. In fact, several comments
from corrections officials indicated that all medical isolation cells should be accessible.

 In view of the response to this question, language has been added to the provision and the appendix clarifying that
medical isolation cells required to be accessible by ADAAG 12.4.2 shall not be counted as part of the minimum number
of patient bedrooms or cells required to be accessible under ADAAG 6.1. Thus, if a medical care facility has both types
of cells, at least one medical isolation cell must be accessible under ADAAG 12.4.2 in addition to the number of patient
bedrooms or cells, in most cases 10 percent, required to be accessible by ADAAG 6.1. Consistent with the requirement
for special purpose cells in ADAAG 12.4.2, at least one medical isolation cell per facility is required to be accessible.
However, in view of the opinion expressed by some prison operators, it is recommended that consideration be given
to ensuring the accessibility of all medical isolation cells.

 Similar to a concern raised with respect to new construction, some State correctional agencies requested that the
guidelines be flexible in requiring accessible cells or rooms as part of an alteration. Some correctional systems
contain prisons that under current policies or assignment procedures are not intended to house persons with disabilities.

 The concern raised by corrections officials is understandable in light of current policies, but the underlying rationale
involves operational considerations, such as inmate placement and assignment procedures, that lie beyond the Board's
purview. As noted previously, the Board's statutory mandate requires a minimum level of accessibility in alterations
and new construction. Operators of correctional systems may question the practicality of making cells accessible
as part of an alteration at certain facilities not intended to house inmates with disabilities. However, the ADA and
its legislative history recognize alterations as opportunities for providing access. Such opportunities are to
be taken even in situations where the altered element or space may not be made fully accessible to or usable by persons
with disabilities. Further, additional alterations may eventually lead to full accessibility of an existing facility,
and, with respect to correctional systems, assignment policies may change. Such policies are subject to review by
the Department of Justice under title II of the ADA which prohibits discriminatory policies, practices, and procedures.

 In discussing requirements for accessible cells, various commenters expressed concern about compliance in cases
of alteration. For example, requirements for toilet and bathing facilities include specifications for grab bars.
Commenters indicated that grab bars may be properly mounted and secured to the degree necessary in new construction
but not necessarily as part of an alteration. In fact, one commenter noted that the proper securement of grab bars in
prison cells may actually necessitate reconstruction of cell walls.

 The concerns raised about specific requirements in cases of alteration involve issues already addressed by existing
provisions in ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations). ADAAG 4.1.6 states that where compliance is ``technically
infeasible, the alteration shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible.'' ``Technically infeasible,''

This section contains the minimum requirements for accessible cells or rooms. These requirements, which are similar
to those for holding cells in judicial facilities in ADAAG 11.4.2, are based in part on specifications in ADAAG 9 for
rooms in transient lodging. The NPRM asked whether any of these requirements, as proposed, conflicted with existing
security requirements inherent in cell design. Relatively few commenters responded to this question. Most comments
addressed requirements for doors in ADAAG 12.5.2(1) or responded to specific issues raised in the NPRM concerning
toilet and bathing facilities addressed in ADAAG 12.5.2(2) which are discussed below.

 In the NPRM, the requirements of ADAAG 12.5 were intended to apply to those elements or spaces that may be provided within
cells or in adjacent common use areas such as dayrooms. These requirements have been clarified to apply only to those
elements or spaces provided within housing or holding cells or rooms. Elements and spaces provided in common use areas,
such as dayrooms, are subject to ADAAG requirements for common use areas according to ADAAG 12.1.

This provision requires that all doors and doorways on an accessible route comply with ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). As proposed,
this requirement contained an exemption from the requirements for maneuvering clearances (4.13.6), door hardware
(4.13.9), opening force (4.13.11), and automatic or power-assisted operation (4.13.12) where detainees or inmates
are escorted by security personnel at all times.

 As discussed in ADAAG 11.4.2, corrections officials and several design professionals indicated that design requirements
may necessitate use of 300 to 500 pound doors. Such doors cannot meet the specification for closing and opening forces
in ADAAG 4.13.10 (Door Closers) and 4.13.11 (Door Opening Force) without, at a minimum, power-assist devices. In
addition, commenters noted that security requirements may prohibit the use of certain door hardware often used in
meeting the specifications for door hardware in ADAAG 4.13.9 (Door Hardware). Accessible door hardware, such as
lever handles, may be more easily removed than doorknobs and other types of door hardware.

 References to ADAAG 4.22 and 4.23 do not preclude the installation of either toilet or bathing fixtures within cells
as long as the specifications, including those for clear floor space, are met. These references clarify that the maneuvering
space and other requirements found in ADAAG 4.22 and 4.23 apply even if the room functions primarily as a housing or
holding cell. Since requirements for the cell itself, including necessary maneuvering space, may be used to meet
the maneuvering space required by ADAAG 4.22 or 4.23, these references do not have substantially greater impact than
do references to the specifications for specific fixtures. This is clarified in an appendix note to this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed under ADAAG 11.4.2, many holding and housing cells are equipped with a combination toilet and lavatory
unit. These combination units maximize space and are easier to install than separate fixtures. The NPRM asked whether
these type of units are actually required in cells and whether combination units that fully meet ADAAG requirements
are available.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several corrections officials indicated that they were unaware of any combination unit that fully complies with
ADAAG. Corrections officials of some States, such as California, Florida, and Michigan, noted that separate fixtures
are used in accessible cells. Manufacturers confirmed that the standard design of combination units, including
those otherwise considered accessible by the industry, do not fully meet ADAAG requirements. Specifically, the
standard design of these units cannot easily incorporate the 36 inch long rear grab bar required by ADAAG. Several
commenters, including a design firm, thought that it may be possible to install a grab bar of shorter length, perhaps
up to 24 to 26 inches, on some units. According to one correction official, however, mounting a 26 inch grab bar on the
unit would double the amount of space required and quadruple the cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several corrections agencies indicated that combination units are not required but are used frequently, primarily
because they require less space than separate fixtures. One design professional noted that their use is preferred
in police station holding cells for security reasons. The only source identified as actually requiring combination
units was Virginia's ``Guide of Minimum Standards in Design and Construction of Jail Facilities'' which requires
such units in maximum security cells.

 Based on the comments, it is apparent that the use of combination units are generally not required, but they are often
preferred for more efficient use of space and greater security. The requirement for toilet rooms complying with ADAAG
4.22 remains unchanged.

. One corrections official expressed concern about installing combination units that meet ADAAG specifications
or separate toilet and lavatory fixtures in existing cells as part of a renovation. Installation of these elements
would require converting two standard cells into one accessible cell in order to provide the necessary clear floor
space at fixtures.

. Structural conditions and site constraints that prohibit compliance with ADAAG in the case of alterations are addressed
by ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations). ADAAG 4.1.6 notes that where it is ``technically infeasible''
to comply with ADAAG as part of an alteration, compliance is only required ``to the maximum extent feasible.'' Compliance
with ADAAG that necessitates the removal of walls may constitute ``technical infeasibility'' in many cases. The
term ``technical infeasibility'' is further discussed under ADAAG 12.4.5 (Alterations to Cells or Rooms).

. The specifications for toilet rooms in ADAAG 4.22 and for bathing facilities in ADAAG 4.23 include requirements
for grab bars at toilets, showers, and tubs. In the prison environment, such elements must be properly secured so that
they cannot be removed and used as weapons. As discussed in ADAAG 11.4.2, the NPRM asked whether grab bars can be installed
without creating a security risk. A majority of comments, including those from corrections officials, indicated
that grab bars do not pose a risk to security if mounted properly. Several State corrections agencies offered certain
methods of securement, such as the use of steel imbeds. Some of these suggestions were qualified as being able to reduce,
but not necessarily eliminate, risks to security. Several commenters considered grab bars more of a security risk
in maximum security facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another question raised in the NPRM was whether grab bars can facilitate suicide attempts among inmates or detainees.
The NPRM asked about the experiences detention and correctional authorities have had with respect to grab bars and
suicide attempts. This issue was raised with respect to holding cells in judicial facilities covered by ADAAG 11.4.2
and to holding and housing cells in detention and correctional facilities addressed by this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. No information was received indicating that grab bars had indeed been used in any recorded suicide attempt. However,
the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives notes that this ``could have more to do with not only the problem
of under-reporting of jail suicides *&blank;*&blank;* but also the fact that grab bars are not yet predominantly
found in jails throughout the country.'' Several comments did consider grab bars a suicide risk, particularly in
police holding cells, maximum security cells, and psychiatric facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comments, however, particularly those from State corrections officials, indicated that while they may
pose some risk, suicide prevention cannot be based solely on cell design. Some comments considered it impossible
to design a cell that is ``suicide-free'' and noted that the risk posed by grab bars is not very different from the risk
already posed in many existing prisons or holding cells by cell grillage, bed frames, and air circulation vents. Many
of these commenters stressed the importance of appropriate supervision and classification of inmates and detainees
in curbing the risk of suicide. The California Board of Corrections, which oversees local and county facilities,
stated that:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
The best deterrent to such activity is staff supervision and appropriate classification of inmates to identify possible
suicide candidates. Another consideration is that grab bars are often located in open areas where staff visibility
is optimum. Finally, California requires grab bars adjacent to all water closets in detoxification cells due to the
potential for injury to intoxicated arrestees and there is no information to indicate an increase[d] suicide potential
in these cells due to grab bars.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The response from a majority of corrections officials indicates that supervision and classification of inmates
are necessary in preventing suicide. The operators of correctional facilities may rely on these methods since correctional
systems utilize extensive evaluation and classification of inmates. However, this may not be the case in detention
facilities which may house persons immediately after arrest. Information gathered by the Board indicates that,
in general, the chance of suicide is greatest during the first 24 or 48 hours following arrest. This is consistent with
the opinion expressed by a few commenters that the suicide risk is greater in detention facilities such as police station
holding cells. However, commenters indicated that appropriate supervision is necessary in these facilities in
order to effectively reduce the risk of suicide, especially since holding cells may already contain elements, such
as cell bars, that can facilitate suicide attempts. An exception to the requirement for grab bars in ADAAG 4.22 and
4.23 has not been included. The specifications for grab bars in ADAAG 4.26 (Handrails, Grab Bars, and Tub and Shower
Seats) allow various design alternatives, and some designs were suggested in the NPRM as possible alternatives.
These included grab bars that are recessed into the wall or that have infill welded plates attached to the bottom. Several
corrections officials stated that such designs may help reduce but would not necessarily eliminate the risk of suicide.
Further, they may compromise security by providing space in which contraband can be hidden. One State correctional
agency advised that operators ``should retain the flexibility of determining the grab bar design suitable for a particular
application.'' Current ADAAG specifications do provide some degree of flexibility in the design of grab bars. In
addition, ADAAG 2.2 (Equivalent Facilitation) allows departures from, or alternatives to, specific technical
requirements in ADAAG so long as equal or greater access is provided.

. One comment from an individual with a disability considered the clear floor space specified alongside beds to be
insufficient, while a corrections official considered the 36 inch width excessive and recommended that 32 inches
be the minimum. Further, this commenter felt that certain cell elements, such as writing desks and storage units,

. The 36 inch wide specification is based on requirements for patient bedrooms in ADAAG 6 (Medical Care Facilities).
This is in addition to the wheelchair turning space and connecting accessible route required for the cell. Clear floor
space required at fixed elements, such as writing desks, may overlap the maneuvering space required at beds; however,

. ADAAG specifies a range of 17 to 19 inches for the height of toilet seats and shower seats in order to facilitate the
necessary transfer. This height is appropriate for beds as well. However, determining this height for fixed beds
should include non-fixed elements such as bedding or mattresses so that the bed surface to which one transfers is within
the range of 17 to 19 inches from the finish floor. Where upper bunks are provided, the height of the beds is particularly
important in ensuring sufficient headroom for transfer. This information, including the recommended 17 to 19 inch
height for beds, has been added to the appendix.

ADAAG 12.6.1 requires that if audible emergency warning systems serving cells or rooms are provided, a visible alarm
complying with ADAAG 4.28.4 (Auxiliary Alarms) shall also be provided. Further, permanently installed telephones,
where provided within housing or holding cells or rooms, are required to have volume controls complying with ADAAG
4.31.5 (Hearing Aid Compatible and Volume Control Telephones). TTYs in detention and correctional facilities are
not addressed by this section but by requirements at ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(v). ADAAG 12.6 clarifies that portable devices
may be used in lieu of permanent devices if necessary wiring and outlets are provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed under ADAAG 12.4.3, some corrections officials, including the Bureau of Prisons, stated that such specifications
are unnecessary since the type of alarms and telephones addressed by this section are typically not provided in cells.
These comments further stated that supervision of inmates and controlled evacuations obviate the need for visible
alarms and that, since alarms may be vandalized or tampered with, their placement should not be required within cells.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These requirements, as stated in the corresponding scoping provision at ADAAG 12.4.3 and reiterated in this section,
apply only where alarms and permanently installed telephones are installed within housing or holding cells or rooms.
With respect to the need for alarms where evacuation of inmates is controlled, the proposed rule noted that visible
alarms are only required where ``inmates or detainees .&blank;.&blank;. are allowed independent means of egress.''
For clarity, this language has been restated as an actual exception to the requirement for visible alarms. Thus, where
independent egress is not allowed, visible alarms would not be required even if an audible emergency warning system
is provided. With respect to alarms being vandalized or tampered with, ADAAG 12.6.2 allows the use of portable, instead
of permanent, alarms as long as the necessary wiring and outlets are provided. Operators can then install portable
devices according to need as required by the Department of Justice title II regulation, which addresses the provision
of auxiliary aids and services. See 28 CFR part 35. This information is provided in an appendix note to ADAAG 12.6.2.

 An almost equal number of comments, primarily from disability groups and State and local government agencies, supported
these requirements. Some commenters recommended additional requirements, such as specifications for vibrating
alarms, signals of announcements or summons, and other notification devices.

 Auxiliary aids and devices, such as vibrating alarms are not within the purview of these guidelines since such devices
are typically not built-in or addressed as part of facility design and construction. Such devices, however, are not
precluded by these guidelines and, as noted above, are addressed by the Department of Justice title II regulation
as noted above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 13.1 outlines the types of residential facilities addressed by this section. These facilities include newly
constructed or altered single-family and multifamily dwelling units which are subject to title II of the ADA. The
term ``dwelling unit'' is defined in this section and has been incorporated here to apply only to residential housing
and not transient lodging. The term ``dwelling unit'' as used in ADAAG 13 specifically applies only to those facilities
used as a residence which contain rooms and spaces for living, bathing, and sleeping and may provide a kitchen or food
preparation area. An appendix note at A13.1 clarifies that this section does not obviate responsibility for compliance
with Federal laws such as the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C 3604 et seq.) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C 794). The appendix also discusses certain characteristics that distinguish residential dwelling
units addressed by this section from those considered transient lodging. Specifically, residential dwelling units
typically contain accommodations, including kitchens, bathrooms, living and sleeping areas. A discussion of the
definition of transient lodging is found in ADAAG 3.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADAAG 13 contains specific requirements for accessible residential housing which are in addition to those contained
in ADAAG 4.1 through 4.35. This section defines ``public use areas'' and ``common use areas.'' The definition of ``public
use area'' is consistent with ADAAG 3.5. The definition of ``common use area'' is consistent with the definition in
ADAAG 3.5, but is more specific to residential facilities covered by this section and applies to rooms, spaces or elements
used by residents or their guests, such as hallways, lounges, lobbies, laundry rooms, refuse rooms, mail rooms, storage
facilities, areas used for official functions, recreational areas and passageways among and between buildings.
The term ``common use'' excludes spaces wholly within a dwelling unit. An appendix note has been added to clarify this
requirement. An exception provides that elevators are not required in residential facilities that are less than
four stories if the requirements of 13.1(2), 13.2 and 13.3 are met. A second exception has been included for common
use areas that serve a recreational purpose. Under this exception, where multiple recreational facilities, such
as tennis courts, are provided, at least one of each type must be accessible. An appendix note encourages that a sufficient
number of accessible multiple common use recreation facilities should be provided to ensure equitable opportunities
for persons with disabilities.

 A commenter asked whether a facility which provides a single room occupancy, is a dwelling unit. The commenter noted
that meals are provided on a congregate basis at these facilities, if at all. Other commenters, including some colleges
and universities, requested a clarification as to whether the accommodations they provide are dwelling units or
transient lodging.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where a tenant rents only a sleeping room on a transient basis it is not a dwelling unit as defined in ADAAG 13. Some sleeping
rooms have modest food storage facilities. However, these rooms are not generally intended to be dwelling units.
Such accommodations are more similar to hotels and motels and if so, would be considered transient lodging subject
to ADAAG 9 (Accessible Transient Lodging). Language has been added to ADAAG 13.1 which states that this section does
not apply to transient lodging. An appendix note makes it clear that other residential housing for live-in employees
or apartments for students would be covered by ADAAG 13.1 if they contain dwelling units as defined by this section.

 A large number of commenters including, the Camden County Office for the Disabled, the State of Washington Building
Code Council, the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, the Montgomery County, (Maryland)
Housing Opportunities Commission and, the State of New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, expressed concern
regarding the application of these guidelines to single-family dwelling units constructed or altered ``by or on
behalf of'' a State or local government entity. New Jersey noted that ``this requirement would have an adverse impact
on governmental single-family housing programs that include low rate mortgages, zero down payment, closing cost
assistance, and construction financing to developers of for-sale single-family homes.'' Other commenters supported
coverage of single-family residences such as official residences, those provided for governors and State university
presidents, and single-family housing provided as public housing. The City of Chicago Mayor's Office commented
``The fact that the ATBCB guidelines now require State and local governments to apply access standards to single-family
dwellings is highly commendable.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 202 of the ADA prohibits public entities from discriminating on the basis of disability. ``Public entity''
includes any State or local government, any department, agency, special purpose district, or instrumentality of
a State or local government. See 42 U.S.C. 12131 and 12132. Thus, facilities which are subject to title II of the ADA
are covered by these guidelines. Single-family dwellings such as a president's house at a university are included
in this definition and such dwellings are addressed in these guidelines. This provision has been revised to indicate
that these guidelines apply to residential housing subject to title II of the ADA.

The NPRM asked whether an exemption for National Guard facilities and other similar dwelling units in addition to
dwelling units for unaccompanied personnel should be included. The majority of commenters did not support such an
exception. A few suggested that the Board might contemplate an exemption if there was clear linkage between employee
job descriptions which preclude persons with disabilities and employee housing. One State's department of fish
and game requested an exemption for very remote cabins and dwellings used by seasonal employees. They stated:

*&blank;*&blank;* the nature of the work at these remote sites is such that employees must be `able-bodied' *&blank;*&blank;*

A number of commenters, including the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, the State of
Hawaii Architectural Access Committee, and the City of New York, opposed such an exemption since the facility occupancy
and use may change. The Hawaii Commission for People with Disabilities and the Kentucky Office of the Governor both
pointed out that National Guard facilities are used to house the general public in the event of a disaster and neither
supported an exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines do not contain an exemption for National Guard housing facilities or other similar dwelling units
for unaccompanied personnel. The majority of the commenters did not support such an exception. Several commenters
pointed out that in times of disaster, these facilities are used to shelter or provide other assistance to the public.
This is a compelling reason to require accessibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Board has not provided any exceptions based on the presumed physical capabilities of building
occupants or employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), commented that such exceptions may
be inconsistent with title I of the ADA as it pertains to access for employees with disabilities. Title I of the ADA states
that employers must accommodate employees with disabilities unless doing so would impose an undue hardship. Issues
relating to other exceptions are further discussed in relation to ADAAG 4.1.1(5) (General Exceptions).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters, including the University of California and the National Association of Home Builders suggested
that in lieu of the proposed rule, the Board should adopt the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines issued by Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) pursuant to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 3604 et seq.). Commenters
were concerned that overlapping federal guidelines would cause confusion among facility owners and developers.
The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs suggested that the Board adopt ``the reasonable and effective approach''
in the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). A number of commenters including the Disability Rights Education
and Defense Fund (DREDF) and the World Institute on Disability strongly supported the proposed rule. DREDF commented:
``It is highly commendable that the Board has chosen to apply ADAAG and UFAS to housing for its basic requirements *&blank;*&blank;*
This approach must remain unchanged in the final standards.''

Nothing in ADAAG 13 obviates the necessity for compliance with the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines. This section,
although generally more stringent than the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, is compatible with those guidelines.
Furthermore, this section is consistent with standards referenced by HUD's regulations implementing section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) which reference UFAS (24 CFR 8.32). A discussion of the relationships
between these regulations and their applicable standards is contained in the NPRM. (See 57 FR 60633).

The NPRM asked if an exception should be included similar to that in UFAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for elevators in low-rise structures. The NPRM did not include such an exception. UFAS 4.1.3(1) provides that all
the accessible dwelling units may be located on one accessible level if at least one of each type of common area and amenity
provided for use of residents and visitors is available on the accessible level. Most commenters supported such an
exception. They noted that certain model building codes require elevators in multifamily structures that are four
stories or more. These commenters also cited cost and maintenance factors as reasons for supporting an exception.
The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association noted that the cost of each elevator provided in a three story walk-up
apartment would approximate the cost of one dwelling unit, potentially resulting in the construction of fewer units.
If elevators are required in low-rise residential facilities, the National Association of State Facilities Administrators
expressed concern that ``*&blank;*&blank;* public sector housing could lose much of its cost advantage over exempt
private sector housing, driving designs back to high density, high rise dwellings.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters objected to an elevator exception on the basis of ensuring integration, security, and choice for
people with disabilities. One commenter strongly urged that smaller facilities be required to have an elevator since
the trend in development of publicly owned housing is toward smaller facilities. Otherwise, the commenter reasoned,
accessible units will be provided only on the ground floor in smaller facilities. Ground floor units, according to
several other commenters are more susceptible to burglary and other criminal activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the commenters who favored an elevator exception suggested that it should be narrowly drawn so as not to include
larger buildings. In the interest of integration, the City of New York offered a compromise provision under which
buildings with less than twenty-five dwelling units would not be required to have an elevator.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the concerns for greater choice and integration are very important, requiring elevators in low-rise residential
facilities is likely to result in fewer affordable dwelling units due to the added cost. The Board is well aware of the
problems of all homeless persons, including those with disabilities. While elevators facilitate integration,
there are associated costs. Requiring elevators in smaller buildings will force redesign of the typical walk-up
garden apartment building, and the capital cost for each elevator is roughly equivalent to one dwelling unit. Balancing
social goals and economic realities benefits all homeless people. Therefore, a provision has been added to ADAAG
13.1(2) exempting residential facilities that are less than four stories from the requirement for an elevator, provided
that the requirements of ADAAG 13.1(2) (Public and Common Use), 13.2 (Minimum Number and Dispersion) and 13.3 (Requirements
for Accessible Dwelling Units) are satisfied. An elevator may be required if the requirements of ADAAG 13.1(2), 13.2
and 13.3 cannot be met without providing vertical access. For example, in a facility having only one building, a designer
may elect to locate all one bedroom units on the first floor and all two bedroom units on the second floor. In this case,
if more than one accessible dwelling unit is required, an elevator may be necessary to meet the dispersion requirements
in ADAAG 13.2.2. This exception does not decrease the minimum number of dwelling units that must be accessible in a
facility.

The proposed rule has been revised by deleting the term ``public use'' so that all newly constructed and altered recreational
facilities for use by the general public must comply with ADAAG 4. In addition, at least one of each type of common use
recreational facility provided must be accessible. This provision is written to be consistent with the Fair Housing
Accessibility Guidelines which state: ``Where multiple recreational facilities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

one accessible recreational facility may be insufficient to ensure equitable opportunity by persons with disabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on a common site) shall comply with ADAAG 13.3 and 13.4. In a facility with more than two dwelling units, 25 percent,
but not less than one of the accessible units complying with ADAAG 13.3 and 13.4, shall have a roll-in shower. In addition,
where special purpose residences are provided for specific employee positions and are not interchangeable (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Governor's mansions and university President's residences) each shall comply with 13.2.1(1). Where special purpose
residences are interchangeable, five percent, or at least one shall be accessible. Examples of special purpose residences
that are interchangeable include, but are not limited to, housing set aside for university faculty having similar
rank and live-in residences for museum curators and other professional staff. In addition to these units, two percent
of the total number of dwelling units in a facility shall comply with ADAAG 13.4. This section also provides that, when
the total number of dwelling units is one, that dwelling unit shall meet the requirements of ADAAG 13.2.1(1). An appendix
note clarifies that at least one of each type of unit size, according to the number of bedrooms provided must be accessible
according to 13.2.2(2). Even when the minimum number requirements of 13.2.1 must be exceeded, access to all types
of units, particularly according to the number of bedrooms provided, will ensure a minimum level of program access
and may reduce future costs associated with accommodating individuals with varying needs. Because existing units
can be made accessible to persons with hearing impairments with little or no structural alteration, a similar provision
is not included for those units required to be accessible by 13.2.1(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM asked whether the scoping provisions were appropriate and sought any information or survey results on the
need for accessible units in existing residential facilities which are owned or operated by State or local governments,
especially those that have complied with UFAS. Although a number of commenters supported the provision, many requested
an increase in the percentages specified at ADAAG 13.3.2(1). The City of New York recommended 8.5 percent accessible
dwelling units for New York based on recent census data. DREDF, Independent Housing Services of San Francisco, California,
and others recommended ten percent accessible dwelling units under ADAAG 13.3.2(1). Conversely, a few commenters
took the position that even five percent accessible dwelling units is too great a burden. The City of Boston, Public
Facilities Department reported that where data are available, the demand has consistently been between two and three
percent. They noted that accessible housing is not always occupied by people with disabilities and that the demand
does not support the five percent requirement. On the other hand, a number of commenters suggested that a lack of outreach
to people with disabilities was the reason for low occupancy rates of accessible units by persons with disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to ADAAG 13.3.2(2), the National Center for Law and Deafness pointed out that the two percent scoping
for dwelling units accessible to persons with hearing impairments was less than the scoping for transient lodging.

The requirement for five percent accessible dwelling units, is consistent with the requirements of HUD's regulation
implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for multifamily facilities. Also, the legislative history
of the ADA directs the Board not to set lesser accessibility requirements than those included in the Minimum Guidelines
and Requirements for Accessible Design (MGRAD). H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt. 2, at 139. MGRAD requires five percent
of the total number of units of a facility, or at least one dwelling unit, whichever is greater, to be accessible. See

As with ADAAG 9.1.3 (Sleeping Accommodations for Persons with Hearing Impairments), some dwelling units are required
to be accessible only to persons with hearing impairments. Where possible, consistency with HUD's section 504 regulation
is preserved. HUD's regulation requires that an additional two percent of the dwelling units be ``accessible for
persons with hearing or vision impairments.'' See 24 CFR 8.22.

The NPRM requested comment on the percentage of roll-in showers that should be required. In addition, the NPRM asked
whether the requirement for roll-in showers in residential housing should parallel the provision for transient
lodging found in ADAAG 9.1.2. The majority of the commenters supported a requirement for roll-in showers. While some
commenters such as the City of Pasadena, California suggested that most persons with disabilities do not prefer roll-in
showers, commenters in support of requiring roll-in showers noted that roll-in showers allow greater independence
and may be used by a wide range of persons. A few commenters raised concerns that roll-in showers might cause water damage
if improperly drained. Suggestions for scoping ranged from no scoping to one hundred percent of the accessible units
in a facility. Most of those who recommended roll-in showers supported requiring 25 percent of the accessible dwelling
units have roll-in showers. Regarding whether the scoping should parallel that for transient lodging, there was
clear consensus for applying the requirement for roll-in showers to facilities with fewer than fifty dwelling units.
However, a number of commenters noted that a facility having one single-family dwelling unit should not be required
to provide a roll-in shower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines do not apply the requirement for roll-in showers to facilities having only one or two dwelling units.
Doing so might cause these facilities to be less desirable to persons who have a need or preference for a bathtub. In
a facility with more than two dwelling units, requiring a roll-in shower to be provided in only 25 percent of the dwelling
units complying with ADAAG 13.2.1(1) means that a facility must have more than 80 dwelling units before a second roll-in
shower is required. For example, a facility with 81 dwelling units is required to have five percent accessible units,
which is five. Therefore, of these five accessible units, 25 percent, or two, must have a roll-in shower. The provision
is similar to ADAAG 9.1.2 (Accessible Units, Sleeping Rooms and Suites) in that only very large facilities are required
to have more than one roll-in shower. It differs in that the requirement for at least one roll-in shower applies to smaller
facilities. As for the issue of water damage caused by improperly drained roll-in showers, roll-in showers can be
designed, installed, and maintained without presenting such drainage problems.

The NPRM asked whether a provision for bathtubs complying with ADAAG 4.20 should be included. The NPRM also asked what
percentage of a facility's accessible dwelling units should contain such bathtubs. There was no clear consensus
among commenters regarding the need for accessible bathtubs. Percentages suggested by commenters ranged from zero
to fifty. A number of commenters noted that bathtubs are particularly useful to persons needing to immerse joints
and muscles. A very few commenters suggested that the guidelines require a particular adaptable tub which can be made
into a roll-in shower. One commenter pointed out that adaptable dwelling units which are covered by the Fair Housing
Amendments Act are likely to have bathtubs.

Experience suggests that roll-in showers are not provided unless they are required. Where roll-in showers are not
provided in accessible units, accessible bathtubs or accessible shower stalls are required by ADAAG 13.3.2(11).
Further, adaptable dwelling units covered under the Fair Housing Amendments Act are likely to have bathtubs and are
required to have support for grab bars. Therefore a specific scoping provision for bathtubs is viewed to be unnecessary.

The NPRM asked whether basing the minimum number of accessible dwelling units on the number of dwelling units in each
``facility'' is the most appropriate means of determining an adequate level of accessibility. A very few commenters
recommended that each building in a facility or on a site should have accessible units. Most commenters recommended
using ``facility.'' Some preferred ``site'' because they believed that use of that term would affect dispersion
of accessible dwelling units giving the designer more flexibility in determining the location of required accessible
dwelling units within a facility. A few commenters recommended scoping according to dwelling units owned by a State
or local government and used for a specific program. Most of these commenters were concerned that scattered site single-family
housing which is used for certain social service programs such as residential group homes would be required to be one
hundred percent accessible. Although many noted that they did not oppose such a scoping requirement for new construction,
they were concerned that accessibility requirements, when applied to renovated or existing housing, would be cost
prohibitive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 3.5 defines ``facility'' as ``[a]ll or any portion of buildings, structures, site improvements, complexes,
equipment, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property located on a site.'' The term
``site'' is defined at ADAAG 3.5 as ``[a] parcel of land bounded by a property line or a designated portion of a public
right of way.'' Given that these definitions are so similar, there is no rationale for departing from the use of ``facility''
when referring to buildings on a single parcel of land. A change from ``facility'' to ``site'' would not affect the
dispersion of accessible dwelling units.

13.2.2&blank;New Construction: Dispersion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This provision requires that accessible dwelling units be dispersed throughout a facility so as to provide people
with disabilities the housing choices comparable to and integrated with those available to other members of the public.
The provision also requires certain factors to be considered when dispersing accessible units. These factors include:
vertical dispersion in buildings where elevators are provided; unit size; rental or sale price; amenities provided
within dwelling units; and the availability and proximity of amenities serving dwelling units. In addition, when
units of different size in terms of number of bedrooms are provided, at least one of each such unit must be accessible.
This provision may necessitate that the minimum number of units required to be accessible by 13.2.1(1) be exceeded.
Additionally, if the minimum number has not been met, units shall be dispersed throughout the facility according
to the number of bedrooms provided to the maximum extent feasible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM asked whether there were overriding factors which are more significant than a dispersed location for certain
types of facilities. Commenters were also asked whether accessible units should be located close to entrances, amenities
such as parking, or common use areas. Most commenters supported the dispersion provisions included in this section.
They expressed a number of preferences for the location of accessible units including: proximity to parking, recreation,
and laundry facilities; more secure areas; and more remote and secluded areas. A few commenters noted that clustering
accessible units in large facilities with centrally located amenities may be preferable to dispersing them in a manner
that would not necessarily provide greater geographic separation between units but would result in great travel
distances to those amenities for some occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters were concerned that dispersion according to unit configuration would force construction of accessible
multi-story dwelling units where multi-story units such as townhouses are provided. Similarly, others were concerned
that a requirement for dispersion according to configuration would be interpreted strictly and that accessible
units would be required to have exactly the same footprint as inaccessible units.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed requirement that units be dispersed according to configuration has been deleted. Multi-story dwelling
unit construction is not uncommon and dispersion according to unit configuration could limit viable design solutions
such as constructing one ``flat'' unit between two multi-story units. Provided that the single-story unit includes
the same elements and spaces as the multi-story unit, it is an acceptable design. In light of commenters' diverse preferences,
especially concerning the location of accessible dwelling units, the guidelines generally do not limit or restrict
the method used to achieve dispersion except that vertical dispersion must be considered in elevator buildings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ADAAG 13.2.3(1) provides that the minimum number of dwelling units required to be accessible be based on the requirements
of 13.2.1 in relation to the total number of units being altered. This requirement remains in effect and applies to
each subsequent alteration until such time as the total number of accessible dwelling units required by ADAAG 13.2.1
for the entire facility is achieved. An appendix note illustrates this requirement. ADAAG 13.2.3(2) takes into account
that existing conditions or the scope of the alteration may limit full dispersion of accessible units throughout
the facility. This provision only requires altered units that are made accessible to be dispersed to the maximum extent
feasible in accordance with ADAAG 13.2.2. An appendix note clarifies that merely replacing an oven is not generally
considered an alteration, unless the oven in an accessible apartment is replaced. In that case, the oven must meet
the requirements of ADAAG 13.3.4(7) (Ovens).

Few comments were received for this section. Most of the commenters were concerned with the application of these guidelines
to renovation of older existing single-family dwellings. The State of New York Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental
Disabilities noted that accessible features ``result in an `institutional looking' home''. They were concerned
that such homes would not serve the goal of community integration of people with developmental disabilities. Further,
some commenters expressed concern that the cost of complying with these guidelines would limit the selection of homes
purchased for renovation. A commenter requested assurance that the provisions of ADAAG 4.1.7 are applicable to renovations
of historic properties such as a governor's residence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
References in this provision to proposed ADAAG 13.5 (Dwelling Units Accessible to Persons with Vision Impairments)
have been removed because that reserved section has been deleted. As regards aesthetics, application of these guidelines
does not necessarily result in institutional looking facilities. Architects and designers have demonstrated the
ability to incorporate accessible features in a manner that reflects the overall style of the neighboring community.
A number of factors must be considered in the selection of homes purchased for renovation. Although certain styles
of existing dwellings lend themselves more readily to renovations for accessibility, ADAAG contains no requirement
that these be selected. In fact, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) contains an exception from full compliance with these guidelines
if alteration work is technically infeasible. Additionally, the Department of Justice regulations implementing
title II of the ADA require that alterations to each facility covered under title II be made in a manner that the facility
is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, to the maximum extent feasible. See 28 CFR 35.151(b).
Renovation of historic properties is covered in ADAAG 4.1.7.

The NPRM asked whether the guidelines should include a requirement for accessible van parking and a requirement that
every accessible parking space in tenant lots be van accessible. Most commenters supported a requirement for tenant
parking spaces to be one hundred percent accessible to tenants driving vans. A few suggested a lower percentage. The
Minnesota Council on Disability recommended providing van parking for every dwelling unit having a roll-in shower.
Others, including the National Parking Association, suggested that an adjacent parking space might be used as an
access aisle for a van if needed by a tenant. The National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards and a
few other commenters supported the existing scoping for van parking at ADAAG 4.1.2(5)(b).

The NPRM asked whether it should specify the universal parking space design or the van accessible type for tenant parking.
Responses were divided among the two options. Very little cost data or other information was provided for the choices
selected. The Illinois Department of Rehabilitation Services reported that accessible parking spaces in Illinois

ADAAG permits a designer to elect to provide a combination of accessible car and van spaces or universal design parking
spaces. As commenters were so divided regarding design choices, and because some States and localities have established
code requirements consistent with existing ADAAG, the guidelines do not limit the options, but have retained the
flexibility of choosing which design option is preferred.

One commenter was concerned that signs identifying accessible parking spaces would expose tenants to greater risk
of crime. The commenter noted that signs which identify spaces by apartment or other identification number would
serve the same purpose as those which identify accessible reserved spaces since they both restrict parking by unauthorized
people.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is possible that signs designating spaces as reserved for particular units are as effective as those signs which
indicate that spaces are reserved for accessible parking only. However, many States and localities strictly enforce
violations of properly designated accessible spaces and law enforcement personnel may find it more difficult to
control misuse of spaces merely reserved for tenants. Regarding concerns that parking signs will increase the potential
for crime, accessible spaces are configured differently from inaccessible spaces and there already is an indication
that the space serves an accessible dwelling unit. For these reasons, signs are required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters generally supported requiring elevators in public spaces to comply with ADAAG 4.10. However, with regard
to a means of accessing different levels within a dwelling unit, a number of commenters noted that they find platform
lifts undesirable. Most objected to their use in new construction. The California Department of Rehabilitation
noted that lifts should not be allowed in new construction and that there are other alternatives such as elevators
and ramps. In addition, EPVA objected to viewing platform lifts used in lieu of an elevator complying with ADAAG 4.10
as ``equivalent facilitation.'' They noted, however that ``. . . economic and space constraints suggest equivalent
facilitation can be provided within individual dwelling units by private residence elevators *&blank;*&blank;*''
No commenters suggested that an elevator complying with ADAAG 4.10 should be required within a single dwelling unit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The use of platform lifts in dwelling units is consistent with the limited circumstances in which they may be used in
other types of facilities addressed in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) EXCEPTION 4. However, accessible private residence elevators
are also a viable design alternative for dwelling units. Application of each of the exceptions must be considered
carefully during the design of the dwelling unit. For example, inclined platform lifts may not reduce the width of
an exit stair and their use may greatly increase the space consumed by a stair complying with State and local codes.
Alternatively, private residence elevators may require less square footage. Generally, the initial costs of platform
lifts are lower than those of accessible private residence elevators. Finally, applicable State and local codes
should be considered when selecting a means of vertical access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to commenters' concerns regarding the equivalent facilitation provision in the NPRM, ADAAG 2.2 does
not invite elements to be used in lieu of other required elements unless they provide equal or greater access. For this
reason, the provision allowing platform lifts has been revised and is included as an exception. The new text permitting
accessible private residence elevators is also an exception to this provision because elevators complying with
ADAAG 4.10 are designed for public, not residential, use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were few comments on this provision. Of the comments received, the majority supported requiring all of the entrances
to be accessible. An architect noted that the guidelines should specify that the accessible entrance be the ``primary''
entrance to the dwelling unit. Independent Housing Services of San Francisco, California supported requiring all
entrances to be accessible, unless technically infeasible. One commenter indicated that a dwelling unit with only
one means of egress is a fire hazard.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Entrances to dwelling units usually serve as means of egress. An appendix note at A13.3.2 indicates that a second means
of egress from a dwelling unit is recommended for emergency evacuation purposes. In addition, language has been added
to this provision indicating that additional entrances, where provided, should be accessible. This does not require
these additional entrances to be accessible, but rather urges designers to consider both the safety and convenience
of residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A requirement that all entrances be accessible may be extremely costly. For example, the designer of a single-family
dwelling unit may wish to access a basement from the exterior by a flight of stairs. In this example, the designer might
have to forego an exterior entrance to the basement. A multifamily dwelling unit may have a secondary entrance or exit
from the kitchen. If this secondary entrance is required to be accessible, a latch side clearance of eighteen inches
is required adjacent to a door with a 32 inch clear width. In this example, a galley kitchen might have to be significantly
wider than planned due to the added requirement for latch side clearance. As for technical infeasibility, this term
applies only to alterations, not new construction. Technical infeasibility is very narrowly applied to existing
structural or site constraints.

 EPVA recommended that the guidelines permit inaccessible redundant controls such as switches for range hoods. They
noted that certain building codes require range hood switches to be built into the unit face. In addition, they suggested
that the guidelines specify that circuit breaker panels are ``controls'' as defined by this provision.

 Redundant controls are permitted so that certain building codes are not violated by these guidelines. Additionally,
electric circuit breaker panels are controls that must be accessible. The interim final guidelines have been amended

 The NPRM proposed to require auxiliary visible alarms complying with ADAAG 4.28.4. The National Center for Law and
Deafness urged consideration of the fact that single station alarms, including smoke detectors, generally are provided
in residential dwelling units. They suggested that the provisions of ADAAG 4.28.3 which address both single station
alarms and building-wide systems are more appropriate for this section. They noted that the term ``auxiliary visible
alarm'' implies that the alarm appliance is used in conjunction with or to supplement a building's alarm system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Auxiliary visible alarms are used more appropriately to supplement another alarm system. They have particular characteristics
that make them desirable in sleeping rooms in transient lodging facilities where the room occupant is presumed to
be asleep during much of the time the room is occupied. This, however, is not the case in residential dwelling units
where persons are awake much of the time. For this reason, the section is revised to reference ADAAG 4.28.3 (Visible
Alarms). In addition, reference to single station alarms has been removed from this provision because ADAAG 4.28.3
covers both building-wide alarm systems and single station alarms which are not integrated into a building's alarm
system. There appears to be some confusion regarding the difference between an emergency warning system and a building-wide
alarm. Both a building-wide alarm system and an individual single station alarm are considered emergency warning
systems and providing either would require compliance with this provision.

 With respect to new construction of certain multifamily housing, ADAAG overlaps the requirements of the Fair Housing
Accessibility Guidelines. Those guidelines address requirements for an accessible route into and through the covered
dwelling unit. See 24 CFR 100.205. Elements and spaces which are addressed in ADAAG meet or exceed the requirements
of the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines. Accessible living spaces should be designed to provide the required
clearances when the dwelling unit is furnished. For example, the required accessible route in a master bedroom should
not be obstructed by a full size bed. In addition, the design of the unit will, to a great degree, dictate furniture placement.
If no wall space accommodates a sofa or couch in a living room due to the placement of doors then the furniture may, of
necessity, obstruct maneuvering clearances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM proposed a provision based on ADAAG 4.22.2 that would prohibit the door swing from intruding on clear floor
space required for any fixture. A number of commenters opposed this requirement based on the rationale that bathrooms
in dwelling units are for individual use. They reasoned that the additional space required to accommodate a door swing
outside of the clear floor space could be as much as twelve square feet. Several commenters noted that the ANSI A117.1&hyph;1992
standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings allows the door to swing into the clear floor space in single user toilet
rooms provided that maneuvering clearance is provided beyond the arc of the door swing. One commenter believed that
in order to reduce costs, a person using a wheelchair or other mobility device should back out of a residential bathroom.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board agrees that fixtures in residential bathrooms are still usable if doors are permitted to swing into the required
clear floor space. However, residents with disabilities should not be required to back out of their bathrooms. This
would require that they must use the facility with the door open. Permitting this design alternative would constitute
an intrusion into the privacy of individuals with disabilities. In order to facilitate a turn within the bathroom,
and to accommodate commenters' concerns, the original language in the NPRM prohibiting doors from swinging into
required clear floor space has been revised. The new language is consistent with ANSI A117.1&hyph;1992 section 4.16.2
in that the arc of the door swing may overlap required clear floor space at fixtures as long as it does not intrude into
required maneuvering clearance within the room. This change allows greater flexibility in the layout of a residential
bathroom and does not greatly compromise its usability.

 Language has been added to clarify that a U-shaped kitchen is a closed end space having fixtures, storage or other usable
elements on three sides. A kitchen that is open at both ends, or, closed at one end which has no fixtures, storage, or
other usable elements at the closed end is not a U-shaped kitchen. In a U-shaped kitchen, a person will need a 60 inch
clear floor space for maneuvering between elements located on three sides of a kitchen, while a T-turn should provide
sufficient maneuvering space if elements are only located on two sides.

This provision requires clear floor space that allows either a forward or a parallel approach at fixtures and appliances
in the kitchen, including, but not limited to, the range or cooktop, oven, refrigerator/freezer, dishwasher, and
trash compactor. The provision also requires that sinks shall have a forward approach. The provision also requires
that laundry equipment located in the kitchen comply with ADAAG 13.3.5.

 Very few comments were received on this provision, however, an architect noted that some of the dimensions are redundant.
The commenter felt that dimensions should not be repeated unless they are ``an exception to the referenced standard.''
Also, it was noted that sinks should be required to have a forward approach. In addition, the commenter noted that the
requirement for maneuvering space in compliance with ADAAG 4.2.3 duplicates requirements already stated in ADAAG
13.3.2(2). The commenter recommended that redundant provisions be deleted.

 Some redundancy is necessary as it is not uncommon for requirements for maneuvering space to be overlooked. However,
repeating the dimensions along with the referenced section is unnecessary and the provision has been changed accordingly.
Further, language has been added to clarify that accessible sinks must have a forward approach.

 An architect requested that the guidelines clarify that the provision also applies to kitchen fixtures. In addition,
the commenter recommended adding a number of fixtures to the list with an indication that the list of fixtures and appliances
is not exhaustive.

 The guidelines have been revised to add ``fixtures'' to the requirement and indicate that the list is not exhaustive.
Counter work surfaces and sinks have not been added to the list because both require knee clearance for a front approach.
This provision allows either a front or parallel approach. Adding kitchen sink or work surfaces to this provision
might be interpreted to mean that knee clearance is not required at sinks or work surfaces. See ADAAG 13.3.4(4) and
ADAAG 13.3.4(5).

 This provision requires at least one 36 inch section of a counter for an accessible work surface. The provision allows
the accessible work surface to be either adjustable within a range from 28 to 36 inches or mounted at a fixed height not
exceeding 34 inches. It also requires that the counter thickness and supporting structure be two inches maximum over
the required knee clearance. Clear floor space at the accessible work surface allowing for a forward approach is required.
This provision limits the amount of clear floor space that may be provided under the work surface to 19 inches, and specifies
that knee space must be 30 inches wide and 19 inches deep.

 The NPRM proposed to require a work surface 30 inches long. As noted in ADAAG 13.3.4(1), a number of commenters pointed
out the inconsistency of requiring a T-shaped maneuvering clearance in a kitchen when the clearance under the work
surface is less than 36 inches. Further, an architect pointed out that ADAAG 7.2(1) requires a 36 inch wide counter
for ``incidental use'' and only 30 inches for spaces that affect a ``person's ability to be self-sufficient.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Paralyzed Veterans of America conducted informal research which may suggest that a T-turn is possible if corridors
are wider than 36 inches to compensate for doorways which are slightly narrower than 32 inches clear. However, further
study is necessary before changes are made in this area. Although the work surface is not required to be part of a T-shaped
turn, it seems probable that it will serve that purpose. Because a T-shaped turn is required by ADAAG 13.3.2(2) in accessible
spaces, the required kitchen work surface should be a minimum 36 inches in width. In addition, no other usable surface
required in ADAAG, including those for incidental use, is only 30 inches in width. It is likely that food preparation
will require some room for elbows in order to have adequate room to perform standard kitchen operations. A change has
been made to require a 36 inch work surface.

 A few commenters suggested that the sink should be required to be adjustable and not fixed. They reasoned that individuals

 The original proposal has been changed to specify that the sink, if adjustable, must be adjustable at two inch increments
from 28 to 36 inches. The Board recognizes that sinks that are adjustable are preferred over those that are fixed by
many people with disabilities. However, very little information was received regarding this option. The Board is
reluctant to depart from UFAS 4.34.6.5(1) in the absence of more detailed information, including costs and availability.

 The Greater Burlington Disability Council of Winooski, Vermont noted that the accident history of two Vermont public
housing authorities suggested that both floor ovens and wall ovens have serious drawbacks with respect to accessibility.
They, and other commenters, characterized both as unsafe. One commenter suggested that wall ovens with knee space
under them are particularly hazardous because of risks of being burned by hot items falling in the lap. A commenter
suggested that a combination convection/microwave oven was safer and more accessible.

 Ovens are difficult for many people to use. However, no safety data has been provided on which to base a requirement
for an alternative appliance. Knee space under wall ovens does not enhance their accessibility and invites accidents
and therefore, the guidelines provide that wall-ovens shall not have knee space under them.

 There appear to be no reasonable alternatives. Manufacturers offer very limited options for ovens with side controls
and the guidelines cannot limit design alternatives so severely at this time. The Board acknowledges that the relationship
between reach range and line of sight is a pertinent area of study that may bear on many other ADAAG provisions. For example,
the ANSI A117.1 Task Force on Automated Teller Machines is currently studying this issue.

 Because very few comments were received regarding this provision, and because only two commenters expressed a preference

of unit. Proposed ADAAG 13.3.4(8)(b)(ii) which required 100 percent of the refrigerator to be no higher than 54 inches
has been deleted to allow greater flexibility. Consequently, refrigerators, especially those with bottom mounted
freezers, may have some portion of the refrigerator outside of the reach ranges specified in ADAAG 4.2.5 and 4.2.6.
However, a new provision has been added to clarify that controls for refrigerator and freezer compartments must be

 The NPRM noted that the Board was considering requiring that a portion of the kitchen storage cabinets be provided
with pull-out shelving and requested comment on this subject. Responses varied widely. Most individuals with disabilities
and organizations representing them favored a requirement; a few offered alternatives such as shallow pantries
and lazy susan devices. On the other hand, State and local government housing providers felt that costs were too high
and several commenters noted that maintenance, not installation costs, were of great concern. Some commenters felt
features such as pull-out shelving or lazy susans should be the responsibility of the tenant. The American Society
of Interior Designers noted that supplying all base cabinets with pull-out shelving could add as much as one thousand
dollars to the cost of a kitchen. However, they added that floor space could be used more efficiently and perhaps fewer
shelves would have to be accessible. One commenter suggested that pull-out shelving in wall cabinets could cause
injuries from falling objects.

This section provides that dwelling units required to be accessible by ADAAG 13.2(1) and 13.2(2) comply with ADAAG
13.4. Dwelling units that are required to be fully accessible, as well as those required to be accessible to persons

which requires that emergency warning systems include both audible alarms complying with ADAAG 4.28.2 and visible
alarms complying with ADAAG 4.28.3. An equivalent facilitation provision permits the installation of appropriate
electrical outlets or connections so that visible alarms can be provided by the operator of the facility when they
are needed by a tenant. An appendix note has been added which provides some alternative methods of alerting residents
of emergencies. Such alternative methods may be required by the Department of Justice title II regulation implementing
title II of the ADA and by HUD's regulation implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This section
also requires permanently installed visible notification devices serving all living, sleeping, dining, kitchen
and bathrooms. Notification devices must include visible signals to alert occupants of incoming telephone calls
or door knocks or bells. Such devices must have controls for deactivation in sleeping rooms and may not be connected
to visible alarms. An equivalent facilitation provision permits telephone and other wiring to be installed at the
time of construction to accommodate portable notification devices which are provided by the operator of the facility
when needed by a tenant with a hearing impairment. Further, this section requires that permanently installed telephones

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the NPRM, visible alarms were required to comply with ADAAG 4.28.4 (Auxiliary Alarms) regardless of the type of
emergency warning system provided. The National Center for Law and Deafness recommended referencing ADAAG 4.28.3
(Visible Alarms) because either single station alarms, including smoke detectors, or building-wide alarms may
be provided in a residential dwelling unit. A few commenters were concerned that single station alarms or smoke detectors
would be required to be connected to a facility's central alarm. They stated that there would be a conflict in the technical
provisions if no such central alarm system existed and further were concerned that single station alarms would be
provided to persons with hearing impairments when a building wide alarm was provided to other residents of the facility.
In the NPRM, equivalent facilitation provisions were combined at proposed ADAAG 13.4(2) for all elements required
in dwelling units accessible to persons with hearing impairments. Commenters urged that provisions for equivalent
facilitation be clarified so that single station visible alarms are provided when single station audible alarms
are provided. Further, commenters suggested that the requirement was not clear as to what must be provided at the time
of construction and what may be provided as equivalent facilitation. Finally, commenters questioned why permanently
installed telephones were not required to be hearing aid compatible or to be equipped with a TTY but are required to
have a volume control.

 The provisions for visible alarms have been revised to reference ADAAG 13.3.2(10). For a more detailed discussion

requirements. Visible alarm and notification devices may be supplied by the operator of the facility during the tenancy
of a person with a hearing impairment provided that appropriate outlets, connections and wiring are installed at
the time of construction. A clarification has been added so that electrical outlets for single station visible alarms
must be provided when single station audible alarms are provided; and connections to the facility's central alarm
system must be provided to accommodate visible alarm appliances where a central alarm system is provided. Language
has been added to clarify that an electrical outlet would not be sufficient to accommodate a visible alarm appliance
that is part of a building wide alarm system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions have been added to the requirement for notification devices so that all primary areas of the dwelling unit
are adequately served. This does not require a device in each area provided that the signal is visible in the area. Additionally,
for the convenience of the occupant a provision has been added requiring controls for deactivating notification
devices in sleeping rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

With regard to telephones, this provision has been modified to reference ADAAG 4.31.5(1) and 4.31.5(2) which require

 The NPRM asked what provisions, if any, are necessary for residential housing to accommodate persons who are blind,
as well as those with low vision. The NPRM requested supporting data or other information, including building codes,
State or local requirements, and cost information. Individuals and organizations representing persons with disabilities
were asked to provide recommendations based on their experience or expertise. Commenters proposed requirements
that included: color schemes for baseboards, doors, and windows that contrast with the color of walls and floors;
standardizing placement rather than color contrasting; controls to be located on the front, top or side of stoves;
lighting fixtures which can accommodate 150 watt bulbs, with highly adjustable dimmers for tenants with residual
vision; elevators that have Braille and large print, as well as a voice synthesizer to announce floors; tactile signage
for car controls and hoistways in white characters on black background; edged stairs and handrails on both sides;
signage in areas such as laundry facilities, garbage areas, restrooms, and lounges; a 10 inch allowable height for
unlimited protruding objects rather than the 27 inch currently allowed; and air and heat thermostats, security and
fire alarms, and visitor indicators and identifiers equipped with talking systems.

Several State and local chapters of the National Federation of the Blind, other organizations, and many individuals
took the position that no adaptations are necessary for dwellings inhabited by persons who are blind. These individuals
and organizations maintain that issues such as color contrast and controls with tactile markings are largely a matter
of individual preference and need, and that guidelines in these areas could very easily interfere with some individuals'
needs and accustomed ways of functioning. These groups and individuals feel that establishing guidelines for dwelling
units would only serve to separate blind persons from the rest of society.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For each type of residential housing requirement suggested by commenters, varied and numerous means by which to achieve
the requirement were proposed. For example, commenters suggested various methods of providing color contrast.
Individual preferences and accommodations vary widely and it would therefore be difficult to accommodate all people
with vision impairments using one color. Similarly, on the issue of controls with tactile markings, commenters indicated
a variety of individual preferences for controls with tactile markings. Based on commenters' responses, no single
tactile marking can reasonably accommodate all individuals with vision impairments. The same rationale is applied
to types of lighting fixtures where commenters' responses varied widely and no one type of fixture is viewed as accommodating
a significant number of persons with vision impairments. A type of lighting that may be helpful for some persons, may
be harmful to others. Individuals with vision impairments may have had different training or have different needs,
so that any one requirement may exclude as many people as it may serve. For these reasons, the guidelines do not include
provisions for this section. Requirements for elevators, stairs, signage and protruding objects are already addressed
in ADAAG 4.1.3 and are applicable to residential housing.

14. Public Rights-of-Way
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADAAG 14 adapts provisions for buildings and facilities to new construction and alterations of pedestrian and related
facilities in the public right-of-way. This section covers work that involves elements of pedestrian access, circulation,
or use and that is undertaken in the public right-of-way whether by intention or as a consequence of other work. A right-of-way
is a legal right of passage and is distinguished from a site by its linear nature and connective function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions of this section apply to public sidewalks, including those on overpasses and bridges and in underpasses
and tunnels, and fixed street furnishings, such as benches, drinking fountains, telephones, toilet facilities,
bus shelters, and signage, that are located on or along public sidewalks and to public sidewalk curb ramps and street
crossings that complete the pedestrian circulation network. ADAAG 14 also contains provisions for on-street parking
spaces, parking meters and crossing controls, passenger loading zones on public streets, and callboxes along roadways.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modifications and specific requirements respond to the unique nature and function of public rights-of-way. For
example, natural terrain, constrained width, the number and complexity of services that must be accommodated within
and along the public right-of-way, and the demands of adjacent development offer little opportunity for the establishment
of accessible routes along public sidewalks. Thus, ADAAG 14 substitutes the concept of a continuous passage to connect
public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps, and street crossings into a pedestrian network that serves both adjacent
sites and elements intended for pedestrian use on and along the public sidewalk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM addressed the overall framework for a pedestrian circulation network, as well as the elements and components
of such a network. Almost 300 commenters responded to the proposed requirements and questions with several thousand
recommendations regarding public rights-of-way. One third of these commenters represented State and local governments.
Over half of the State and local government comments were submitted by transportation, streets and highways, and
public works agencies. Other commenters included: State code administrators, the National Conference of States
on Building Codes and Standards, 10 Federal agencies, 70 individuals with disabilities, State and local organizations
representing people with disabilities, and national organizations such as the Disability Rights Education and
Defense Fund (DREDF). Detailed comments were also received from the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) and the Eastern
Paralyzed Veterans Association (EPVA), as well as from national organizations representing individuals who are
blind or have vision impairments and organizations expressing the views of individuals who are deaf or have hearing
impairments. Additionally, comments were received from architects, civil and transportation engineers, national
trade and professional groups, and manufacturers of products and materials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM proposed a specific set of requirements that would apply to both new construction and alterations where feasible
and proposed a series of exceptions for a variety of conditions of site infeasibility. Commenters suggested that
such an approach might encourage departures from the guidelines with claims of site infeasibility that might not
be warranted and might make enforcement more difficult. Furthermore, opportunities to maximize the usability of
newly constructed pedestrian environments might be overlooked because of the availability of lesser options.

 The interim final rule has been reorganized and clarified to emphasize that public entities undertaking new work
must provide a high degree of accessibility in public rights-of-way. When making alterations to existing work that
involves pedestrian elements, entities must provide the maximum feasible degree of compliance with provisions
for new construction. This reorganization more clearly distinguishes between new construction and alterations
and provides a strong uniform set of accessibility requirements with few exceptions for new construction. For example,
the design of a new subdivision, new town, or an expansion of jurisdictional limits to incorporate as yet undeveloped
land must be fully accessible according to provisions of this section for new construction. A consistent approach
to public sidewalk, public sidewalk curb ramp, and intersection design is described for implementation when such
new work is undertaken.

Alterations provisions have been similarly reorganized to contain the exceptions proposed throughout the NPRM.
The interim final rule includes special technical provisions for alterations to address existing conditions and
constraints. Guided by the new construction requirements, which must be observed when feasible, entities making
alterations will be able to craft an alternative which best fits existing conditions. The distinction between new
construction and alterations is more fully discussed at ADAAG 14.2 (New Construction) and 14.3 (Alterations) and
in appendix notes to these sections.

This section is a scoping provision which applies the requirements of this section and those of ADAAG 4 (Accessible
Elements and Spaces: Scope and Technical Requirements) to pedestrian areas, elements, and facilities in the public
right-of-way which are subject to title II of the ADA. Where the provisions of this section differ from the requirements
of ADAAG 4, the provisions of this special application section prevail. An appendix note distinguishes between the
public right-of-way and adjacent sites, provides examples of work covered by this section, and clarifies the application

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to cover only work provided as part of a ``public improvement project.'' Several commenters from
the public works agencies of local governments noted that work in the public right-of-way may be accomplished in other
ways, as, for example, in urban areas, where public site improvements may be provided by developers of sites adjacent
to the public right-of-way. These and other commenters also requested a clarification of the responsibilities of
private sector entities (such as utilities) undertaking work in the public right-of-way by franchise or other agreement.

The term ``public improvement project'' is not used in the interim final rule. This clarifies that all work in the public
right-of-way is covered by this section. For example, these guidelines must be applied to work undertaken in the public
right-of-way by any entity under contract, agreement, or other arrangement, such as utilities, contractors, or
developers. However, because new or altered work in the public right-of-way will be constructed or installed within
the physical limits of a project area or the contractual limits of a project scope of work, all elements, areas and facilities
in the public right-of-way that are required to be accessible by section 14 retain the concept of the project as the
basis for their scoping. For example, the number of new on-street parking spaces required to be accessible by ADAAG
14.2.6(1)(a) will be based upon the total number of new on-street parking provided in the project area. The appendix
note has been expanded to include examples of covered projects.

Many commenters requested clarification of the differences between pedestrian facilities on a site covered by ADAAG
4 (e.g., a park, campus, plaza) and those in the public right-of-way covered by this section (e.g., public sidewalks).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only work in the public right-of-way is covered by ADAAG 14. The public right-of-way is the strip of land over which
a public road and its appurtenances (e.g., shoulders, parkways, and public sidewalks) are built. Most public rights-of-way
are coincident with and include roadways; some are established as easements to provide pedestrian access to a public
facility through private sites or properties. Public rights-of-way are generally limited in width, occupied below-grade
by public services, such as utilities, and above-grade by traffic control devices, signage, and other street furnishings.
A public or private site, however, is a parcel of land bounded by a property line or a designated portion of a public right-of-way.
For example, a new park or campus containing sidewalks, curb ramps, and street crossings, is a site covered by ADAAG
4.1.2 (Accessible Sites and Exterior Facilities: New Construction), whereas a downtown pedestrian shopping street
in the public right-of-way between opposing property lines is covered by ADAAG 14. The appendix note at A14.1 has been
expanded to clarify the distinction between a public right-of-way and a site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the future, the Department of Justice will consider whether to amend its regulation implementing title III to apply
ADAAG 14 to streets and sidewalks within large, privately-developed sites and subdivisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters requested clarification of the differences between ADAAG 14 and the technical provisions of ADAAG 4.2
through 4.35 for the same or similar elements, such as public sidewalk curb ramps, passenger loading zones, parking
spaces, and walks and sidewalks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the technical provisions in ADAAG 4.2 to 4.35 apply to public rights-of-way unless modified by ADAAG 14.
ADAAG 14 modifies some technical provisions of ADAAG 4.2 to 4.35 to address site constraints particular to the public
right-of-way. For example, a public sidewalk curb ramp in the public right-of-way is subject to the technical provisions
of ADAAG 14.2.4 (Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps), not to ADAAG 4.7 (Curb Ramps). A public sidewalk in the public right-of-way
is subject to the technical provisions of ADAAG 14.2.1 (Public Sidewalks), which substitutes a continuous passage
for the accessible route contained in ADAAG 4.3. Some technical provisions, however, such as those contained in 4.2.4
(Clear Floor or Ground Space for Wheelchairs), 4.9 (Stairs), and 4.27 (Controls and Operating Mechanisms) apply
without modification to public rights-of-way and are referenced in the interim final guidelines. This has been clarified
in an appendix note.

The NPRM defined a sidewalk as ``[a] walk in the public right-of-way along a vehicular way that is part of a pedestrian
circulation network.'' The City of Portland (OR) urged that the definition include walks in public rights-of-way
or easements that may not be contiguous with vehicular ways, noting that they are subject to similar constraints of
terrain, width, and adjacent development. Commenters from design and engineering disciplines stated that both
paving and separation were integral to the concept of a sidewalk in transportation and public works specifications.
One commenter encouraged use of a definition of sidewalk commonly recognized by streets and highway authorities.

Good engineering practice provides that public sidewalks be both paved and separated, either horizontally or vertically,
from adjoining roadways. While this may be a more accurate technical definition of public sidewalk, these guidelines
are intended also to cover pedestrian walkways that are not raised and separated, as for example, roadway shoulders
in rural areas improved for pedestrian use. The definition of public sidewalk has therefore been modified to broaden
its application to include such pedestrian routes. Walkways in public pedestrian easements have also been added.
The word ``public'' has been added to clarify the distinction between sidewalks in the public right-of-way and those
within sites. The appendix note has been expanded to provide other examples of public sidewalks.

Proposed ADAAG 14.5 (Curb Ramps and Other Sloped Areas) required curb ramps or other sloped areas where pedestrian
walkways cross barriers at streets. ``Other sloped areas'' is found in the Department of Justice regulations implementing
title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150(d)(2)) and applies to elevation changes within public sidewalks at street crossings
that are not accomplished by means of a curb ramp. Several commenters requested clarification of the term ``other

ADAAG 14.5 has been moved to ADAAG 14.2.4 (Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps) and a new definition for ``Public Sidewalk Curb
Ramps'' has been added to ADAAG 14.1.1. The definition describes perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps, including
diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps, and parallel public sidewalk curb ramps and clarifies that these are alternative
means of achieving the transition between curb height and street crossing. Although ADAAG currently contains a definition
and technical provisions for curb ramps on sites, public sidewalk curb ramps must meet different requirements. For
example, public sidewalk curb ramps in a public right-of-way are required to have level landings. Language was added
to the definition of Curb Ramp in 3.5 (Definitions) referencing Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps. The phrase ``parallel
public sidewalk curb ramp'' has been substituted for ``other sloped areas.''

Vehicular way is defined in ADAAG 3.5 (Definitions). Under the Uniform Vehicle Code, bicyclists are considered motorists.
When using a public sidewalk, however, a bicyclist has the same rights and duties as a pedestrian (Uniform Vehicle
Code and Model Traffic Ordinance, Article XII, National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, Revised
1992). If pedestrian use is intended, a bicycle path in the public right-of-way must comply with the requirements
for public sidewalks.

The NPRM proposed a definition of site infeasibility adapted from the definition of technical infeasibility in ADAAG
4.1.6(1)(j). Most commenters supported both the necessity for and the definition of site infeasibility in the NPRM.
One commenter asked for a clarification of the difference between extremes of terrain discussed in the NPRM and structural
impracticability due to unique characteristics of terrain, described in the preamble to the Department of Justice
final regulation implementing title III of the ADA. (56 FR 35577). A FHWA region recommended that constraints arising
from common practice in the geometric design of certain street and highway structures, such as bridges and tunnels,
be specifically included as examples of site infeasibility.

Site infeasibility is intended to be the basis for exceptions to new construction guidelines for additions and alterations
in the public right-of-way. This definition has been clarified by substituting the phrase ``site development conditions''
for ``physical or site constraints'' in the NPRM. Extremes of terrain are recognized in both new construction and
alterations provisions by permitting public sidewalks to take the running slope of adjacent roadways without invoking
an exception. Thus, steeply sloping terrain is not in itself grounds for a finding of site infeasibility. Rather,
it is adjacent development and constrained right-of-way width that give rise to exceptions for site infeasibility.
Where newly-constructed bridges and tunnels are intended to carry pedestrian traffic, they must incorporate public
sidewalks that meet section 14 provisions. This is further discussed at ADAAG 14.2.5(4).

State and local departments of public works, members of the site planning and engineering professions, and individuals
with disabilities and the organizations that represent them recommended that the final rule distinguish between
new construction and alterations. Most jurisdictions were concerned that the proposed guidelines were too restrictive
for alterations. Commenters noted that provisions limiting cross slope, requiring level landings at public sidewalk
curb ramps, or specifying counter slope at street crossings could be achieved in new construction but not in every
alteration. Persons with disabilities and organizations representing them commented that the number of exceptions
provided in the NPRM to accommodate existing conditions could also be used to excuse compliance in new construction.
For example, one commenter noted that although all accessibility standards require that new public sidewalk curb
ramps be constructed to the least possible slope, most exceed the 1:12 maximum permitted slope. On the other hand,
as noted by one engineer, guidelines that are overly stringent may discourage implementation.

 Several municipalities and members of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) suggested that a set of fixed requirements
could not be applied or enforced under the variety of site constraints commonly encountered along public rights-of-way.
Instead, they advocated a performance standard that would allow more flexibility in responding to local conditions.
Some jurisdictions, however, requested detailed guidance. The City of St. Louis commented that, ``In order to assure
access for persons with disabilities, clear and comprehensive regulations are needed.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A performance specification or standard generally describes a desired goal for new construction but does not prescribe
a methodology. For example, ADAAG 4.34.5 (Equipment for Persons with Vision Impairments) requires that automated
teller machine instructions and information be made accessible to persons with vision impairments, but it does not
require a specific solution. A performance standard might be useful in ADAAG 14, where most work will probably be constructed
or installed within an already well-developed public right-of-way subject to a variety of differing needs, conditions,
and constraints that cannot be fully anticipated. A detailed specification will be useful to public works agencies
evaluating alternatives, particularly where site constraints may appear to limit options. Additionally, it might
be more difficult to determine compliance with a performance specification in such a complex application. Accordingly,

A blanket exception might have the effect of permitting the least accessible alternative even in new construction
when greater accessibility might be achieved. Although the interim final rule includes some limited exceptions
for certain conditions in new construction, there is no exception for site infeasibility. However, alterations
provisions include both general and specific exceptions for conditions of site infeasibility when strict compliance
with new construction provisions cannot be achieved.

A few commenters misconstrued the preamble discussion in the NPRM to require the construction of public sidewalks
or continuous pedestrian routes where none may now exist. Several jurisdictions submitted estimates of costs to
retrofit existing pedestrian elements to meet the proposed guidelines. Others voiced concerns about their obligations
under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). Several commenters asked how the issuance of new
guidelines would affect their transition plans required by the Department of Justice regulations implementing
title II of the ADA. ITE suggested that work done under a prior standard be exempted from application of the final guidelines.

ADAAG 14 covers newly-undertaken construction, the addition of pedestrian elements, and the alteration of the existing
pedestrian environment. It does not require entities covered by title II of the ADA to retrofit existing elements.
If new construction, additions, or alterations are undertaken, they must be constructed to be accessible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150) and section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) may impose additional requirements. Path of travel obligations arising
out of alterations to a public sidewalk, public sidewalk curb ramp, or street crossing may require the construction
of accessible connections between these and other pedestrian elements. This is discussed more fully at ADAAG 14.3.

Many commenters' concerns resulted from a misunderstanding that the NPRM required a retrofit of existing construction.
The requirements of this section are consistent with standard engineering practice in new construction, as detailed
in the Standard Plans and Specifications for Public Works Construction, section 1 (American Public Works Association
(APWA) and Associated General Contractors (AGC). These provisions apply to alterations of existing public sidewalks
only to the extent feasible and therefore excessive cost is not anticipated. A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) has
been prepared which examines the monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits to building owners, operators, and
users of the guidelines. The RIA is available to the public.

The NPRM proposed that public sidewalks contain a continuous passage that connects to accessible routes on adjacent
sites and to pedestrian elements on the sidewalk. Many commenters interpreted the proposed rule to require a continuous
passage connecting pedestrian elements even when a public sidewalk did not exist. Several asked whether the provision
required the interconnection of existing public sidewalk segments within a jurisdiction. A number of persons with
disabilities and groups representing persons with disabilities suggested that public sidewalks should be required
in all developed zones of a jurisdiction, particularly in residential areas.

are accessible. The Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA cover the maintenance of accessible
features (See 28 CFR 35.133). ADAAG 14 does not require the marking of a continuous passage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that public sidewalks, or a continuous passage within them, connect to accessible routes on adjacent
properties. A number of commenters were concerned with the technical difficulties of such connections along steeply
sloping public sidewalks. This is especially problematic along undeveloped sites where the location of the accessible
route or entrance has not yet been established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where entrance elevations can be fixed before public sidewalk construction, a level platform can be provided by careful
engineering design. Where connections cannot be anticipated, a level walkway diverging from the public sidewalk
running slope can serve a number of potential entrances. An appendix note further describes this approach. Recessed
entrances and building setbacks will provide the necessary distance to achieve a smooth blending of the connection
from the public sidewalk to the building entrance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where walks containing an accessible route on an adjacent site must connect to sloping public sidewalks, some warping
and blending may be necessary. This must be accommodated on the site if the public sidewalk has already been constructed.
However, when the developer of a property is also responsible for new public sidewalk design and construction, as
is often the case in urban construction, the coordination of such connections can be accomplished through careful
site engineering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These public/private interfaces are somewhat analogous to the landlord/tenant responsibilities for accessibility
under title III of the ADA; each must comply where he has the authority to operate. The appendix discussion has been
expanded to clarify these issues. In many cases, a developer will provide both public sidewalks and private walks
as part of the same project. Jurisdictions may require, through the permitting process, that adjacent property owners
blend accessible routes at the continuous passage when sites are developed.

Paragraph (1) requires that the continuous passage within a new public sidewalk be a minimum of 36 inches in width or
as shown in Figures 7(a) and (b) when a turn must be made around an obstruction. It further requires that passing spaces
be provided at intervals that do not exceed 200 feet when public sidewalk width is less than 60 inches continuously.

The NPRM proposed that a public sidewalk, or a continuous passage within its width, be a minimum of 36 inches in width.
Most commenters recommended that public sidewalks be a minimum of 48 inches wide (and even wider in commercial areas).
One county public works agency submitted a copy of standard public works details and specifications that illustrated
a minimum sidewalk width of 48 inches throughout. Other jurisdictions indicated similar or greater width requirements
for new construction. Most commenters also supported the proposed requirement for passing spaces, although several
questioned the need for them in suburban and rural areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule requires a 36 inch minimum continuous passage to ensure an unobstructed route, clear of street
furnishings, equipment, and other items commonly associated with public sidewalks, along the pedestrian walkway.
Although common street and public sidewalk engineering practice support a 48 inch minimum width, these guidelines
represent minimum requirements. A requirement that the width of the continuous passage be as shown in Figures 7(a)
and (b) has been added for consistency with ADAAG 4.3.3 (Width). A 60 inch wide public sidewalk incorporating passing
space will generally be provided in commercial areas. Greater widths are recommended in current FHWA guidelines
and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards for new construction
in such areas (AASHTO, ``A Policy on the Geometric Design of Highways and Streets'', 1990). Residential neighborhoods,
where pedestrian volume may be light, and other low-pedestrian-volume zones such as rural and suburban areas, office
parks and similar developments, will commonly be served by 48 inch wide walkways, along which passing spaces must
be provided. Passing space may be available at intersecting walks, at building entrances, at driveways, or even at
bus stops and street crossings. Additional public sidewalk width is commonly provided at regular intervals to provide
a structural surface for storm drainage inlets, utility vaults, and similar below-grade construction. This common
practice can provide the required passing space, as well. Because these guidelines apply to areas where pedestrian
volumes may change radically over time, public sidewalks must be designed to accommodate potential as well as actual
levels of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Narrow public sidewalks and rights-of-way without parkways will generally require parallel public sidewalk curb
ramps rather than perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps at street crossings because of the lack of width for the
landing required at the top of a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp. Although the requirements for width have
been reorganized, no substantive changes have been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In new construction, where public sidewalks must have a consistent cross slope across their full width, the 36 inch
continuous passage (or the additional maneuvering space described in Figures 7(a) and (b)) serve only to ensure that
passage is not blocked by fixed or movable items. In alterations, the continuous passage may be the only portion of
a wider public sidewalk in which cross slope can be maintained within usable limits, as further discussed in ADAAG
14.3 (Alterations). The continuous passage will also be a factor where public sidewalks cross driveways, as only
36 inches must be provided at the 1:50 cross slope. A driveway apron cannot be part of the continuous passage if its slope
to the street exceeds 1:50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, where gratings are installed in public sidewalks, a continuous passage must be provided to bypass them.
Where large areas of gratings may be required to ventilate subsurface transformer vaults or similar construction,
designers should provide the necessary surface area by increasing the length of a run of gratings so as to minimize
its width relative to the public sidewalk width.

. Individuals with disabilities and commenters from organizations representing them strongly supported maintaining
cross slope limitations at 1:50, emphasizing the difficulty of negotiating surfaces with cross and counter slopes.
Travel along surfaces with a severe cross slope is difficult for persons using wheelchairs and mobility aids even
when the running slope is imperceptible. However, many municipalities requested that exceptions be permitted,
citing the infeasibility of achieving a maximum cross slope of 1:50 in alterations to existing construction in the
public right-of-way.

. Limited exceptions from the requirement for a maximum cross slope of 1:50 have been included in the alterations section.
The 1:50 maximum has been well-established in accessibility standards since 1961 and is also well-established in
civil engineering standards as the minimum necessary for positive drainage for exterior improved surfaces. New
development and adjacent public sidewalks should be planned with this limitation clearly in mind. Providing landings
with a minimum cross slope at intersecting public sidewalks is standard design practice in new construction and will
simplify the later placement of crossing controls and similar pedestrian elements that require a level area for a
wheelchair approach. No substantive changes have been made in this requirement.

. The NPRM asked whether level landings should be required along steeply sloping public sidewalks, citing a requirement
in the California Accessibility Standards (title 24 part 2 section 712 (1989)) requiring landings at 400-foot intervals.
Many persons with disabilities, organizations representing persons with disabilities, and even a few municipalities
supported such a concept. Several noted that this could be accomplished without appreciably increasing the running
slope of a public sidewalk. Others recommended level areas adjacent to and along public sidewalks of extreme grade.
Such areas would allow persons with mobility impairments or low stamina to pause while ascending or descending. Most
municipalities, however, responded negatively, citing excessive cost, custom construction, and limited utility.
Several commenters recommended handrails as being more useful along steep slopes. Some commenters suggested that
providing landings along steeply sloping sites would be less useful to persons using wheelchairs than would the development
of alternative routes or operational solutions.

. A requirement for a mid-block level landing where walkway slope is extreme would not be onerous in new construction.
However, few commenters recommended specific public sidewalk slope limitations and interval criteria that would
help establish provisions. Most new intersections will provide level landings at approximately 200-foot intervals.
No provision for intermediate level landings along a public sidewalk has been included in the interim final rule.
Operational considerations, such as the development of alternative routes, are not covered by these guidelines.

 The NPRM proposed that public sidewalk surfaces be stable, firm and slip-resistant. Several commenters were concerned
about the requirement for slip resistance on public sidewalks, noting that moisture, ice, and snow frequently compromise
pedestrian traction on public rights-of-way, particularly on sloping public sidewalks and public sidewalk curb

public sidewalks were not always slip-resistant because of environmental conditions, particularly snow and ice.

it might not be consistent and noted that differences could be hazardous to pedestrians. The California Accessibility

 The interim final rule has been changed to include a requirement that new public sidewalks should be consistently
graded. This is standard practice in new construction. In alterations, the warping of a continuous passage may be
necessary to provide a usable route to elements along an existing public sidewalk. Where a public sidewalk in the right-of-way
is contiguous with a paved walk on a site, as is common in urban areas where their design and construction may be undertaken
as part of a single project, ADAAG 14 will apply to the public sidewalk only. Transitions must be smoothly blended.

 The NPRM proposed that gratings with elongated openings be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the
dominant direction of travel. Several individuals pointed out that gratings in public sidewalks may be located where
pedestrians will cross them in two perpendicular directions, noting that those who use wheelchairs can become stuck
in the long openings in such situations. Commenters reported on the difficulty of turning a wheelchair on grating
surfaces. Several others found gratings hazardous for persons using walkers, crutches, and canes, even when the
gratings comply with ADAAG 4.5.4 (Gratings). An architect noted that urban public sidewalks frequently have large
expanses of gratings over public sidewalk vaults where transformers, utilities, and subway construction occur
below grade. One Department of Transportation regional engineer inquired whether public sidewalk freight elevator
covers and similar appurtenances should be prohibited from the continuous passage.

 This provision has been revised to prohibit gratings in the continuous passage in new construction. An appendix note
clarifies that grating proportions or location can be varied to ensure that gratings do not encroach on the required
continuous passage. Openings in gratings can be no greater than 1/2 inch wide when measured perpendicular to the direction
of travel. Where public sidewalks intersect and travel is in two directions, openings may not exceed 1/2 inch in either
direction. Gratings have also been prohibited in landings and public sidewalk curb ramps and in adjacent surfaces
at street crossings (see ADAAG 14.2.4(8)). Elevator covers and similar items located in a continuous passage must
comply with surface requirements.

 A provision derived from ADAAG 10 (Transportation Facilities) has been added, limiting the horizontal gap in new
public sidewalk construction to the minimum necessary for passage of wheel flanges, not to exceed 21/2 inches. Horizontal
surfaces must be flush. Although the NPRM did not expressly include this provision, it is taken from ADAAG 10.3.1(13)

Several commenters noted that the NPRM did not include a provision requiring edge protection where the back-of-sidewalk
edge may be raised above adjacent grade, forming a drop-off.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Edge protection should be provided in such circumstances. A note recommending such practice has been added to the
appendix. Codes and standards affecting the design and construction of public sidewalks will generally require
a barrier at substantial drop-offs, such as when a public sidewalk crosses a bridge or culvert. For example, the California
Accessibility Regulations (title 24 part 2 (1993)) require back-of-sidewalk protection where there is a differential
of more than four inches in level.

Paragraph (4) requires that new public sidewalks be raised to curb height or separated horizontally by a parkway or
similar setback from an adjacent roadway. An exception permits unseparated public sidewalks along undeveloped

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that all public sidewalks be separated horizontally or vertically from the adjacent roadway with
continuous curbing, planted parkways, or other barriers to distinguish streets from public sidewalks. Many suburban
and rural jurisdictions were concerned that public sidewalk provisions might be construed to require separation
in roadway shoulders, bikeways, and similar surfaces sometimes used by pedestrians. Several commenters asked for
clarification of the meaning of ``other barrier'' and noted that some types of barriers (e.g., guardrails) would
make these routes more dangerous for bicyclists and would preclude vehicular use of the shoulder, a common practice
in rural communities where oversize equipment or slow moving farm vehicles commonly travel in this area. A few commenters
noted that non-pedestrian uses predominated along routes of this type. However, a traffic engineer submitted photographs
of public sidewalks without separation at street grade along well-developed commercial strips in Florida and indicated
that public sidewalks were still commonly constructed in this way even where pedestrian use is substantial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section considers all walkways established for pedestrian use in the public right-of-way to be public sidewalks,
including those on roadway shoulders where pedestrian use is intended. Many rural areas, where destinations are
widely separated and pedestrian use is low, simply pave a public right-of-way to include an improved shoulder of six
to eight feet in width for the use of cyclists and pedestrians. There may be an intervening gutter that makes continuous
travel across intersections difficult for persons using wheelchairs or walking aids. Cross slope may be fairly severe
where the roadway and shoulder cross-section is designed to drain to a swale or ditch along the back of the public sidewalk.
Differentiation between vehicular and pedestrian areas is often no more than a painted line or drainage ditch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception to the requirement for separation has been added for rural areas where roadway frontages are not developed.
In other areas, public sidewalks must be separated. The use of unseparated routes is not safe for any pedestrian. Furthermore,
curbs and changes in surface material provide cues for pedestrians to distinguish between pedestrian and vehicular
areas. Good practice includes the construction of raised or horizontally separated public sidewalks in all commercial
areas and along other routes when pedestrian volume is more than incidental.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``other barriers'' includes material and texture changes, physical barriers, such as planters or guardrails,
or distinguishable edges, such as wheelstops or guidestrips.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM reserved a section on historic and special use sidewalks and sought comment on how the requirements for historic
preservation could be reconciled with provisions for new construction. Organizations representing historic preservation
interests generally favored covering public sidewalks in historic neighborhoods and districts in the same way as
ADAAG currently covers historic buildings and facilities, noting however that there is no designation for ``historic''
public sidewalks alone. Other commenters supported a provision for an alternative route, although little information
was submitted on how such a route might be provided. Many commenters requested clarification on whether walkways
in historic landscapes were covered by this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No commenters made specific recommendations on accessibility criteria appropriate to public sidewalks of historic
construction. Historic landscapes, parks, and gardens are covered under ADAAG 4 as sites. Existing requirements
that public sidewalk surfaces be stable, firm, and slip-resistant are achievable in alterations to public sidewalks
of historic interest. Therefore, this section has been removed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These provisions parallel those of ADAAG 4.4 (Protruding Objects) and are applied to public sidewalks and the areas
adjacent to them. An appendix note clarifies the application of these provisions to the full public sidewalk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM sought comment on the effectiveness of the 27 inch maximum height limitation for protruding objects on public
sidewalks and about the discernibility of wall-mounted and post-mounted objects. Most comments on these provisions
came from persons with vision impairments, organizations representing persons who are blind or have vision impairments,
and from mobility instructors responsible for training persons in wayfinding techniques. A majority felt that current
ADAAG requirements for buildings and facilities were not adequate for public sidewalk environments, where pedestrians
may be forced to adopt a restricted cane sweep technique in congested areas. Several commenters added that the speed
with which people walk outdoors may cause them to encounter protruding objects before the cane sweep can detect them.
Although there was considerable support for lowering the maximum height of 27 inches, there was no clear consensus.
Many commenters urged further study of this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of commenters were opposed to the provision permitting post-mounted objects to overhang their supports
by up to 12 inches. These commenters noted the common practice of installing telephones, signs, and similar objects
on poles, rather than projecting them from building faces, where the four inch limitation on wall-mounted elements
would apply. Most felt that the determination of what was a protruding object should not be affected by mounting conditions.
Many commenters recommended additional study of this issue as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, almost a third of commenters who identified themselves as persons who are blind or have vision impairments
or who represented local, State, and national organizations for persons with vision impairments opposed any change
in the requirements. They noted that there is no compelling evidence of a need to change current ADAAG provisions nor
any data on which to base a change for conditions along a public pedestrian right-of-way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters addressing the headroom provision recommended that landscaping elements be included in coverage. Several
noted that overhanging tree branches are a major hazard along public sidewalks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters from State and local government jurisdictions were largely concerned with policing and enforcement
issues and requested clarification of who would be responsible to ensure that clear headroom was provided along a
public sidewalk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision permitting a 12 inch overhang for post-mounted objects is well-established in accessibility regulations
and has always been applied to frontal approaches only, as shown in Figure 8(d), and not to parallel or side approaches.
Although ADAAG provisions for protruding objects may not adequately serve all segments of the pedestrian population,
no data were provided on which to base a change to the provision. The provision remains substantially unchanged, with
only editorial modifications. The appendix note has been expanded to reference the provision regarding the maintenance
of accessible features in the Department of Justice regulation implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.133).

This section contains scoping and technical provisions for items installed on or adjacent to a public sidewalk. It

Paragraph (1) requires that drinking fountains at a single location provide accessibility both to persons who use
wheelchairs and to persons who have difficulty stooping or bending. Paragraph (2) requires that all public pay telephones
newly installed on or along public sidewalks be hearing aid compatible and have volume controls. Where a single unit
is installed at a location, it must be accessible to a person using a wheelchair. Where a bank of telephones is provided,
one unit per bank must be accessible to persons using wheelchairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed that 50 percent of drinking fountains and public telephones provided in a public improvement project
be accessible. This would have required that half of all such items installed in a project be accessible and be dispersed
throughout a project area. As noted above, the term ``public improvement project'' has been deleted. When drinking
fountains, public telephones, and similar items are installed along a public sidewalk, they are typically dispersed
rather than clustered and are considered public and common use elements. Therefore, the scoping provision has been
changed to require accessibility at each location where a drinking fountain or public telephone is provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Drinking fountains in parks and playgrounds are located on public sites and are therefore covered by the scoping provisions
in ADAAG 4.1.3 (Accessible Buildings and Facilities: New Construction) and 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings and Facilities:
Alterations) and not by this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that 75 percent of public telephones have volume controls. One municipality and several organizations
representing persons with hearing impairments recommended that all public telephones installed along public sidewalks
have volume controls because of the high incidence of hearing loss in an aging population. Other commenters noted
that the cost of such an adaptation is low. Providing public telephones with volume controls is becoming common practice
in noisy environments such as public rights-of-way. Several other comments from organizations representing persons
who are deaf recommended that public telephone scoping be expanded to require exterior TTYs. A manufacturer of such
units submitted technical data and encouraged the Board to require TTYs on public sidewalks, noting that interior
installations in buildings and facilities are not generally available after business hours.

The interim final provision has been changed to require that all public telephones have volume controls and be hearing
aid compatible. The requirement for signage in ADAAG 4.30.7 (Symbols of Accessibility) applies only to telephones
required to be accessible by ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(b) (Accessible Buildings and Facilities: New Construction) and therefore
does not apply to this section. Hearing aid compatibility is already required of these telephones by the Hearing Aid
Compatibility Act of 1988. (See 47 CFR part 68). Advances in TTY technology that make exterior installations feasible
are being tested in several States. Requirements for exterior installations will be considered in future rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that 50 percent of single user toilet facilities installed on or along a public sidewalk as part of
a public improvement project comply with ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet Rooms) and sought comment on whether such scoping was
appropriate in light of concerns for public safety, cost, and limited access procedures. The proposed provision
would have required that half of all such items installed in a project be accessible and be dispersed throughout a project
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One manufacturer of single user toilet facilities proposed that only a percentage of units (e.g., one in four) in a
``cluster'' be accessible and that a definition of cluster be provided that would establish a maximum distance between
units in a cluster, such as at the same intersection, within several blocks, or ``within sight'' of each other. However,
almost all comments from persons with disabilities and organizations representing persons with disabilities supported
full accessibility to all toilet units placed on public sidewalks, citing the ADAAG requirement that all new public
and common use toilet rooms on sites and in buildings be accessible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters, including many municipalities and one manufacturer of public toilet units, supported a 50 percent
or lesser requirement. These commenters stated that the accessible units, which are larger than inaccessible units,
would be quickly vandalized and rendered unusable. Many commenters agreed that the larger accessible units could
be used for shelter or illicit activities, but felt that this was not a reason to limit accessibility. Other commenters
noted that both accessible and inaccessible units would be subject to vandalism and abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City of San Francisco required that firms responding to its recent Request for Proposals for public toilet facilities

Many commenters were opposed to special access requirements, such as cards and tokens, if they were required only
of persons with disabilities. Several suggested that the logistics of a card distribution program would be complex
and discriminatory. A number of commenters noted that providing separate adjacent facilities for persons with disabilities
and persons without disabilities was wasteful of resources and space and could not ensure maintenance of either unit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Single-user public toilet facilities are fixed common use elements. ADAAG 4.1.2 (6) requires all fixed public and
common use toilet facilities located on a site to be accessible. Therefore, the scoping provision in this section
has been changed to require the same degree of accessibility at each location in the public right-of-way where a single
user toilet facility is provided on a public sidewalk. The concept of clustering (e.g., units spaced a block or street
width apart) suggested by some commenters is not consistent with the current ADAAG concept, which assumes that accessible
and inaccessible units are immediately adjacent. As discussed above, the term ``public improvement project'' has
been deleted in the interim final rule.

The NPRM proposed that five percent of fixed seating, tables, and benches provided in a public improvement project
be accessible and be dispersed throughout a project area. Commenters supported a requirement for both backs and armrests
on at least some benches, although a few noted that armrests could interfere with transfer from wheelchairs. Several
wheelchair users indicated that they would be unlikely to transfer from their wheelchairs to benches along a public
sidewalk, although they might do so in a park or plaza setting. Scoping percentages for benches with arms and backrests
between 20 and 50 percent were recommended. The NPRM also sought comment on ADAAG specifications for benches. Many
commenters noted that backs and armrests are needed so that ambulatory persons with mobility or stamina impairments
can use them. Although there was no consensus about back, seat, or armrest height, most commenters recommended that
the reference to ADAAG 4.35.4 (Dressing and Fitting Rooms: Bench) be removed because it is not applicable to benches
of the type generally placed along public rights-of-way. A few commenters recommended that a space be required at
the end of a bench for the positioning of a wheelchair to allow shoulder-to-shoulder seating. One commenter recommended
that benches be located only within a strip reserved for street furnishings along a curb and clear of the pedestrian
circulation path.

The NPRM sought comment on whether certain types of pedestrian signage should be made accessible to persons who are
blind or have vision impairments and what technologies, such as audible signage, are available to provide orientation
information. Although many comments were received from individuals with vision impairments and organizations
representing them, no clear consensus emerged. Many commenters, including one national organization representing
persons who are blind, stated that properly trained individuals with vision impairments did not need and could not
use tactile signs in the public right-of-way because of the lack of standardized placement. These commenters also
stated that audible signage might mask other environmental cues and strongly opposed any change to current ADAAG
requirements. Other commenters, including three national organizations representing individuals with vision
impairments, supported both tactile and audible signage and submitted detailed recommendations and data on currently
available technologies. Several commenters noted that tactile bus route signage would be useful.

Many commenters, including all of those from organizations representing persons with disabilities, supported
the approach outlined in the NPRM that requires public sidewalk curb ramps to serve all street crossings, regardless
of the slope of the adjacent public sidewalk. As DREDF stated in its response, ``Even on steep sites, persons using
motorized chairs or receiving assistance can use ramps, and they should be available if there is a pedestrian walkway.''
Others were concerned about the safety of persons using steeply sloping public sidewalk curb ramps.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public sidewalks and public sidewalk curb ramps that meet the provisions of this section allow persons with disabilities
to make the choice of whether to use them or not. This is consistent with other applications of the ADA, which clearly
prohibit discrimination based upon assumptions about an individual's abilities. Therefore, even under extreme
site conditions, access must be provided.

Paragraph (2) requires that a new street crossing be served by a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp and provides
an exception allowing a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp or a combination of the two types where right-of-way width
cannot accommodate a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp. Diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps, including depressed
corners, and built-up (e.g., projected) public sidewalk curb ramps are permitted only in alterations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A variety of public sidewalk curb ramp details and standards for their application were submitted by commenters.
Detailed technical comments were received from the U.S. Department of Transportation and several of its regional
divisions and from the transportation departments of four States. Many of these comments recommended that exceptions
be provided for various conditions in existing developed rights-of-way. Commenters from public works agencies
noted that a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp and landing for a six-inch curb height would require at least
10 feet of public sidewalk width and recommended that other alternatives be permitted. However, most indicated that
public pedestrian rights-of-way already established in central business districts and commercial areas were sufficiently
wide to accommodate a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp and landing. Other jurisdictions indicated that they
provide similar or greater right-of-way width in intensively developed zones. One county submitted a copy of the
standard details and specifications for public sidewalk curb ramps developed jointly by APWA and AGC that showed
a minimum landing of 48 inches connecting to a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp as a basic standard. Perpendicular
public sidewalk curb ramps were greatly preferred by people with disabilities, including people with mobility impairments
and those with vision impairments. Parallel public sidewalk curb ramp construction was suggested as a secondary
option. However, parallel public sidewalk curb ramps were preferred to perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps
without landings or with 36 inch landings when right-of-way width is limited.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 10 to 15 foot right-of-way between curb face and property line is common in existing commercial districts. A 12 foot
minimum can be easily accommodated in new land use planning as a first step in standardizing public sidewalk and street
crossing details in areas of significant pedestrian activity. Public sidewalk curb ramps must be perpendicular
to the curb where right-of-way width permits their installation. Parallel public sidewalk curb ramps or combinations
of parallel and perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps are permitted where right-of-way width may be narrower,
as in residential neighborhoods and other low pedestrian volume zones. Other alternatives suggested by commenters,
such as diagonal and built-up public sidewalk curb ramps, will be permitted in alterations. No substantive change
has been made to this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A diverse group of commenters recommended that a separate public sidewalk curb ramp be required for each crossing
direction (e.g., crosswalk) rather than a single diagonal public sidewalk curb ramp serving two perpendicular crossings.
One city is discontinuing the installation of diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps in response to the concerns of pedestrians.
Several commenters with vision impairments submitted accounts of difficulty with diagonal public sidewalk curb
ramps and blended intersections. Other comments noted that diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps at intersections
require that a turn be made to use either crosswalk. This is time-consuming for many and makes it difficult to complete
a street crossing in the time allotted by crossing signals. Diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps may also require persons
using wheelchairs to travel in lanes of moving traffic as they leave the public sidewalk. Depressed corners, as proposed
in Figure 58(a) of the NPRM, were considered both hazardous and difficult to drain. Many commenters recommended that
each street crossing in a narrow right-of-way be served by a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp instead of a perpendicular
public sidewalk curb ramp without a landing. Negotiating two consecutive parallel public sidewalk curb ramps was
preferred over negotiating the cross slope of a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp that did not have a landing.

Public sidewalk curb ramps that are perpendicular to a street crossing provide direct access to the crosswalk and
do not require pedestrians to cross into perpendicular traffic lanes. The interim final rule prohibits diagonal
public sidewalk curb ramps and depressed corners in new construction. Diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps are, however,
permitted in alterations.

Paragraph (4) requires a 48 inch deep landing at the top of, and equal to the width of, a perpendicular public sidewalk

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments from persons with disabilities supported the requirement for a 48 inch landing at the top of public sidewalk
curb ramps. Many objected to perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps that do not have landings and which require
pedestrians to negotiate across a complex cross slope. Commenters cited three major concerns regarding the lack
of a level landing at the top of a public sidewalk curb ramp: (1) lack of a space to turn when approaching a public sidewalk
curb ramp; (2) lack of a space to bypass the public sidewalk curb ramp, and (3) lack of a level area to rest and turn after
ascending the public sidewalk curb ramp. The NPRM provided an exception that would permit a 36 inch deep landing under
conditions of site infeasibility. Comments from persons with disabilities did not support the exception, noting
that a 36 inch landing was too narrow to be useful.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision is consistent with ADAAG 4.2.1 (Size and Approach) specifications for clear floor or ground space
for wheelchairs, which requires a 30 inch wide by 48 inch long area for a single wheelchair. Unlike ADAAG 4.8.4 (Ramps),
which requires a landing 60 inches in length where ramps change direction, additional space available on and adjacent
to a public sidewalk will provide adequate clearance for footrests and longer motorized wheelchairs. While a 36 inch
landing would provide an adequate passage for a person using a wheelchair bypassing a public sidewalk curb ramp, it
will not accommodate a 90 degree turn with all wheels on level ground. Consistent with comments discussed at 14.2 (New
Construction: Minimum Requirements), the exception proposed in the NPRM to allow a 36 inch wide landing in cases of
site infeasibility has been limited to alterations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (5) requires that the minimum feasible running slope be used for a public sidewalk curb ramp and establishes
a 1:12 maximum slope when measured from a level plane. An exception permits parallel public sidewalk curb ramps constructed
along sloping public sidewalks to be steeper than a slope of 1:12 if a ramp at 1:12 would extend more than 96 inches in
length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To simplify field application, the exception proposed in the NPRM to permit an alternative method of measuring public
sidewalk curb ramp slope has been replaced by a limitation on the length that might result from strict application
of the maximum slope requirement for parallel public sidewalk curb ramps only. Where a running slope of 1:12 would
result in a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp more than 96 inches long when measured from a level plane, the public
sidewalk curb ramp need not exceed 96 inches in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where public sidewalks intersect, as at corners where public sidewalk curb ramps are necessary to serve street crossings,
the cross slope limitation will apply in both directions, thus providing a level landing from which to measure curb
ramp slope. Perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp slope and the slope of the parallel public sidewalk curb ramp
segment adjacent to the corner can therefore be measured from a level plane. Thus, where parallel public sidewalk
curb ramps are located at public sidewalk intersections, the ramp up or down to the landing from the intersection will
be no steeper than 1:12. On the other side of the landing, the slope may be that of the public sidewalk itself, unconstrained
along sloping rights-of-way. Where a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp is constructed at a midblock crossing along
a sloping public sidewalk, the parallel public sidewalk curb ramp may be the sloping public sidewalk itself connecting
on either side to the landing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM limited side flares to a maximum slope of 1:12 where the landing at the top of the perpendicular public sidewalk
curb ramp was less than 48 inches in length. Several commenters noted that the 1:12 limitation on side flare slope was
unnecessary in new construction since a minimum 48 inch level landing is required at the top of a curb ramp. Two commenters
recommended steeper side flares as being more distinguishable by persons with vision impairments and suggested
a 1:8 maximum. Others supporting a steeper slope for side flares noted that this would make additional public sidewalk
area available for signals, utilities, and street furnishings.

This section of the interim final rule applies only to new construction, where public sidewalk curb ramps must have
a minimum 48 inch long landing. Side flares may therefore have a maximum slope of 1:10. This will make curb ramps more
distinguishable. In alterations, where a 36 inch long landing is permitted, side flares must have a maximum slope
of 1:12.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous comments were received on the reservation of detectable warnings on public sidewalk curb ramps in the public
right-of-way. On July 9, 1993, the Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation issued
a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to suspend temporarily the requirement for detectable warnings
on curb ramps and at reflecting pools and hazardous vehicle crossings (58 FR 37052). If adopted, the provisions of
ADAAG 4.7.7 (Detectable Warnings), 4.29.5 (Detectable Warnings at Hazardous Vehicular Areas), and 4.29.6 (Detectable
Warnings at Reflecting Pools) would be suspended until January 1995. The Board is conducting further research on
detectable warnings. The requirement for detectable warnings for elements covered by ADAAG sections 4 through 10
remains in effect unless and until the Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation adopt
the proposed suspension and publish a final rule in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that the counter slope of adjacent surfaces be limited to a maximum of 1:20. Many commenters objected
to this limitation for existing gutters, which may have a slope as steep as 1:12. A few commenters noted, however, that
a 1:20 slope would be achievable in new construction. Other commenters noted that some designs of street cross sections
would preclude maintaining this slope consistently across a street crossing and suggested a limitation in length.

The angle of incidence between a wheelchair descending a public sidewalk curb ramp and the counter slope of the gutter
must be limited to avoid catching the wheelchair footrest. The 1:20 maximum required in the interim final rule is consistent
with ADAAG 4.7.2 (Slope). The interim final rule adds a requirement that the area of 1:20 slope extend for a 24 inch distance
(the length of the wheelbase of most wheelchairs) from the edge of the public sidewalk curb ramp.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM sought comment on the size, usability and maintenance of crossing control buttons. Commenters stated that
recessed or hooded buttons and very small membrane-enclosed buttons were difficult for many persons to operate.
A few commenters supported the proposed 3/4 inch provision, derived from ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators), for reasons of consistency.
Other commenters stated that they had had no problems or complaints from the 3/4 inch diameter buttons installed in
their jurisdictions. A number of municipalities indicated that larger buttons were more prone to freezing and vandalism.
However, the State of Oregon, and the Douglas County (OR) Public Works Department both indicated that two inch buttons
with integral guards posed minimal problems in cold wet climates. EPVA recommended a two inch diameter button as being
easier to operate on public sidewalks where site conditions may be less than adequate and the relationship of the button,
the public sidewalk curb ramp and landing, and the street crossing may not be optimal. Most individuals with disabilities
and organizations representing them strongly supported a button two inches or larger in diameter. The Hawaii Commission
on Persons with Disabilities noted that controls should be operable with a closed fist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several State and local government transportation and public works agencies submitted manufacturers' specifications
on crossing controls. An Australian traffic engineer submitted data on a three inch by five inch oval button with raised
arrows that indicate crossing direction. Large buttons and plates, tactile signage, and raised crossing direction
indicators were also recommended by a number of individuals who are blind. A few commenters, including the Lighthouse
for the Blind and the American Council of the Blind, suggested that a color contrast at the button would also be useful
for pedestrians with vision impairments. Other recommendations included convex and raised buttons rather than
flush installations and lever and vertical bar operators for maximum usability by persons with upper body mobility
impairments.

The interim final rule requires that crossing control buttons be larger than elevator call buttons given their outdoor
locations and the likelihood that surface conditions and location may not allow as controlled an approach as is possible
to a wall-mounted elevator button in the lobby of a building. Small buttons require greater fine motor control to operate.
A larger button that can be actuated by a slight motion or closed fist will be usable by more persons. This is particularly
important where a crossing cycle can only be actuated by operating the control. Additional issues, such as contrast,
tactile directions for use, and other button designs may be considered in future rulemaking.

The NPRM proposed that the control button be located as close as possible to a public sidewalk curb ramp. Few comments

The interim final rule requires that the horizontal distance between the approach space and the control be no more
than 10 inches for a parallel approach. This requirement is derived from ADAAG 4.2 (Space Allowance and Reach Ranges).
Both forward and parallel approaches are permitted. An appendix note recommends placing the controls out of the path
of travel along the public sidewalk.

The NPRM sought comment on the proposed 48 inch maximum mounting height for crossing controls. Most commenters favored
a lower height, in some cases as low as 32 inches. Heights of 36 inches and 42 inches were supported by organizations
representing persons with mobility impairments. EPVA recommended a 42 inch mounting height, as required for an elevator
button in ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators). MUTCD recommends a range between 42 and 48 inches. Commenters noted that controls
are mounted on a slip ring and can be easily installed at a lower height.

Where it is necessary to operate the control in order to initiate the crossing cycle, it is important that the button
be installed within a reach range that serves the greatest number of people. Therefore, the mounting height in the
interim final rule has been changed to a maximum of 42 inches.

The NPRM sought comment on specifications for audible crossing signals for persons with vision impairments and vibro-tactile
controls for those with vision and hearing impairments. A large number of comments and technical data were received.
Commenters with vision impairments cited locations and types of equipment that facilitated unassisted street crossing.
Departments of public works and similar State and local government agencies and transportation engineers from private
industry submitted reports, recommendations, warrants for installation, studies, and cost data for audible pedestrian
signals. Organizations representing persons with vision impairments, mobility instructors, and individuals
who are blind supported and opposed audible crossing signals. Some commenters noted that audible signals facilitated
safe and independent travel, particularly by those with late-onset vision impairments. Other commenters were concerned
that audible signals would mask environmental cues and stigmatize persons who are blind as needing special accommodations
in order to travel about on public sidewalks.

The interim final rule does not contain technical or scoping provisions for audible or vibro-tactile crossing signals
because of a lack of consensus on the need for these devices and the specifications they should be required to meet.
However, the material received may be of value to the Board in future rulemaking and technical assistance. Furthermore,
emerging wayfinding and broadcast signage technologies may have applications to pedestrian street crossing. Technology
that makes pedestrian information audible is being tested in several communities and facilities.

The proposed rule required marked crossings to be delineated with contrasting markings or materials. Comments from
organizations representing persons with vision impairments supported contrast requirements for marked crossings
and recommended that the final rule contain more specific requirements. Many commenters suggested additional features
for crosswalk design, including raised guidestrips, textured and resilient surfaces, and flashing lights to increase

Paragraph (4) requires ramps complying with ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps) or elevators complying with ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 An appendix note clarifies that overpasses and underpasses in hilly terrain may be approached at or near grade by public
sidewalks with a slope at or less than 1:20. Since the construction of an overcrossing or undercrossing facility offers
the opportunity to provide slopes that could not be achieved adjacent to roadways, however, grade-separated segments
must be connected to the continuous passage at each end by means of ramps or elevators.

 The NPRM sought comment on whether there were constraints specific to overpasses and underpasses for which an exception
should be allowed. Few commenters opposed accessible pedestrian overpasses and underpasses in new construction.
Several commenters, including DREDF, recommended allowing a circular ramp if site constraints made that the only
feasible option. The National Association of State Facilities Administrators (NASFA) favored an exception from
accessibility requirements where the grade differential exceeds 14 feet. ITE members and several State transportation
agencies noted that high spans may be too costly to construct to be accessible. One architect suggested that pedestrian
actuated crossing signals and crosswalks be permitted in lieu of ramps and elevators where equivalent access could
be achieved. The State of Illinois Department of Transportation recommended an exception for underpasses and overpasses
serving remote transit parking if accessible spaces were provided at the station.

) and the Department of Transportation regulation (49 CFR 27.75) implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act require that Federally funded highway construction comply with UFAS standards. Therefore, ramps have been provided
in most new grade-separated pedestrian crossings in recent years. By their nature, overcrossings and undercrossings
are costly to plan and construct. Careful planning in new construction can provide full accessibility. Furthermore,
providing accessible ramps does not have a major cost effect on overall project expenditures. An alternative at-grade
crossing for extreme differentials in grade does not seem practicable, as most overpasses and underpasses are provided
where roadways are wide, speed is high, and vehicle volume is heavy. Additionally, studies have shown that, if an alternate
shorter route is available, pedestrians will choose it in favor of a longer grade-separated structure even if it is
more dangerous. This would defeat the purpose of providing separated crossings. No exception is included for new
construction. An appendix note has been added to include information on circular ramps, which do not meet the requirements
of ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps). Transit stations are covered by ADAAG 10 (Transportation Facilities) and not as public rights-of-way

 The NPRM sought comment on whether stairs serving overpasses and underpasses that were also served by a ramp or elevator
should comply with ADAAG 4.9 (Stairs). Commenters supported such a requirement, noting that its cost effect would
be negligible because standards in most public works construction codes are similar to ADAAG 4.9 (Stairs). Commenters
noted that the benefits of increased accessibility for persons who have difficulty traversing long ramped approaches

 The NPRM proposed to include platform lifts where permitted under 4.1.3(5) as a means of access to an overpass or underpass.
Several commenters noted that platform lifts were not a realistic option in such locations because of the limitations
on run and operation imposed by ASME A17.1&hyph;1990 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, referenced in ADAAG
4.11 (Platform Lifts (Wheelchair Lifts)). EPVA also opposed platform lifts, noting that installation would require

 Under ADAAG 4.1.3(5), a platform lift (wheelchair lift) may be provided only when installation of an elevator is infeasible
because of site or other constraints. In new construction, access to overpasses and underpasses can be designed to
incorporate an elevator. The reference to ADAAG 4.1.3(5) and 4.11 (Platform Lifts (Wheelchair Lifts)) has therefore
been removed.

 To the extent that these networks are: (1) developed under the authority of a State or local government, (2) are intended
for public pedestrian access, circulation, and use, and (3) occupy, along at least some of their length, air or ground
rights in the public right-of-way, they must be accessible under this section. Because topography will not be a consideration,
it should be possible in new construction to provide a level route along the continuous passage, which will typically
connect to surface circulation networks by elevators, which may be provided in private facilities or at transit stations.
ADAAG 4.3.1 requires skywalks and tunnels that are part of an accessible route on a site or within a facility to comply
with 4.3 (Accessible Route). Where such construction lies in the public right-of-way and connects above or below
grade to the accessible routes required of facilities on private sites, these pedestrian circulation networks must
provide a continuous passage and comply with other provisions of this section. Direct connections from transit facilities
are covered by ADAAG 10.3.1(3). Additionally, elements placed along above-grade or below-grade public pedestrian
routes must comply with the requirements of ADAAG 14.

of the table and suggested applying it in a variety of ways, including block areas, block lengths (both one-sided and
two), parking districts, commercial and central business zones, or the total inventory of on-street parking in a
jurisdiction. Several comments suggested a scoping based on demonstrated need. Some commenters were concerned
that applying the table to a series of small projects with a limited number of spaces might result in an overall requirement
for more spaces. Persons with disabilities recommended applying the table to small areas in order to provide broad
dispersal, maximum convenience, and the shortest possible routes of travel. Several commenters suggested that
scoping be expanded to include parking at municipal buildings.

In new development, parking will typically be provided as part of a larger project, such as the widening of a street,
the improvement of a downtown commercial area, or the creation of a new subdivision. Therefore, the interim final
rule uses project as a basis for scoping. A new on-street parking project may be established within a discrete area
defined by several blocks and include both sides of a street or streets. Major street and public sidewalk reconstructions
will have similar characteristics. An urban block may provide as many as sixty spaces around its perimeter; a block-long
street length may average thirty for both sides together. The interim final rule requires that where new on-street
parking is provided as part of a project in commercial districts and at civic buildings, accessible spaces shall be
provided in accordance with the table at ADAAG 4.1.2(5)(a). Such spaces shall be reasonably dispersed throughout
the project area. A provision has been added that requires accessible spaces to be located where street and sidewalk
slope is minimal, to the extent that this is consistent with reasonable dispersal. A needs-based provision is not
feasible in new construction, where use levels will be initially low until full development is achieved, at which
time it might not be practicable to add accessible spaces where needed. A requirement has been added to include parking
at civic buildings.

The interim final rule provides technical provisions for parallel, perpendicular, and angled parking and requires
a wider perpendicular access aisle. Where the public pedestrian right-of-way exceeds 12 feet in width, parallel
on-street parking spaces require both perpendicular and parallel access aisles. A 60 inch wide perpendicular access
aisle must be located at the head or foot of an accessible parking space and connect to a public sidewalk curb ramp. The
perpendicular access aisle will allow unobstructed travel from accessible parking spaces to the public sidewalk
and a more generous vehicle maneuvering space. Side-loading vans may use the public sidewalk area at a standard parking
space, if unobstructed, or the public sidewalk at an accessible parking space to deploy a lift and thus are not specifically
provided for here. Many rear-loading vans will be able to use the perpendicular access aisle to deploy a lift.

A parallel access aisle provides an area for entering and exiting the vehicle outside traffic lanes. The parallel
access aisle is required to enable the driver or passenger to transfer from the vehicle. This access aisle can be located
on either side of the vehicle, depending on how the car is parked. Parallel on-street parking spaces may be indented
into the public sidewalk as are loading zones or utilize space occupied by parkways or street furnishing zones along
a curb. An exception has been added for narrower rights-of-way, where only the perpendicular access aisle and public
sidewalk curb ramp must be provided. Two parking spaces may be paired at one public sidewalk curb ramp, although the
requirement for dispersion may preclude larger groupings. Perpendicular and angled spaces are specified similar
to ADAAG 4.6 (Parking and Passenger Loading Zones). The provision for signage has been amended to include designation
of van-accessible perpendicular and angled parking spaces. Two angled parking spaces are not permitted to share
an access aisle because the parking approach may preclude backing into the space so that the access aisle is on the side
necessary for transfer.

should be provided. If accessible on-street parking is not provided at the time of expansion, it will be difficult
to add it later, when it will be needed. One commenter noted that Washington, DC and Los Angeles (CA) provide most of

These are dangers faced by all motorists exiting on the driver's side under some conditions. As in other sections of
these guidelines, access is nevertheless required to ensure choice. The proposed appendix note has been deleted.

Snow removal is a problem at every pedestrian feature, particularly at public sidewalk curb ramps and intersections.
The construction of indented parking is similar to that of loading zones provided on urban public sidewalks in many
jurisdictions and should not require different treatment.

The NPRM required that all parking meters be accessible. Most jurisdictions indicated that the parking meter they
commonly specify could not meet guidelines for operation without tight grasping or twisting and reported having
a program allowing free parking for persons displaying appropriate license plates or placards. Other commenters
saw no need for accessible meters if exemptions were available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, many commenters supported the requirement that these parking meters be accessible and pointed out that
some persons may have disabilities that make it difficult to operate controls but are not eligible for license plates
allowing free parking. These commenters further noted that only a few State programs provide full reciprocity with
other jurisdictions and that local policy on exemptions could change at any time. Commenters asserted that it would
be less costly to have a standard specification for all meters than to have to install, maintain, and collect money
from both accessible and inaccessible types.

Meters with accessible controls are available from several manufacturers at only slightly increased cost over standard
meters. Just as controls and operating mechanisms, such as door hardware, light switches, and dispenser controls,
located on an accessible route must be accessible, the controls and operating mechanisms of fixed street furnishings
along a continuous passage must also comply with ADAAG 4.27 (Controls and Operating Mechanisms). Since motorists
generally cannot choose a particular parking space, and persons with disabilities that affect their ability to grasp
and twist operating mechanisms will not always be able or need to use an accessible parking space, the requirement
that all meters be accessible has not been changed in the interim final rule.

The NPRM sought comment on the requirement for a 48 inch mounting height for parking meters. Commenters recommended
mounting heights between 32 and 48 inches. A number of commenters noted that some parking meters post hours of operation
on a horizontal surface within the casing, and that this information should be accessible to persons in wheelchairs.
Several jurisdictions noted that a lower mounting height was feasible.

Persons with disabilities may choose to use any on-street parking space that is available, even though it may not meet
the requirements for an accessible space. Therefore, the interim final rule requires a maximum mounting height of
42 inches to the operable parts of controls, consistent with requirements in ADAAG 14.2.5(1). Where accessible on-street
parking spaces with access aisles are not provided, this provision ensures that accessible meters will be available.

of the space required for a wheelchair to operate them, consistent with ADAAG side reach limits for a parallel approach.

The NPRM referenced ADAAG 4.1 through 4.35, which included 4.6.6 (Passenger Loading Zones). One commenter sought
a clarification of the number of public sidewalk curb ramps required in a passenger loading zone that serves several

The NPRM proposed that physical access be provided to callboxes. A large number of comments were received from State
and local government agencies responsible for the design, installation, and operation of motorist aid systems in
California. The California Highway Patrol submitted data on accidents involving patrol officers, disabled vehicles,
and pedestrians along high-speed roadways indicating that persons travelling along a roadway shoulder or break-down
lane are at risk and present a hazard to motorists. Commenters from transportation agencies were strongly opposed
to accessible callboxes, citing safety concerns and the difficulty of providing a continuous passage to callboxes
located along highways. Persons with disabilities and organizations representing them supported physical access
to callboxes, noting that persons with disabilities should have the same choices as other motorists needing assistance
on the highway. However, several persons with disabilities and two State organizations representing them submitted
comments favoring alternative methods of access, specifically the provision of cellular telephones. A number of
commenters favored physical accessibility to new installations in combination with alternative forms of access
to existing systems.

Callboxes that are physically accessible are available to every motorist if the need arises, allowing each motorist
to make a judgment about the advisability of using it. In new installations, it is possible, by the careful selection
of location and the application of standard engineering practices, to achieve an accessible approach without compromising
drainage, guardrail, abutment, and other criteria of highway design. Although a continuous passage from the shoulder
to the callbox is required, there is no requirement that a passage along the highway be provided. Access to existing
facilities, including callboxes, is subject to the Department of Justice regulation implementing title II of the
ADA (28 CFR 35.150(b)). No substantive changes have been made in this requirement.

Because of the likelihood and serious effect of breakdowns in tunnels or on bridges, AASHTO recommends full shoulders
in longer tunnels and a 30 inch curb or public sidewalk. A four foot shoulder is the minimum recommended for bridges
on arterials. Where motorist aid communications systems are provided in new construction, it should be possible
to provide physical access from the roadway to the callbox (e.g., with an indentation in the raised curb at the callbox).

The NPRM asked whether callboxes were available that met the five pound requirement for controls and operation. One
manufacturer of callboxes that utilize cellular telephone technology was confident that its equipment could meet
the force requirement, although it acknowledged that some changes to their current specifications might be necessary.
Another manufacturer, whose radio signal callboxes are powered by user actuation of a pull-down handle, asserted
that the mechanics of this process made it impossible to meet the five pound force without increasing the range of motion
required or impeding system reliability. The manufacturer reported that its product had been found usable by five
persons with a range of mobility impairments during independent testing by the Delaware Architectural Accessibility
Board in 1985. Several State highway agencies noted that callbox technology is now focussed on cellular telephone
communications because of greater system reliability.

Many industries have retooled to implement technological advances. While some manufacturers may have difficulty
achieving the required operating force, accessible roadside callboxes are available from several manufacturers.
Moreover, the operating force requirements in ADAAG are the same as those in UFAS, which has been in effect since 1984.
Some units that do not currently comply with the operating force requirements can be made accessible by the addition
of mechanical operating components. The increased range of motion which may be necessary can be accommodated by a
lower mounting height or by reversing the direction of lever operation. No substantive change has been made in operating
force and control provisions.

The NPRM asked questions on the mounting height of callboxes, inquiring about the feasibility of a 48 inch maximum
height rather than the standard 54 inch height. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) commented that callboxes
as low as 42 inches above finished grade would meet standards imposed by the Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. 101,
et seq.), ``*&blank;*&blank;* if callboxes are mounted on the downstream side of their supports. A breakaway support
with a callbox mounted opposite the direction of traffic will carry the callbox over the car on impact.'' While a few
commenters anticipated increased difficulty in snow removal at a lesser height and some noted guardrail and other
possible mounting impediments in existing locations, no commenter furnished information that would preclude a
lower installation. Furthermore, several commenters noted that systems currently installed in California are
mounted with the highest operable part at 54 inches, with the bottom of the receiver somewhat lower and its armored
cord within 46 inches of grade. Persons with disabilities and groups representing them recommended a lower height,
ranging from 36 to 48 inches.

Callboxes are located outdoors where surface conditions may not allow as controlled an approach as is possible to
elements installed in a building. Furthermore, persons using callboxes located as recommended by the FHWA should
be facing traffic and may be using a front approach to the device. Therefore, the interim final rule requires that the
highest operable part of a callbox be mounted no more than 48 inches above finished grade at the callbox. This height
requirement should ensure that the bottom of the callbox is at or above the 42 inch minimum recommended by FHWA.

The NPRM requested comment on programs proposed in California that would provide access to motorist aid communications
systems by means of cellular technology, and asked if these were an acceptable alternative to physical accessibility
at the callbox site. Responses were received from many Service Authorities for Freeway Emergencies (SAFE), several
State and local transportation departments, and many persons with disabilities and organizations representing
them. Although several persons with disabilities welcomed the access offered by such a program, most commenters
recommended that new callboxes be physically accessible and noted that providing cellular telephones only to persons
with disabilities was discriminatory. Other commenters noted that the logistics of such a program would be unmanageably

Most of the construction in public rights-of-way will be considered alterations and will therefore be covered by
this section rather than by ADAAG 14.2 (New Construction). Alterations occur in existing developed areas of an improved
public right-of-way where existing construction is removed or altered, whether by intention or as a consequence
of other work. The new work must meet established grades and existing construction at the project perimeter as well
as at points within its area, such as at intersecting public sidewalks, curbs and street crossings, and at entrances
to existing buildings and facilities. Alterations may occur within the physical boundaries of a project area or be
described as a project scope of work. For example, the reconstruction of a length of street and public sidewalk will
occur within a project area bounded by the limits of the public right-of-way for a stipulated distance. Within this
project area, all new work must meet guidelines for new construction to the maximum extent feasible. Other alterations
projects may consist of the installation of a typical element, such as benches or drinking fountains, dispersed throughout
a neighborhood or other general area. In such work, the scoping of accessible elements is based on individual location.
Where a single item is placed at a location, it is a common use element and must therefore be accessible.

The NPRM proposed that alterations to existing elements constructed as a part of a public improvement project comply

As discussed in ADAAG 14.1 (General), the entire section has been reorganized to address new construction and alterations
separately. Provisions derived from ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations) have been added to this section
to clarify applications to public rights-of-way. These requirements (1) prohibit decreasing the accessibility
of existing pedestrian facilities; (2) require full accessibility to public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps,
and pedestrian street crossings within a project area if a series of small alterations has the overall effect of a reconstruction;
and (3) require alteration projects involving public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps, and street crossings
to include alterations necessary to connect to adjacent portions of the continuous passage, to the extent it is not
disproportionate in cost and scope. The latter requirement is based upon ADAAG 4.1.6(2) (Alterations to an Area Containing
a Primary Function), which requires that alterations that affect or could affect the usability of or access to an area
of primary function be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area,
and certain elements serving that area, be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless
such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope. Public sidewalks, including
the continuous passage, public sidewalk curb ramps, and pedestrian street crossings are the areas of primary function
in a pedestrian circulation network. Accordingly, when any of these elements is altered, the scope of work may need
to be expanded to include accessible connections to existing work. For example, when a new public sidewalk curb ramp
is constructed, existing contiguous areas of the public sidewalk must be altered to ensure that the newly-placed
public sidewalk curb ramp complies to the maximum extent feasible with the provisions required of public sidewalk
curb ramps in new construction, if it can be done by the expenditure of an additional 20 percent of the cost of this alteration.
However, alterations in the public right-of-way that do not affect these elements or the continuous passage would
not incur a path of travel obligation. For example, the addition of accessible benches at an intersection will not
require the provision of a continuous passage or other accessible elements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure smooth transitions and structural integrity, public works specifications typically require
that finished surfaces adjacent to altered work be removed and replaced beyond the minimum necessary to perform the
work. Therefore, most jurisdictions already include improvements necessary to blend new work with existing surfaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The replacement of one flag, square, or section of public sidewalk paving within a larger area to remedy damage to,
or deterioration of, a limited area is considered maintenance and repair unless a substantial area or significant
element is involved. Alterations are generally planned as improvement projects and will be placed or constructed
according to plans and specifications. Maintenance and repair items, however, are typically governed by work orders
that assume an in-kind replacement of materials and surfaces that does not require detailed planning. As required
by ADAAG 14.4 (Temporary Work), temporary repairs to public sidewalks must meet the surface requirements of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special technical provisions for alterations derived from ADAAG 4.1.6(3) (Special Technical Provisions for Alterations

Sidewalk reconstruction on ``continuous accessible routes'' in central business districts is often difficult
due to the need to adjust the cross-slopes and the longitudinal grades to meet the ADAAG requirements. Existing curb
line grades and the need to meet existing entrances in buildings abutting the back edge of the sidewalks impose many
physical restrictions. Also, there may be underground structures (drainage, utilities, freight elevator entrances,
subway and subway access structures) or other obstacles which may preclude full compliance with the ADAAG cross-slope
requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where site infeasibility precludes full compliance with provisions for new construction, public entities must
provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible, regardless of the accessibility of adjacent areas or other
features. For example, an existing narrow public sidewalk being altered may be relieved of the obligation for a 36
inch width, if site infeasibility precludes it, but must nevertheless comply with limitations on cross slope, surface,
and separation, to the maximum extent feasible. The interim final rule contains technical provisions for specific
features that affect the accessibility of public sidewalks, public sidewalk curb ramps, and on-street parking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ADAAG 4.1.2(1) (Accessible Sites and Exterior Facilities: New Construction) requires that at least one accessible
route be provided from public streets and public sidewalks to an accessible building entrance. ADAAG 4.3 (Accessible
Route) limits cross slope on accessible routes to 1:50. However, the public sidewalk or continuous passage may have
a running slope that exceeds 1:50. In practice, the connection between sidewalks on sites and the public sidewalk
is commonly warped over a short distance to provide a smoothly blended transition. In some cases, the warping can be
accommodated on the adjacent site. In others, however, it may be necessary to warp the public sidewalk or continuous
passage in order to provide level landings at entrances and at other elements requiring access. A special technical
provision has been added to permit warping and blending of existing public sidewalks where site infeasibility precludes
a continuous cross slope of 1:50. For example, the continuous passage within an existing public sidewalk wider than
36 inches may be ramped perpendicular to its run to serve existing entrances and other accessible elements.

Paragraph (2) modifies the requirements of ADAAG 14.2.2 (Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps) for type, width, landings,
slope, and surfaces in alterations. It requires the maximum feasible accessibility of each public sidewalk curb
ramp feature where site infeasibility precludes full compliance with new construction provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) specifies the type of public sidewalk curb ramp permitted in alterations depending on the width of existing
right-of-way and other existing conditions. Unlike new construction, this section permits diagonal public sidewalk
curb ramps and built-up public sidewalk curb ramps. Paragraph (b) permits public sidewalk curb ramps in narrow public
sidewalks to be less than 36 inches wide where site infeasibility precludes compliance with new construction requirements.
Paragraph (c) permits perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps to have a minimum 36 inch long landing at the top (where
the landing of a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp is less than 48 inches in width, side flares may not exceed
1:12) and parallel public sidewalk curb ramps to have a minimum 48 inch long landing at the bottom. Cross slope may be
measured perpendicular to the curb. Under conditions of site infeasibility, the minimum feasible cross slope may
be provided. Paragraph (d) permits certain exceptions to slope limitations in public sidewalk curb ramps. Paragraph
(e) permits existing gratings and appurtenances to be retained in public sidewalk curb ramps and landings if relocation
is infeasible and permits crowning or projecting public sidewalk curb ramp surfaces at streets and gutters that exceed
a 1:20 slope.

 The NPRM proposed a sequential series of exceptions for public sidewalk curb ramps based upon right-of-way width.
Many commenters recommended additional types of public sidewalk curb ramps, such as combinations of parallel and
perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps. Individuals with disabilities and groups representing them strongly
favored a requirement for a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp in all cases where a landing could be provided.
Where a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp could not be provided with a landing because of narrow public sidewalks,
these commenters preferred a requirement for a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp. Several jurisdictions submitted
standard curb ramp specifications that were also based upon differences in right-of-way width.

 A few municipalities in Texas have noted that their existing public sidewalks are elevated 18 to 27 inches above the
level of the surrounding streets. Street crossings are reached by steps that may have risers of nine inches or more.
The municipalities were concerned about means of providing ramped access under such conditions.

 New construction and alterations provisions are based upon a curb height of six inches, the common public works standard.
However, newly constructed curb heights may range between 2-1/2 inches for a combination rolled curb and gutter section
to as much as nine inches on bridge and overpass construction, where future resurfacing may have to be taken into account
when establishing finished grades. Alterations involving changes in level that exceed commonly-specified curb
heights cannot be accommodated by typical public sidewalk curb ramp designs. In such cases it may be possible to provide
access with ramps complying with ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps) within the width of the public sidewalk. Where public sidewalk
levels diverge, a railing or other edge protection is advisable.

 Several commenters, including persons with disabilities, supported a requirement for public sidewalk curb ramps
even when existing site conditions would require a steeply sloped or very narrow parallel public sidewalk curb ramp.
Most commenters supported a requirement for a 36 inch continuous passage by a public sidewalk curb ramp but did not
support a 36 inch landing at the top of the public sidewalk curb ramp because it was too narrow to make a turn. These commenters
also supported cross slope limitations at 1:50. Most State and local governments, however, recommended that exceptions
be provided for narrow rights-of-way and existing public sidewalks with excessive cross slope.

 The interim final rule permits a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp in a public sidewalk that is less than 36 inches
wide. It also permits a minimum 36 inch landing in alterations to maximize the usability of perpendicular public sidewalk
curb ramps constructed in existing developed rights-of-way. A 36 inch landing will accommodate the wheelbase of
most wheelchairs and additional maneuvering space for a footrest may be available adjacent to public sidewalks to
facilitate a turn at the top landing. Consistent with ADAAG 4.7 (Curb Ramps), the slope of side flares at public sidewalk
curb ramps with landings less than 48 inches in length has been limited to 1:12. Landing slopes may be measured perpendicular
to the curb face when a level landing cannot be provided. When site constraints preclude a 1:50 slope, the minimum feasible
slope must be provided in both directions across a landing.

 The interim final rule permits public sidewalk curb ramps to be steeper than permitted by 14.3.2(2)(d) (i) and (ii)
if a ramp complying with those provisions would extend more than 72 inches in length. To simplify field application,
the alternative form of measurement has been eliminated and replaced by a straightforward limitation on the length
that might be required as a result of the application of the maximum slope. Where the running slopes permitted in the
special technical provisions could result in a public sidewalk curb ramp more than 72 inches long when measured from
a level plane, the public sidewalk curb ramp need not extend more than 72 inches in length.

 Several commenters recommended that public sidewalk curb ramps be crowned or projected (built-up) beyond the curb
face where existing gutter counter slope exceeds 1:20. This recommendation is also included in the APWA/AGC Standard
Plans for Public Works Construction. This may avoid major alterations to adjacent gutters and curbs when a public

 The NPRM included an appendix note describing on-street parallel parking spaces without access aisles that utilize
adjacent public sidewalk curb ramps. Several commenters from public works agencies discouraged on-street parallel
parking adjacent to intersections, where sight distance may be limited, because of the danger from turning vehicles
to persons transferring from parked cars into wheelchairs. However, persons with disabilities noted that even though
such spaces did not have access aisles, they were preferable to none at all. Many municipalities indicated that they
had provided such spaces with a positive response from persons with disabilities.

 In existing developed rights-of-way, on-street parallel parking spaces without access aisles may be the only spaces
some jurisdictions can provide. While such spaces do not provide a high degree of accessible features, they are usable
by many persons with disabilities. The interim final rule includes the proposed appendix note as a special technical

 The NPRM proposed that temporary work comply with ADAAG 4.1.1(4) (Temporary Structures), which applies the scope
and technical requirements of ADAAG, including those for an accessible route, to temporary facilities. The NPRM
further proposed that the temporary circulation path from building entrances to accessible street crossings be
clearly marked. Several commenters from departments of public works noted that it may not always be possible to provide
an accessible temporary route. Others recommended that an alternate route be required, particularly to building
entrances. One commenter stated that the cost of providing an accessible alternate route might be excessive in some
situations.

 Consistent with ADAAG 14.2.1, which requires that public sidewalks, where provided, be accessible, this section
has been changed to require that where a temporary alternate circulation path is provided around construction in
the public pedestrian circulation network, the alternate path must be accessible. It also requires that the temporary
alternate circulation path comply with alterations standards at ADAAG 14.3 (Alterations). The reference to ADAAG
4.1.1(4) (Temporary Structures) has been removed as unnecessary. The provision at ADAAG 14.1 (General) applies

 Several commenters noted that, where construction involves the entire width of a public sidewalk, some pedestrians
may choose to bypass the work by using the adjacent roadway for a short distance. These commenters requested clarification
as to whether permitting the use of a street or public sidewalk by pedestrians without disabilities constituted the
provision of an alternate circulation path that would require the temporary installation of public sidewalk curb
ramps to allow persons using wheelchairs to travel in the street to detour around an obstruction.

 Along developed rights-of-way, access to other existing routes may already be available at nearby intersections
where pedestrians can choose to cross to another public sidewalk that will provide temporary passage by the construction.
This would not require the provision of a temporary alternate circulation path. However, where other existing routes
are not available and where the sidewalk under construction remains open to pedestrian travel but does not provide
a continuous passage, an accessible temporary path must be provided. The temporary path must comply with provisions
for alterations in ADAAG 14.3 and must therefore contain a continuous passage connecting to public sidewalk curb
ramps and street crossings, where necessary for access. Furthermore, the temporary alternate path must be clearly
noted and, where there are hazardous conditions along the route, such as excavations, construction materials, or
equipment, they must be protected by barriers.

 The NPRM proposed that construction sites in the public right-of-way be protected with barriers. Commenters from
FHWA noted that MUTCD contained requirements for street and highway construction, including traffic and pedestrian
barriers. (DOT/FHWA, ``Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices,'' 1988 edition.) These commenters recommended
that the requirements of this section be coordinated with chapter 6C&hyph;9, Barricade Application, which recommends
that, where it is not possible to divert pedestrians to other public sidewalks when a segment of a pedestrian route
is impassable due to construction, barricades be used to define an alternate path.

 Conformance with MUTCD standards, which include technical guidelines for barricade design and designation, is
required as a condition for receiving funding under the Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. 101, et seq). Therefore,
most jurisdictions will comply with MUTCD guidelines. The interim final rule is consistent with MUTCD recommendations
and no changes have been made in this requirement.

Under both the Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Access Board provides technical
assistance and training for entities covered under the acts. The Access Board's toll-free number allows callers
to receive technical assistance and to order publications. The Access Board conducts in-depth training programs
to advise and educate the general public, as well as architects and other professionals on the accessibility guidelines
and requirements. In addition, the Board is developing two manuals for use by both technical and general audiences.
The first is a general manual on ADAAG requirements that will be a useful tool in understanding ADAAG whether for purposes
of compliance or as a reference for accessible design. The second is a technical assistance manual on the application
of accessibility requirements for public sidewalks, curb ramps, street crossings and related pedestrian facilities
in the public right-of-way. This manual will assist public works, streets and engineering, and similar State and
local government agencies responsible for street and sidewalk improvements. The manual will also be of use to architects,
civil engineers, landscape architects and other professionals who provide design services for pedestrian improvements
under contract to public agencies and to construction firms who make the physical improvements. The manual on the
application of accessibility requirements for public rights-of-ways will be coordinated with the publication
of final rules by the Access Board and the Departments of Justice and Transportation. The more general manual on ADAAG
will be available as soon as possible after the publication of the final rules.

Regulatory Assessment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These guidelines are issued to provide guidance to the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation
in establishing accessibility standards for new construction and alterations of State and local government facilities
covered by title II of the ADA. The standards established by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation
must be consistent with these guidelines. These guidelines meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866 and this interim final rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant
to that order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has prepared a Regulatory Assessment (RA) which has been placed in the docket and is available for public
inspection at the Board's office. The RA includes a cost impact analysis for certain accessibility elements and a
discussion of the regulatory alternatives considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accessibility does not generally add features to a building or a facility but rather simply requires that features
commonly provided have certain characteristics. Some of the characteristics may add marginally to the cost of an
element; however, the cost for installation is not usually increased. In addition, accessibility generally adds
little or no space to buildings and facilities. Several studies discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis prepared
for ADAAG on January 9, 1992 have shown that designing buildings and facilities to be accessible, from the conceptual
phase onward, adds less than one percent to the total construction costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the RA, the Board analyzed those provisions that pertain only to buildings and facilities which are
covered by title II of ADA. Included in the analysis were: adaptable fixed judges' benches and clerk's stations, accessible
jury boxes and witness stands, speakers' rostrums and raised daises, security systems, wiring and conduit for communication
systems, restricted and secured entrances, visiting areas, cells, cubicles, platform lifts and elevators, passing
space on sidewalks, crossing controls, motorist aid communication systems, on-street parking, principal and primary
entrances, and swimming pools. The RA also discusses the indirect costs of the accessibility elements such as maintenance,
operation and opportunity costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is particularly interested in estimating the aggregate (nationwide) annual cost of this rule. In order
to do so, the Board would need to calculate, for each category of facility, the product of (1) the cost of each individual
requirement and (2) the number of times each requirement applies within the ``average'' facility and (3) the number
of facilities affected each year. The Board has included reasonable estimates for the cost of individual requirements
in the RA, and is requesting, for each class of facility (i.e., courthouses, correctional facilities, residential
facilities, public rights-of-way), data on the extent to which each specific requirement will apply within the ``average''
facility. Additionally, the Board is requesting data on the number of affected facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the publication of a rule requires the preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis if such rule could have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These guidelines
will have such an impact. Section 605(A) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act permits an agency to satisfy the flexibility
analysis requirement by addressing the impacts of the rule on small entities in the agency's RA. The Board has chosen
to exercise that option and has addressed the impact of the guidelines on small entities as part of the RA. The economic
impacts imposed upon the small entities subject to the guidelines are the necessary result of the ADA statute itself.
Every effort has been made by the Board to lessen the economic impact of this rule on small entities, but little discretion
was reserved to the Board in this area.

These guidelines will have some Federalism impacts. The impacts imposed upon State and local government entities
are the necessary result of the ADA statute itself. Every effort has been made by the Board to lessen the impact of these
guidelines on State and local government entities, but little discretion was reserved to the Board in this area. The
RA discusses the impact of these guidelines on public entities. This discussion serves the purposes of a Federalism
Statement under Executive Order 12612 for purposes of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the supplementary information above, on December 21, 1992, the Board published an NPRM in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which proposed to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (36 CFR part 1191) by adding
four special application sections and miscellaneous provisions specifically applicable to buildings and facilities
covered by title II of the ADA. Executive Order 12875, Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership, encourages
Federal agencies to consult with State and local governments affected by the implementation of legislation. It has
been determined that these guidelines will have an economic impact on such entities. Accordingly, following the
issuance of the NPRM, the Board held five public hearings in major cities across the country. Notices of the hearings
and invitations to attend were sent to major state and local government entities in those areas. In addition, copies
of the NPRM were mailed directly to major associations of state and local governmental entities across the country
and various responsible agencies in individual states. In response to the NPRM and the public hearings, a total of
148 people presented testimony on the proposed guidelines, 447 written comments were submitted to the Board by the
end of the comment period, and an additional 127 comments were received after the close of the comment period. Although
the latter comments were not timely, the Board considered them to the extent practicable. Two hundred and five of the
comments and testimony received were from affected State and local governments. Those comments were carefully analyzed
and the major issues are discussed in the Section by Section Analysis, which also indicates the Board's position on
each issue. Additionally, cost concerns raised by those entities are further addressed in the Regulatory Assessment.
A copy of the NPRMs published by the Departments of Justice and Transportation, as well as the Access Board's Interim
Final Rule and the Regulatory Assessment prepared in connection with the rule will be forwarded to major State and
local government associations and agencies for their review and comment. Additional copies of the Regulatory Assessment
are available on request.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this final rule, RSPA is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) by revising the ``List of Hazardous
Substances and Reportable Quantities'' which appears in an Appendix to the hazardous materials table. This action
is necessary to comply with the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, which amended the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to mandate that RSPA regulate, under the
HMR, all hazardous substances designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The intended effect of this
action is to enable shippers and carriers to identify CERCLA hazardous substances, thereby enabling them to comply
with all applicable HMR requirements and to make the required notifications if a discharge of a hazardous substance
occurs.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 202 of SARA (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499) amended Section 306(a) of CERCLA (Pub. L. 96&hyph;510), 42 U.S.C. 9656(a),
by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to list and regulate hazardous substances, listed or designated under
Section 101(14) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), as hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act (HMTA; 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). RSPA carries out the rulemaking responsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation
under the HMTA. 49 CFR 1.53(b). This final rule is necessary to comply with 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) as amended by Section 202
of SARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In carrying out that statutory mandate, RSPA has no discretion to determine what is or is not a hazardous substance
or the appropriate reportable quantity (RQ) for materials designated as hazardous substances. This authority is
vested in EPA. Therefore, under the CERCLA scheme EPA must issue final rules amending the list of CERCLA hazardous
substances, including adjusting RQ's, before RSPA can amend its list of hazardous substances. In the preamble to
the final rule on this subject issued under Docket HM&hyph;145F (51 FR 42174; November 21, 1986), RSPA included the
following statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is RSPA's intention to make changes from time to time to the list of hazardous substances or their RQ's in the Appendix
as adjustments are made by EPA.

This document adjusts the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities'' that appears in Appendix A
to &sect;172.101, based on several final rules EPA has published. On November 2, 1990 (55 FR 46354), EPA published
a final rule which added the waste codes F037 and F038 to the list of hazardous substances with RQ's of 1 pound. On December
6, 1990 (55 FR 50450), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes FO32, F034, and F035 to the list of hazardous
substances with RQ's of 1 pound. On August 18, 1992 (57 FR 37194), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes
K141, K142, K143, K144, K145, K147 and K148 to the list of hazardous substances with RQ's of 1 pound. On October 15, 1992
(57 FR 47376), EPA published a final rule which added the waste codes K149, K150 and K151 to the list of hazardous substances,
with RQ's of 10 pounds. On June 30, 1993 (58 FR 35314), EPA published a final rule which revised the RQ for 34 hazardous
substances. These substances include lead metal, 12 lead compounds, 15 waste streams that contain lead, characteristic
wastes that fail the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure based on their lead constituents, and methyl isocyanate.
The following table identifies those substances that have had their RQ's revised.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To keep its ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities'' consistent with EPA's list of CERCLA hazardous
substances and reportable quantities, RSPA is amending the HMR in accordance with these EPA final rules. In addition,
RSPA is making several non-substantive editorial changes to its ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities.''
The RQ for ``diethylhexyl phthalate'' is being revised to correctly read 100 pounds. In addition, RSPA is adding ``methyl
ethyl ketone'' to the list of hazardous substances as a synonym for ``methyl ethyl ketone (MEK).'' RSPA is also amending
the entry for DO41 to correctly read ``D041 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol.'' Finally, RSPA is removing the footnote ``*''
from the list of hazardous substances. The footnote ``*'' symbolized that an entry also appeared in the Hazardous
Materials Table in 49 CFR 172.101 (HMT) as a proper shipping name. However, the numerous changes to the HMT promulgated
under Docket No. HM&hyph;181 on December 21, 1990 (55 FR 52401) make it impractical to determine if those entries in
the list of hazardous substances marked with the ``*'' are still proper shipping names in the revised HMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paragraphs preceding the lists of hazardous substances are also editorially revised to indicate that the list
of hazardous substances: (1) fulfills the requirement under CERCLA that all hazardous substances be listed and regulated
as hazardous materials under the HMTA; and (2) includes substances listed under the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, Clean Air Act, and those substances designated by the Administrator of EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, common and contract carriers are informed that they may be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for
the release of a hazardous substance during transportation that commenced before the effective date of the listing
and regulating of that substance under the HMTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking will enable shippers and carriers to identify CERCLA hazardous substances and thereby enable them
to comply with all applicable HMR requirements and to make the required notifications if a discharge of a hazardous
substance occurs. In addition to the reporting requirements of the HMR found in &sect;&sect;171.15 and 171.16, a
discharge of a hazardous substance is subject to EPA reporting requirements at 40 CFR 302.6 and may be subject to the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard at 33 CFR 153.203. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rulemaking makes numerous modifications to the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities''
found in Appendix A to &sect;172.101, RSPA is reprinting ``Table 1_Hazardous Substances Other than Radionuclides''
in its entirety.

II. Regulatory Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), RSPA has determined that a notice of
proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment and review are impracticable and unnecessary. SARA mandates
that the Department of Transportation list and regulate, as hazardous materials under 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180,
hazardous substances designated by EPA under CERCLA. EPA is the sole agency authorized to designate hazardous substances
and their reportable quantities. Therefore, public comment and review are unnecessary because: (1) The public was
afforded time to comment when EPA published its notice of proposed rulemaking concerning that agency's change in
the subject RQ's; and (2) RSPA does not have the authority to designate hazardous substances or determine their reportable
quantities.

Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and,
therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the
regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). The economic impact of this
final rule is minimal to the extent that preparation of a regulatory evaluation is not warranted.

Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
(``Federalism''). The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act contains an express preemption provision (49 App.
U.S.C. 1804(a)4)) that preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements on certain covered subjects. Covered
subjects are: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
(i) the designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous materials and requirements
respecting the number, content, and placement of such documents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) the written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
materials; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) the design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation
of hazardous materials. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This final rule concerns the designation of hazardous materials. This final rule preempts State, local, or Indian
tribe requirements in accordance with the standards set forth above. The HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(5)) provides
that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine
and publish in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date
of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective
date of Federal preemption for these requirements will be [insert date 90 days after date of publication]. This rule
is mandated by CERCLA, and does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

Appendix A to &sect;172.101_List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This Appendix lists materials and their corresponding reportable quantities (RQ's) that are listed or designated
as ``hazardous substances'' under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) (CERCLA; 42 U.S.C. 9601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). This listing fulfills the requirement of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), that all ``hazardous substances,'' as defined
in 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), be listed and regulated as hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act. That definition includes substances listed under sections 311(b)(2)(A) and 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A) and 1317(a), section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921, and
section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412. In addition, this list contains materials that the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to be hazardous substances in accordance with section 102
of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9602. It should be noted that 42 U.S.C. 9656(b) provides that common and contract carriers may
be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance as defined in that Act, during transportation
that commenced before the effective date of the listing and regulating of that substance as a hazardous material under
the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This Appendix is divided into two TABLES which are entitled ``TABLE 1_HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES''
and ``TABLE 2_RADIONUCLIDES.'' A material listed in this Appendix is regulated as a hazardous material and a hazardous
substance under this subchapter if it meets the definition of a hazardous substance in &sect;171.8 of this subchapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The procedure for selecting a proper shipping name for a hazardous substance is set forth in &sect;172.101(c)(8).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Column 1 of TABLE 1, entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
``Hazardous substance'',
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 contains the names of those elements and compounds that are hazardous substances. Following the listing of elements
and compounds is a listing of waste streams. These waste streams appear on the list in numerical sequence and are referenced
by the appropriate ``D'', ``F'' or ``K'' numbers. Column 2 of TABLE 1, entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Synonyms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'', contains the names of synonyms for certain elements and compounds listed in Column 1. No synonyms are listed for
waste streams. Synonyms are useful in identifying hazardous substances and in identifying proper shipping names.
Column 3 of TABLE 1, entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Reportable quantity (RQ)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'', contains the reportable quantity (RQ), in pounds and kilograms, for each hazardous substance listed in Column
1 of TABLE 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A series of notes is used throughout TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 to provide additional information concerning certain hazardous
substances. These notes are explained at the end of each TABLE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. TABLE 2 lists radionuclides that are hazardous substances and their corresponding RQ's. The RQ's in Table 2 for
radionuclides are expressed in units of curies and terabecquerels, whereas those in Table 1 are expressed in units
of pounds and kilograms. If a material is listed in both Table 1 and Table 2, the lower RQ shall apply. Radionuclides
are listed in alphabetical order. The RQ's for radionuclides are given in the radiological unit of measure of curie,
abbreviated ``Ci'', followed, in parentheses, by an equivalent unit measured in terabecquerels, abbreviated ``TBq''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. For mixtures of radionuclides, the following requirements shall be used in determining if a package contains an
RQ of a hazardous substance: (i) if the identity and quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of each radionuclide in
a mixture or solution is known, the ratio between the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) and the RQ
for the radionuclide must be determined for each radionuclide. A package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance when
the sum of the ratios for the radionuclides in the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than one; (ii) if the identity
of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known but the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) of
one or more of the radionuclides is unknown, an RQ of a hazardous substance is present in a package when the total quantity
(in curies or terabecquerels) of the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than the lowest RQ of any individual
radionuclide in the mixture or solution; and (iii) if the identity of one or more radionuclides in a mixture or solution
is unknown (or if the identity of a radionuclide by itself is unknown), an RQ of a hazardous substance is present when
the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) in a package is equal to or greater than either one curie or the lowest
RQ of any known individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution, whichever is lower.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau, in this final rule, is amending a portion of its existing guidelines for the medical and administrative
management of inmates who engage in hunger strikes. This rule amends the previous rule by designating a physician
as responsible for determining the condition of an inmate, as well as making various other decisions concerning the
inmate. Other administrative changes have been made to assist staff in the proper handling of this medically related
issue. The rule is in accordance with the Bureau's mission to provide essential medical, dental, and mental health
services to inmates by professional staff, consistent with community standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Inmate Hunger Strikes. A final rule on this subject was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 4, 1980 (45 FR 23365). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 549.62 state that staff shall refer to medical staff for evaluation and, when appropriate,
for treatment, an inmate who is observed to be on a hunger strike. These regulations also stipulate that when considered
medically appropriate, medical staff shall place an inmate engaged in a hunger strike in a hospital. Also, when isolation
is necessary to measure food and liquid intake/output, medical staff may place the inmate in a locked hospital or other
medically appropriate room. Paragraph (a) of this section has been amended for editorial clarity and to include a
reference to mental health staff. Paragraph (b) has been revised to specify that medical staff shall place an inmate
engaged in a hunger strike in a medically appropriate locked room for close monitoring. The reasons for the revision
to paragraph (b) are both semantic and operational. Some Bureau facilities, identified as Medical Referral Centers,
are the equivalent of hospitals. The remaining Bureau of Prisons facilities more typically include health service
units; these units are not hospitals, although they may be commonly referred to as such. Removing the reference to
a hospital room therefore is more accurate in describing actual practice at typical Bureau facilities. Section 549.63
(d) separately requires that inmates be transferred to Bureau Medical Referral Centers, other institutions considered
to be medically appropriate, or to community hospitals when medical staff consider it medically mandatory. Section
549.62 (b) is intended to provide for the initial operational management of a hunger strike where the patient faces
no immediate or obvious medical risk. The requirement for use of a locked room in all cases is deemed necessary for reasons
of institution security and is intended to ensure the integrity of monitoring by medical staff. The revised section
does not preclude a health services unit room from being used for this purpose; it does, however, allow for the use of
other rooms. Regardless of the location, Bureau medical staff are responsible for determining that the room meets
the medical needs of the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
References to specific medical procedures in &sect;549.63 (a)(6) and (7) have been replaced by more general statements
(i.e., radiographs and laboratory studies as clinically indicated). This has been done to allow medical staff flexibility
in using available medical technology. Paragraph (c) of this section is amended to specify that the physician is responsible
for making various decisions. This paragraph had previously designated medical staff as being responsible. Paragraph
(d) had stated that when medical staff consider it necessary in order to provide appropriate medical treatment, an
inmate on a hunger strike will be transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, to another Bureau institution
considered medically appropriate, or to a community hospital. The amendment to this rule stipulates that when medical
staff consider it medically mandatory, an inmate on a hunger strike will be transferred to a Medical Referral Center.
This amendment is necessary to reflect the increase in the number of available Bureau medical facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 549.64 state that an inmate may not make commissary purchases while under hunger strike
management. The amendment to this rule states that an inmate may not make commissary food purchases while under hunger
strike management. This change clarifies that an inmate on a hunger strike is prohibited only from making food purchases
from the commissary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 549.65 also state that a medical officer determines if the inmate's life or permanent
health will be threatened if treatment is not initiated immediately or if forced medical treatment is necessary.
The amended regulations stipulate that a physician make these determinations. The amended regulations provide
an even greater assurance that a medical professional will handle this medically related issue and that the inmate
will receive proper care even though not necessarily in a hospital. Section 549.66 has been similarly amended for
the same reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the heading of 28 CFR 549.60 has been revised for editorial reasons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the amendments are not seen as being more restrictive on inmates, but rather deemed necessary for the continued
provision of quality medical care, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay
in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited
address. These comments will be considered, but will not receive response in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the Mexican fruit fly regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment for
grapefruit. This proposed action would provide an alternative treatment for grapefruit that require treatment
to be moved interstate from regulated areas in Texas and California. Adding this treatment would facilitate the interstate
movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mexican fruit fly, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Anastrepha ludens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Loew), is a destructive pest of citrus and other types of fruit. The short life cycle of the Mexican fruit fly allows
rapid development of serious outbreaks that can cause severe economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to prevent the artificial spread of the Mexican fruit fly to noninfested areas, the regulations in 7 CFR 301.64
(referred to below as the regulations) restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas
in quarantined States. Quarantined States are listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.64(a), regulated articles are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;2, and regulated areas are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;3(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated area in a quarantined State into or through American Samoa,
Arizona, California, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Louisiana, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Texas, or the
U.S. Virgin Islands only if the movement is in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the regulations. Under
&sect;301.64&hyph;4 of the regulations, a regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated area in a quarantined
State into or through those areas only if it is accompanied by a certificate or limited permit issued in accordance
with &sect;301.64&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in &sect;301.64&hyph;5 state, in part, that a certificate may be issued for the interstate movement
of a regulated article if an inspector determines that the regulated article is free from the Mexican fruit fly, or
that the premises of origin is free from the Mexican fruit fly and the regulated article has not been exposed to the pest.
Regulated articles are most often certified for interstate movement in one of these ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there are cases where a regulated article or its premises of origin cannot be determined to be free from the
Mexican fruit fly. In such cases, a certificate will be issued if the regulated article is treated in accordance with
&sect;301.64&hyph;10, or a limited permit may be obtained to move the regulated article interstate to receive one
of the treatments specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.64&hyph;10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the regulations provide cold treatment and methyl bromide fumigation as treatments for grapefruit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Citrus paradisi)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, one of the regulated articles listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;2. We are proposing to add a high-temperature forced
air treatment to &sect;301.64&hyph;10 as an optional treatment for grapefruit. This high-temperature forced air
treatment was developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an effective
alternative treatment against the Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment is administered in a sealed, insulated chamber on grapefruit that are at least 3.5 inches (9 centimeters)
in diameter, weigh at least 9.25 ounces (262 grams), and have an initial pulp temperature of at least 77 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). The air in the chamber is then heated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To 104 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 120 minutes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To 122 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 90 minutes; then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To 126 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (52 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), where the temperature is maintained until the grapefruit center reaches 118 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (48 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air may be heated in the chamber, or hot air may be introduced into the chamber. The treatment schedule includes
a warning that grapefruit larger than 3.7 inches (9.5 centimeters) in diameter and 14.2 ounces (402 grams) in weight
may suffer cosmetic damage as a result of this treatment because of the longer times needed to reach the required temperatures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adding this treatment would facilitate the interstate movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment to
the list of approved treatments for Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,500 citrus grove owners and 50 shippers who would benefit by having an additional treatment
option for grapefruit to be moved interstate from a regulated area. It appears unlikely that adding another treatment
would increase the amount of grapefruit moved from regulated areas in Texas and California because most citrus and
other regulated articles moved interstate by owners and shippers qualify for movement without requiring treatment.
Treatment becomes necessary only when the regulated articles or their premises of origin cannot be certified as being
free from Mexican fruit fly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cold treatment and methyl bromide fumigation are the two treatments currently available for grapefruit. The availability
of the high-temperature forced air treatment would simply provide another treatment option when treatment is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by order of the FCA Board (Board), reproposes a rule amending its regulations
governing the referral of known or suspected criminal violations. The proposed regulation was originally published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 13, 1992 (57 FR 46819). The objective of this reproposed regulation is, in part, to promote efficiencies
and timeliness in reporting, investigating, and prosecuting known or suspected criminal activities within Farm
Credit System (FCS or System) institutions. Therefore, this reproposed regulation would require System institutions
to notify law enforcement agencies of known or suspected criminal violations that meet the threshold reporting limits.
Generally, a criminal violation must be reported under this part if the borrower/shareholder or insider has an intent
to ``defraud'' a System institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reproposed regulation would also mandate the continued use of the existing criminal Referral Form. System institutions
should expect this form to be replaced with a new FCA Criminal Referral Form in the future. The existing criminal Referral
Form or any replacement form is referred to hereinafter as Referral Form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that the regulation should be reproposed due to the lapse of time since the proposed rule was originally
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (October 13, 1992). Although the reproposed rule incorporates many of the comments received in response to the proposed
rule, the FCA Board also believes that the public should be given another opportunity to comment due to the number of
changes proposed and the level of interest in the issues. To the extent that commenters wish to comment on the dollar
thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities or an institution's cost of complying with the regulation,
the FCA requests that commenters provide pertinent empirical data in support of their comments.

I. Decision to repropose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation was published (57 FR 46819) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 13, 1992. The comment period for the proposed regulation amending part 617 closed on November 12, 1992.
The FCA received two letters on the proposed regulation. The Farm Credit Council (Council), on behalf of its membership,
provided comments and suggestions on the wording and requirements of the proposed regulation. The FCA also received
a letter from the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore adopting the Council's comments. Many of the commenters' suggestions
were incorporated to improve clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council requested, among other things, that the FCA Board republish the proposed regulation. The FCA Board agrees
that the proposed regulation should be republished to afford the public another opportunity to comment. All comments
submitted to date have been considered and responded to concerning the proposed regulation. Responses to these comments
are detailed below, and corresponding changes were made to the proposed regulation in many instances. The commenters
also addressed whether the dollar thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities should be increased.
One of the stated reasons to raise the thresholds was to limit the perceived reporting burden that would result from
implementation of the proposed thresholds. It was believed that if the reporting thresholds were increased, the
reporting burden would decrease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those commenters who wish to comment again on the dollar thresholds are requested to provide any pertinent empirical
information that would indicate that the thresholds should be increased. Commenters who address the cost of complying
with the proposed regulation, e.g., time and cost of investigating and completing the Referral Form under existing
thresholds in part 617 and the proposed thresholds, should also provide pertinent empirical information in support
of their comments.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, the FCA regulates and examines FCS institutions for safety and
soundness and for compliance with Federal laws and regulations. Violations of Federal laws and regulations may affect
the safety and soundness of FCS institutions and could undermine public confidence in the FCS. System institutions
have the responsibility to establish and maintain safeguards to detect, deter, and report criminal activity involving
the assets, operations, or affairs of the institution. Law enforcement agencies need to receive timely and specific
information from FCS institutions on known or suspected criminal violations to determine whether investigations
and prosecutions are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interagency Bank Fraud Working Group (Working Group), a task force consisting of the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration, the Farm Credit Administration, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, was formed to facilitate the reporting of criminal activity by financial institutions and to enhance the
law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute the matters reported. To accomplish these objectives,
the Working Group developed uniform reporting standards and processes for filing criminal referrals and is in the
process of developing a uniform criminal referral form.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the proposed regulation and consistent with the Working Group's recommendations, FCS institutions
would be required to make a criminal referral and file a Referral Form when a criminal violation of the United States
Code involving the institution's assets, operations, or affairs appears to have occurred and one of the circumstances
listed in &sect;617.2(a) exists. However, the proposed regulation should not be construed as reducing in any way
an institution's responsibility to otherwise report criminal activities when these circumstances do not exist.
The referrals would be made to the appropriate investigatory and/or prosecuting authorities, whether Federal,
State, or local. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, the FCA proposed the use of a uniform criminal Referral Form which was designed by the Working Group. A
uniform criminal Referral Form was expected to aid law enforcement agencies in determining whether investigations
and/or prosecutions are warranted by standardizing requests for information and documentation. The FCA planned
to incorporate this form's standards and procedures in its own criminal Referral Form. When first published, the
proposed regulation indicated that the Referral Form, with instructions explaining how to complete, file, and distribute
the form to the appropriate investigatory agency, would be obtained from the FCA's Office of General Counsel (OGC)
or from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCA Examination Manual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Due to unforeseen circumstances affecting all the Federal financial regulatory agencies, the Working Group has
not yet promulgated a uniform criminal referral form. Consequently, the new Referral Form has not been developed.
As now contemplated under the proposed rule, System institutions would continue to use the existing criminal Referral
Forms found in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCA Examination Manual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, System institutions should expect the distribution of the new Referral Form after the Working Group completes
the standardized uniform criminal referral form.

III. Analysis of Changes and Comments by Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 617.1_Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council noted that the proposed regulations did not include a sample of the Referral Form and, as a result, it could
not determine whether System banks would maintain any role in the criminal referral process. As previously stated,
the FCA did not publish the Referral Form with the proposed regulation because the uniform criminal referral form,
which the FCA intends to incorporate, had not, and has not yet, been promulgated by the Working Group. The existing
Referral Form, which may be obtained from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCA Examination Manual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, does not create any substantive requirements, nor will the new Referral Form. The Referral Form merely serves as
a vehicle for ensuring that System institutions report the information necessary to make a criminal referral. The
new Referral Form is not expected to require System institutions to submit any more information than they previously
have been required to submit using the existing Referral Form. For these reasons, the FCA believes even if the new Referral
Form were available at this time, its publication would not be necessary. If the uniform criminal referral form ultimately
promulgated by the Working Group creates new and previously-unanticipated requirements, the FCA will reconsider
whether to incorporate it in its entirety into the System's Referral Form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council questioned whether or not the proposed regulation adequately addressed ``borrower transgressions.''
The FCA believes that the proposed regulation provides for the referral of all known or suspected violations of Federal
criminal laws, including both insider and borrower transgressions. In &sect;617.2(a) (2) and (3), the proposed
regulation specifically addresses borrower transgressions and would require a criminal referral when known or
suspected criminal activity occurs if certain circumstances are met. Section 617.2(a)(2) applies when the suspect
is not an employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the affairs of an institution, i.e.,
a borrower. Section 617.2(a)(3) applies when there is no substantial basis for identifying a suspect, which may include
a borrower. Therefore, no amendment is believed to be necessary. For instance, a referral would be required when known
or suspected criminal activity involving actual or potential losses of $1,000 or more occurs and the institution
has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects as a borrower(s). A referral would
also be required when known or suspected criminal activity involving actual or potential losses of $5,000 or more
occurs and the institution has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. In this
latter instance, the possible suspect or group of suspects could be a borrower(s). Also, &sect;617.2(a)(1) addresses
insider transgressions and would require a criminal referral, regardless of the amount of an actual or potential
loss, where an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the affairs of the
institution is suspected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council was concerned that the dollar thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities as described
in &sect;617.2(a)(2) and (3) were too low. It also stated that the respective $1,000 and $5,000 thresholds would result
in reporting known or suspected criminal activities that law enforcement agencies would not prosecute, and that
the thresholds were a radical departure from prior practice. The Council also commented that some district banks
have been advised by U.S. Attorneys that criminal activities involving collateral conversion or misrepresentation
of financial information are not prosecuted when the diversion or misrepresentation is less than $25,000 to $50,000
or if the institution does not incur an actual loss. As a result, the Council believes that the thresholds should be
increased to higher levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group, which included the FCA, established the same thresholds for all Federal financial regulatory
agencies. The Working Group believes that uniform thresholds will enhance the ability of the Federal financial regulatory
agencies and the law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute known or suspected criminal activities.
The Working Group also believes that the lower thresholds are necessary to ensure the reporting of potential multiple
criminal violations by one individual at several different institutions. The Department of Justice, as a member
of the Working Group and oversight agency for the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys, assisted in the establishment of the
thresholds. Therefore, as a participant in the Working Group and in concurrence with the Department of Justice's
judgment on this matter, the FCA continues to support the Working Group and proposes the regulation with these thresholds.
The FCA will reconsider this issue should the Working Group modify the threshold levels in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note, however, that only a known or suspected criminal violation (meeting the dollar threshold
requirements of &sect;617.2(a)) must be reported. Generally, a criminal violation that must be reported under this
part involves a determination that a borrower or insider intended to ``defraud'' an institution in violation of a
Federal criminal statute. Institutions, therefore, must make an initial determination of whether a misrepresentation
of assets or a collateral conversion, for example, was done inadvertently or with the intent to defraud the institution.
Accordingly, in ascertaining whether a criminal referral is appropriate, an institution should consider all facts
and circumstances, including evidence of intent, to determine whether there is a known or suspected criminal violation.
If the institution is persuaded that there is no evidence of intent and, hence, no criminal violation, then it need
not make a criminal referral. Thus, System institutions are vested with considerable discretion. Should they feel
the need for guidance in exercising this responsibility, they may consult legal counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to expressed concerns about the referral threshold, the FCA reviewed the Systemwide criminal referrals for calendar
years 1992 and 1993. In 1992, there were 47 criminal referrals, of which 30 reported no dollar loss or an unknown dollar
loss. In 1993, there were 53 criminal referrals of which 30 reported no dollar loss or an unknown dollar loss. In addition,
the FCA received 7 criminal referrals in 1992 and 17 criminal referrals in 1993 reporting dollar losses over $50,000.
Of the criminal referrals received, there was a total of four insider transgressions in 1992 and 1993. It appears from
these statistics that System institutions may already be reporting criminal referrals consistent with the proposed
thresholds and that the thresholds are not a radical departure from current practices. Accordingly, the FCA proposed
regulation contains the same thresholds as originally contemplated. Commenters who continue to have concerns that
the thresholds are too low are requested to provide empirical data indicating to what extent the thresholds would
result in a departure from their current reporting practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council remarked that the proposed regulation did not adequately define ``potential'' loss. In further explanation
of the proposed regulation, it should be noted that the regulation (and Federal law) does not require that an institution
sustain an actual loss; the potential for a loss satisfies the regulation (and Federal criminal law). Furthermore,
the proposed regulation specifically states that the loss or potential loss is to be determined before reimbursement
or recovery. In other words, whether or not the loan is adequately collateralized has no bearing on the determination
of whether there is a loss or potential loss. For example, if a borrower with a loan that appears to be adequately collateralized
converts $10,000 of secured property or makes a false statement by omitting a $10,000 liability from a financial statement,
the institution would be required to report this known or suspected criminal violation to the appropriate authorities.
This is necessary because the institution has a potential loss of $10,000 before it receives actual payment on the
loan or recovers on the secured property. Although the loan may appear to be adequately collateralized notwithstanding
the conversion of $10,000, the institution nonetheless has a potential loss before reimbursement or recovery. The
loss need not actually have occurred for a reportable violation to exist. The FCA believes the foregoing explanation
should adequately address the potential loss concept. It is further noted that, in attempting to clarify this section,
the language of &sect;617.2(a)(2) and (3) has been amended to clarify that a situation involving a potential loss
could arise through the use of a false statement or other fraudulent means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council further commented that the proposed regulation did not adequately address criminal acts that do not specifically
require a monetary loss, e.g., false statements under 18 U.S.C. 1014. As discussed above, such a criminal act has a
potential for monetary loss and should be reported in all situations where the threshold is met and it is reasonable
to believe that a criminal act occurred. The proposed regulation has been amended to clarify that a referral would
be required when there is a false statement that meets the threshold amounts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council expressed concern that the standard for reporting noninsider transgressions was vague and difficult
to apply. The Council noted that determining when a substantial basis exists for identifying a suspect can be complex
and raises questions as to whether criminal intent can be inferred. The Council suggested that this determination
should be vested in System general counsels or their attorney designees. The FCA expects that, in reporting noninsider
transgressions, an institution will often be able to use its own judgment in determining whether it appears that a
criminal violation has occurred. In complex cases, however, institutions should continue to feel free to obtain
advice, legal or otherwise, as necessary. A System association may always consult with its affiliated district bank
during consideration of all the facts and circumstances to determine whether it is more probable than not that a criminal
activity occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also commented that an institution should have discretion on whether to report known or suspected criminal
activities of State criminal laws to State law enforcement authorities. In response to this comment, the proposed
regulation was amended to provide that nothing in this part shall be construed as reducing, in any way, an institution's
general responsibility to report criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory and/or law enforcement
agencies, whether Federal, State or local. Therefore, institutions would have to be cognizant of, and take the necessary
steps to comply with, State reporting requirements. The appropriate law enforcement agency would then decide whether
or not such acts constitute a violation of a criminal statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council was concerned that the proposed regulation did not identify whether a Farm Credit Bank (FCB) or a Federal
land bank association (FLBA) would report known or suspected criminal activities when the FLBA services the loans
of the FCB. Due to this concern, the FCA amended &sect;617.2(a) to clarify that an FCB would have the responsibility
to refer known or suspected criminal activities identified by the servicing FLBA to the appropriate law enforcement
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council commented that the proposed criminal referral regulation appears to make the criminal referral process
burdensome because the institution lacks the discretion not to refer known or suspected criminal violations above
the threshold amounts. At this time, it appears that any additional burden would be slight and offset by the regulation's
benefits, such as the promotion of efficiency and timeliness in reporting, investigating, and prosecuting known
or suspected criminal activities. Also, the regulation would standardize the reporting process and ensure that
all individuals, including borrowers, employees, officers and directors, are treated equally. It is believed that
the proposed regulation, which conforms to those proposed and final regulations of other financial regulatory agencies,
would improve the law enforcement agencies' response to System institutions' reports of criminal activities. However,
commenters may want to provide empirical information on the cost of compliance, as requested above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council questioned the institution's role or ability to make a recommendation concerning prosecution. The Council
suggested that reporting ``minor'' violations could hamper System relationships with the U.S. Attorney as well
as with its customers. While the regulation establishes threshold referral levels, an institution is free, nonetheless,
to express its view on whether prosecution does or does not appear to be warranted to the Federal authorities, including
a U.S. Attorney or other investigatory agency. A well-reasoned recommendation against prosecution in appropriate
cases should go far toward addressing the Council's concern without undermining the uniformity that the referral
requirements seek to promote. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council commented that the 14-day period to report criminal activity was insufficient to investigate, document,
review, and submit referral information. On further reflection, the FCA agrees. To ensure thorough documentation
and reporting by System institutions, the FCA has amended the proposed regulation, increasing the reporting period
to 30 calendar days from the date of discovery of the known or suspected criminal violation. Nonetheless, System institutions
would be encouraged to submit a criminal referral report as soon as possible following the discovery of a reportable
known or suspected criminal activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council commented that it was uncertain as to when the period for reporting a criminal referral begins. Upon further
consideration, the proposed regulation was amended to address this concern. The reporting period would begin when
management has discovered that there is a known or suspected criminal activity. In the alternative, the reporting
period would begin when management should have discovered that there was a known or suspected criminal activity.
This amendment is believed to be appropriate because management must ensure the institution's safety and soundness
and should be diligent in the exercise of their attendant duties, e.g., the timely identification and reporting of
known or suspected criminal activity, and in the adequate investigation and documentation of such criminal activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council commented that &sect;617.2(c) (now &sect;617.2(b)) should define ``management'' as senior management
of the institution or the institution's criminal conduct officer/coordinator. The proposed regulation would require
that management make the criminal referral. The board of directors of a System institution, which is responsible
for the safe and sound operations of that institution, should establish appropriate policies and internal controls
for management to comply with these regulations. However, the board would have the discretion to implement the regulation
in a manner suited to its institution and could require senior management or the criminal conduct officer/coordinator
to make the criminal referral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council suggested eliminating &sect;617.2(d), which requires prompt notification, by telephone or other expeditious
means, to the appropriate law enforcement agency of situations requiring immediate attention or of ongoing reportable
violations. In coordination with other Federal financial regulatory agencies, the FCA included this section to
provide for circumstances in which direct telephone or other expeditious communications with the appropriate law
enforcement agency would be necessary or appropriate, even though an institution would have begun the referral process
required by &sect;617.2(a). While a 30-day notification period may be adequate in many situations, immediate notification
would be considered essential when the safety and soundness of an institution may be threatened by potential fraud,
losses, or an ongoing criminal activity, when there is a likelihood a suspect will flee, or when key institution personnel
are involved. For the foregoing reasons, it does not appear that this section would impose any unnecessary burden
on System institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Section 617.3_Notification of Board of Directors and Bonding Company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council commented that the regulatory reporting requirement concerning criminal referrals should be left to
the discretion of each board of directors, rather than requiring a report to the board of directors by their next scheduled
meeting. The intent of this section is to keep the board of directors informed when a known or suspected crime has been
committed against the institution. In response to the Council's comment, this section has been amended to require
that the board of directors be notified promptly of the filing of any Referral Form by the institution's management.
Reporting ``promptly'' to the board of directors means reporting the criminal referral at a regularly scheduled
meeting, or earlier if the estimated loss is of such magnitude that it would have a significant impact on the safety
and soundness of the institution. Alternatively, reports involving insignificant losses may be summarized and
reported periodically at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board. Because violations of Federal criminal statutes
may affect the safety and soundness of FCS institutions and/or undermine public confidence in the FCS, a board of directors
should be promptly notified of all known or suspected criminal activities. Furthermore, boards of directors should
treat this information with the same degree of care and confidentiality as other similar types of information are
treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed regulation was amended to provide some discretion in the event a member of the board of
directors is the subject of a criminal referral. In this instance, it may be appropriate to seek guidance from legal
counsel or other appropriate sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This part applies to all institutions of the Farm Credit System as defined in section 1.2(a) of the Act (12 U.S.C.
2002(a)) including, but not limited to, associations, banks, service corporations chartered under section 4.25
of the Act, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation,
the Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter,
institutions). The purposes of this part are to ensure the reporting of known or suspected criminal activity, the
safety and soundness of the institution, and public confidence in the Farm Credit System, thereby reducing potential
losses to institutions. This part requires that institutions use the Farm Credit Administration Criminal Referral
Form to notify the appropriate Federal authorities when any known or suspected Federal criminal violations of the
type described in &sect;617.2 are discovered by an institution.

(b) The specific referral requirements of this part are limited to known or suspected criminal violations of the United
States Code involving the assets, operations, or affairs of an institution. This part prescribes procedures for
referring those violations to the proper Federal authorities and the Farm Credit Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Nothing in this part should be construed as reducing in any way an institution's responsibility to report known
or suspected criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory or prosecuting authorities, whether State or
Federal, even if circumstances required for a report under &sect;617.2 are not present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each referral required by &sect;617.2(a) shall be made on the Referral Form in accordance with the Referral Form
Instructions relating to its filing and distribution and the requirements of &sect;617.2 (b) and (c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each institution and its board of directors shall exercise due diligence to ensure the discovery, investigation,
and reporting of criminal activity. Within 30 calendar days of determining that there is a known or suspected criminal
activity, the institution shall refer such criminal violation of the United States Code involving or affecting its
assets, operations, or affairs to the appropriate regional offices of the United States Attorney and either or both
the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the United States Secret Service, using the Referral Form. In the event that
a Farm Credit Bank makes a loan through a Federal land bank association which services the loan, the Farm Credit Bank
has the responsibility to refer known or suspected criminal violations under this section. A report is required in
circumstances where there is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any known or suspected criminal activity (e.g., theft, embezzlement), mysterious disappearance, unexplained
shortage, misapplication, or other defalcation of property and/or funds, regardless of amount, where an institution
employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution
is suspected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss (before reimbursement or recovery)
of $1,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has a substantial basis
for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects and the suspect(s) is not an employee, officer, director,
agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss (before reimbursement or recovery)
of $5,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has no substantial basis
for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving a financial transaction in which the institution was used
as a conduit for such criminal activity (such as money laundering/structuring schemes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A copy of the completed Referral Form, accompanied by any relevant documentation, shall be provided to the Farm
Credit Administration's Office of General Counsel no later than 30 calendar days after the institution's management,
has discovered (or should have discovered) a known or suspected criminal violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In circumstances where there is also a known or suspected violation of State or local criminal law, the institution
shall also notify the appropriate State law enforcement authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the institution shall immediately notify by
telephone the offices specified on the Referral Form upon discovery of cases involving known or suspected criminal
violations requiring urgent attention or where a referable violation is ongoing. Such cases include, but are not
limited to, those where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There is a likelihood that the suspect(s) will flee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The magnitude or the continuation of the known or suspected criminal violation may imperil the institution's
continued operation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Key institution personnel are involved.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard is considering a proposal to establish a special local regulation for the Marine Event, Thunder on
the Water. This event will be held on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel, Tonawanda, NY from 10 a.m. (EDST) until
6 p.m. (EDST) on August 27, 1994 and from 11 a.m. (EDST) until 6 p.m. and August 28, 1994. This event will have an estimated
70 inboard hydroplanes and runabouts, racing a closed course race on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel which could
pose hazards to navigation in the area. A special local regulation which would restrict vessel traffic in the area
is necessary to ensure the safety of life, limb and property on portions of the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel during
this event.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interested persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, data or arguments.
Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice (CGD 09&hyph;94&hyph;10)
and the specific section of the proposal to which their comments apply, and give reasons for each comment. Receipt
of comments will be acknowledged if a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope is enclosed. The rules may be changed
in light of comments received. All comments received before the expiration of the comment period will be considered
before final action is taken on this proposal. A 45 day comment period is used instead of the preferred 60 day period
to unable the Coast Guard to publish a Final Rule within 30 days of the event date. It has been determined that a 45 day
comment period is sufficient to allow interested persons to submit comments on this event. No public hearing is planned,
but one may be held if written requests for a hearing are received and it is determined that the opportunity to make oral
presentations will aid the rulemaking process.

Discussion of proposed regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Thunder on the Water will be conducted on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel, between the South Grand Island
Bridge and Tonawanda Island, on August 27, and 28, 1994. This event will have an estimated 70 inboard hydroplanes and
runabouts racing in a closed race course, oval in shape, approximately 0.5 nautical miles long, 0.25 nautical miles
wide, running northeast/southwest in the Tonawanda Channel which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. In
order to provide for the safety of life, limb and property, the Coast Guard is considering a proposal to regulate vessel
traffic within this section of the Niagara River, Tonawada Channel. Commercial vessels desiring to transit the regulated
area shall provide prior notification to the Coast Guard Patrol Commander. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated
area may do so only with prior approval of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station
Buffalo, NY).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 100.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and
it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposed regulation and concluded that, under section
2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental
documentation.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the
regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve Indiana's 1990 base year ozone precursor
inventories for certain ozone nonattainment areas as a revision to the Indiana ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP).
The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing
ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with USEPA guidance.
The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking are Evansville (Vanderburgh
County); Indianapolis (Marion County); Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart (Elkhart
and St. Joseph Counties). In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views
this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed
rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this
notice should do so at this time.

I. February 11, 1993 Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widespread
hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection
and proper management (58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure, known as a special collection system,
is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner that is protective of human
health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators of these wastes. Proposed regulatory
language was included for hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or cancelled hazardous waste pesticides
that are recalled. Several other wastes, including hazardous waste thermostats, were also discussed briefly in
the preamble as possible additions to the special collection system. The Agency also included a proposed petition
process to be used to add additional wastes to the special collection system in the future, and criteria to identify
wastes that would be appropriate for addition. See 58 FR 8102, February 11, 1993 for a detailed discussion of the proposal.

II. Description of Available Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 11, 1993 ``universal wastes'' proposal (58 FR 8126) the Agency committed to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Analyze the costs of the current regulatory requirements for generators and collection facilities and
of the requirements [proposed]''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Analyze whether there are significant reduced environmental benefits from the modifications being proposed'';
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Notice the analysis for comment prior to promulgating a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The document made available for comment by this notice, ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for
Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994, presents these analyses.
Part I of the document summarizes the proposed universal wastes regulations and introduces the analyses. Part II
discusses and compares estimated costs of the existing Subtitle C regulations and of the proposed changes to these
regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed regulations will result in total annual savings
of approximately 93 million dollars. A sensitivity analysis is also included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III of the document discusses whether the proposed regulatory changes will significantly reduce the environmental
benefits provided by the current Subtitle C regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed reduced
regulations will not significantly diminish the environmental protection currently provided by the full Subtitle
C regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is requesting comment on the methodology used and the results of both the cost analysis and the analysis
of potential significantly reduced environmental benefits.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend our regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require States to provide, as a condition of Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility, for mandatory enrollment of certain Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibles in employer-based group health plans determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-effective by States under guidelines approved by HCFA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and require States to pay all premiums, and all deductibles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plans for items and services otherwise covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the approved Medicaid State plans. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would provide for Medicaid payment of premiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for certain individuals who are entitled to elect COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage (see Public Law 99&hyph;272 and section 601 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a group health plan provided by an employer with 75 or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Medicaid is the Federally assisted State program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act) to provide medical care to persons of limited means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among these persons are those individuals who receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance under title IV&hyph;A (Aid to Families of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dependent Children (AFDC)), and title XVI (Supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Income (SSI)) and mandatory State supplements (SSP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the territories title XVI (Old-Age Assistance (OAA), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aid to the Blind (AB), Aid to the Permanently and Totally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disabled (APTD), Aid to the Aged, Blind or Disabled (AABD)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State determines the scope of its program, within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations and guidelines established by the law and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 430 et seq. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State submits a State plan that, when approved by HCFA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the basis for granting Federal funds to cover part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the expenditures incurred by the State for medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance and the administration of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a) of the Act specifies the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that individuals must meet in order to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid. Other sections of the Act describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups in detail and specify limitations on what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be paid for as ``medical assistance.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1905(a) of the Act, States may pay health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance premiums on behalf of eligible recipients. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such cases, the insurer is liable to pay for benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered under its plan but Medicaid continues to pay for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services covered under the Medicaid plan (but not covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the insurer's plan). In addition, State payment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health insurance premium must not have the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting a recipient's rights under Medicaid (for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
freedom of choice among providers). Section 4402(a)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted on November 5, 1990, added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1906 to title XIX of the Act to require States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide, as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory enrollment of certain Medicaid eligibles in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer-based group health plans determined to be cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective under guidelines established by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision applies to the 50 States and the District of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia and includes any State providing Medicaid to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients under an experimental, pilot, or demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project under the waiver authority of section 1115 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A group health plan is defined under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906(e)(1) as having the same meaning given the term in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the provision of COBRA continuation coverage by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a plan under title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VI of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ERISA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adding section 1906 to the Act, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4402 of OBRA '90 made the following conforming amendments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Added a new section 1902(a)(25)(G) to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State plans must meet the new requirements of section 1906 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for enrollment of individuals under group health plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Section 4402(a)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Added a new section 1902(e)(11)(A) to allow States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue Medicaid payments of premiums, deductibles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations on behalf of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Medicaid recipient required to enroll in a group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan for a State-defined period of up to 6 months after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the recipient's enrollment, even if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollee ceases to be eligible for Medicaid during that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, but only for services covered under the group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Added a new subparagraph (XI) in the matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following section 1902(a)(10)(F) to allow Medicaid coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the cost of premiums, deductibles, coinsurances, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other cost-sharing obligations for individuals in cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plans without requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of comparable services of the same amount, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration and scope to any other individuals (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4402(d)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised section 1903(u)(1)(D)(iv) to specify that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of Federal financial participation (FFP), HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include any error with respect to Medicaid payments made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in violation of section 1906 of the Act (Section 4402(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised section 1905(a) by adding language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that ``medical assistance'' may include expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicare cost-sharing and premiums under Part B for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who are eligible for medical assistance and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFDC, SSI, OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD recipients or SSP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries and are eligible for medical assistance made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to individuals described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A); and, except in the case of individuals 65 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years of age or older and disabled individuals entitled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare who are not enrolled under Medicare Part B, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance premiums for medical or any other type of remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care or cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised section 1903(a)(1) to delete the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Medicaid expenditures for Medicare cost-sharing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums under Part B. This language was added to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1905 of the Act in the definition of medical assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4402 of OBRA '90 has also undermined the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser v. Sullivan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 906 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the United States Court of Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of ``medical assistance'' under section 1905(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act did not include the payment of medical insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums. We note that the Ninth Circuit issued its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision on June 25, 1990. However, section 4402 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of OBRA '90 subsequently amended section 1905(a) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include the payment of medical insurance premiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressly within the definition of ``medical assistance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we regard section 4402 of OBRA '90 as superseding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation, which effectively nullifies any legal effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Identification of Cost-Effective Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1906(a)(1) requires States to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines that are established by the Secretary to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases in which enrollment of a Medicaid eligible individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a group health plan (in which the individual is otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible to be enrolled) is cost-effective. In section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906(e)(2) of the Act, the term ``cost-effective'' means the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of paying the premiums and cost-sharing obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a group health plan is likely to be less than the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of providing services covered under the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine cost-effectiveness, we would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to use the cost-effectiveness methodology included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their approved State plan. States are required to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the methodology described in &sect;3910.11 of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid Manual (HCFA Pub. 45&hyph;3), or an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology that could be supported by documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished by a State. The State's alternative methodology, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a minimum, must include factors accounting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee's premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must compare these factors to the State's average Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for an equivalent set of services for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual with similar characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with the section 1906 requirement that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary establish cost-effectiveness guidelines, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restating the information contained in the State Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manual as an example of an acceptable methodology that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must include in its State plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our guidelines consist of the following steps:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1_Policy Information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency obtains information on all group health plans available to the Medicaid recipient. The Medicaid recipient
is responsible for providing the State with all the necessary plan information and reporting changes with respect
to plan benefits. This information must include the effective date of the policy, any exclusions to enrollment, the
services covered under the policy, the employee's share of premiums paid to the health plan and other costs that may
be necessary for enrollment in the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2_Average Medicaid Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), the agency obtains the average total annual Medicaid costs
of persons having characteristics similar to the applicant (age, sex, categorical group and geographic data).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3_Medicaid Costs for Included Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency determines the amount of the total yearly Medicaid expenditures for services covered by the specific group
health policy. Compute the percentage of expenditures for group health plan services to expenditures for Medicaid
services. Then adjust the average total annual Medicaid costs specified in step 2 by this percentage. This is the ``Medicaid
average covered expense amount.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4_Group Health Plan Costs for Included Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency adjusts the Medicaid average covered expense amount (amount calculated in step 3) for the higher prices
employer plans typically pay. The agency may use a single State-specific factor derived from experience with third
party liability (TPL) claims or use group health plan specific information. Alternatively, the agency may use a national
average factor which HCFA supplies and updates periodically. The Medicaid covered expense is multiplied by this
factor to produce an estimated covered expense as recognized by the employer health plan. This is the ``health plan
cost.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5_Adjustment for Coinsurance and Deductible Amounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The health plan cost (amount from step 4) is multiplied by an average employer health insurance payment rate to obtain
the ``employer recognized covered expense'' amount. The agency derives the average employer health insurance payment
rate from State specific tables, if available, or group health plan specific information. Alternatively, for State
agency use, HCFA supplies and periodically updates national tables. This health insurance average payment rate
number will vary in relation to the amount of the average employer recognized covered expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 6_Administrative Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency accounts for any additional Medicaid administrative costs incurred in processing the group health information
by determining the average increase in cost per recipient. These costs may include all up-front administrative costs
associated with the implementation of this provision. These costs must be amortized over a 5-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 7_Cost-Effectiveness Calculation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the costs under the group health plan to those costs under Medicaid. This comparison is as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Group Health Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Subtract the employer recognized covered expense (step 5) from the health plan cost (step 4) (the figure obtained
is the proxy for deductibles, coinsurance and limitations within group health plans);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the employee's share of premiums paid (step 1); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the additional administrative costs (step 6) (the figure obtained is the total State costs under the group
health plan).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

offered under the group health plan are:

Adjust the Medicaid average covered expense amount (amount from step 3) for the higher prices employer plans typically
pay. Use either a single State specific factor derived from experience with TPL, group health plan specific information,
or a national factor supplied by HCFA. For the purpose of this example, 1.3 was used as a factor. The Medicaid covered
expense is multiplied by this factor to produce an estimated covered expense as recognized by the employer plan.

The health plan cost (amount from step 4) is multiplied by

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1906(a)(2) of the Act, an otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligible individual who is also eligible to enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an employer-based group health plan, which the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines under the Secretary's guidelines to be cost-effective, must enroll in the group health plan as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of his or her continued eligibility for Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We interpret this requirement to mean that if a Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient is currently enrolled in a non-employer-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan and is also eligible to enroll in a cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective employer-based group health plan, the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must enroll in the cost-effective group health plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain his or her Medicaid eligibility. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued enrollment in the non-employer-based plan is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory. This requirement must be met at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of initial eligibility or, for current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipients, at the time of an eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redetermination with certain exceptions as provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute. If more than one cost-effective group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is identified by the State, the individual has the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolling in the cost-effective plan of his or her choice.

Under section 1906(b)(1) of the Act, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(and, consequently, States) must take into account that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual may only be eligible to enroll in group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans at limited times (open season) and only if other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals (not necessarily eligible for nor entitled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical assistance under the State plan) are also enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the group health plan simultaneously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the availability for enrollment in the group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan and eligibility to Medicaid benefits do not coincide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State should have a procedure in place for recontacting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals prior to the next enrollment period. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipient will be entitled to receive Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services pending that recipient's application to enroll in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the group health plan during the next open season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although enrollment in a cost-effective group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan is a condition of Medicaid eligibility, an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disenrollment from a group health plan is permissible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these circumstances: (1) The State reevaluates the cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the group health plan during the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redetermination of the individual's eligibility, (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plan is no longer available, for example, due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the individual leaving employment or changing jobs, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the individual was enrolled through a spouse who is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer willing to enroll the individual.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1906(a)(2) requires every individual entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive Medicaid to apply for enrollment in a cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plan as a condition of initial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued eligibility for Medicaid. However, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906(b)(2), enrollment in the group health plan is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of initial or continued Medicaid eligibility for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child if a parent fails to enroll that child. We also note 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that where a Medicaid eligible spouse (for example, a wife) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot apply for enrollment in her husband's group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan if her husband fails to enroll her, she will not lose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid by virtue of his failure to enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her. This is because the section 1906(a)(2) requirements do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to a Medicaid eligible spouse who does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the independent ability to apply for enrollment in a cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Services Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1906(c)(2) of the Act, an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment in a group health plan does not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's eligibility for benefits under the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, under section 1902(a)(25), Medicaid is a payer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last resort with respect to services covered under the group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan. In other words, the group health plan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is considered primary to any Medicaid payments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must pay for services covered under the State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are not otherwise included in the group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the terms and conditions applicable to all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipients. States must establish their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to pay for Medicaid services that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included under the group health plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that some providers that participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plans may not be Medicaid-participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers. Of course, States should always encourage all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to participate in Medicaid. However, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest of State flexibility, we are offering several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options that States may elect to resolve problems that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arise from non-Medicaid-participating providers furnishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services to Medicaid recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, States that deem providers to be Medicaid-participating providers merely through the submission of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bill for services to the State Medicaid agency (as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently permitted for qualified Medicare beneficiaries) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may similarly do so for providers in cost-effective group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plans. In lieu of this voluntary provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement, States could require that all providers in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-effective group health plan bill States directly for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual charges on services provided to Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients. In other words, States may deem all providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cost-effective group health plans to be Medicaid- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating providers by billing the State directly for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any care or services provided under the group health plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are otherwise covered under the State Medicaid plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but which are not fully paid by the group health plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, States may ascertain what percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers in a group health plan participate in Medicaid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and incorporate that percentage into the determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a group health plan is cost-effective. If the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that fewer than a certain percentage (specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State) of all providers in a group health plan are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not Medicaid-participating providers, the group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be cost-effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If either of these options is not feasible for a State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we will allow a State to reimburse recipients directly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event a recipient is billed directly for any care or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services provided under the group health plan, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise covered under the State Medicaid plan, but which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not fully paid by the group health plan. We will allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to pay recipients directly where a State demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that failure to do so would render section 1906 of the Act a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nullity. A situation in which the provisions of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906 could not be effectuated but for direct payment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients presents extraordinary circumstances sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to justify direct payment to recipients. Under any of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios, a State would have to pay for all cost-sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations, even if such costs are above the State's usual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid rate for services provided to Medicaid recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the State agency must pay for an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollee's premiums for a group health plan determined cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective, and for all deductibles, coinsurance, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items and services otherwise covered under the State plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 1906(a)(3). Further, when a non-Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible family member must first be enrolled in a group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan in order for the Medicaid eligible member to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive coverage, section 1906(c)(1)(B) provides that where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is determined to be cost-effective (taking into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of all such additional premiums), Medicaid payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available for the premiums (but no other forms of cost-sharing) of the non-Medicaid eligible member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Payment Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the State must treat payment for services covered under the group health plan as a third party liability
under section 1902(a)(25) of the Act. Where Medicaid must participate in cost-sharing for deductibles and coinsurance,
the State is required to reimburse all cost-sharing at the employer-based group health plan payment rate. The State
is not required to pay for the nominal cost-sharing amounts otherwise permitted under section 1916 of the Act which
are the recipient's responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(e)(11) of the Act provides States with the option to continue payments to the group health plan on behalf
of a Medicaid recipient after the recipient ceases to be eligible for Medicaid for a maximum period of 6 months from
the effective date of the recipient's required enrollment in the group health plan under section 1906(a). A State
electing this option must include this provision in its State plan, and should specify the length of the applicable
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Federal Financial Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1906(c)(1) specifies that, for purposes of section 1903(a) of the Act, FFP is available as ``medical assistance''
for all premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan for services
covered under the State plan. However, if the State imposes nominal cost sharing under section 1916 of the Act, payment
of such amounts are the recipient's responsibility and are not paid for under section 1906. Therefore, FFP is not available
for the nominal cost-sharing amounts otherwise permitted under section 1916 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a non-Medicaid eligible family member must be enrolled in the group health plan in order to obtain coverage for the
Medicaid eligible, FFP is available for premiums only (but not for any other cost-sharing expenses) for the non-Medicaid
eligible family member(s) as payment for medical assistance for the eligible individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a Medicaid recipient's group health plan offers a wider array of services than those services covered under the
State plan, no FFP is available for the deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations for non-covered
services. For States that elect to cover individuals during the optional period allowed under section 1902(e)(11),
FFP would be restricted to the individual's premiums and appropriate deductibles and coinsurance for services provided
to the individual under the group health plan, and would not be available for payment for any other items and services
covered by the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a Medicaid recipient is currently enrolled in a non-employer-based health plan and is also eligible to enroll in
a cost-effective group health plan, the recipient must enroll in the cost-effective group health plan to maintain
his or her Medicaid eligibility. If enrollment in both health plans remains cost-effective, FFP is available for
the premiums of the non-employer-based plans specified in section 1905(a) of the Act. However, continued enrollment
in the non-employer-based plan is not mandatory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Many cost-effective prepaid type group health plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for example, health maintenance organizations (HMOs)), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose strict requirements on care and services that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursed under the plan. These requirements may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of certain providers exclusively and/or prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization for the need for care or services. If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollee receives services which are not in compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan requirements, and the group health plan consequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuses reimbursement for services usually covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan, under section 1902(a)(17)(B) of the Act, FFP would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be permitted for any service that is generally available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recipient without cost.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our rules concerning determination and redetermination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of eligibility for the 50 States and the District of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia are found in 42 CFR part 435, subpart J. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules are not affected by this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Changes in the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to amend part 435 (Eligibility in States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
America Samoa) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Eligibility Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;We would revise &sect;435.3, Basis, to add new bases for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 435 resulting from amendments to title XIX of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by section 4402 of OBRA '90. Section 1902(e)(11) concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 6-month maximum optional enrollment period in a cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plan. Section 1903(u)(1) concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of erroneous payments made in violation of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906 of the Act. Section 1905(a) concerns expenditures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare cost-sharing and premiums under Part B. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906 concerns the requirement that Medicaid eligibles enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in group health plans determined to be cost-effective under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines established by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 435.10, State plan requirements, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised to specify that State plans must require that, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of eligibility, individuals must enroll in group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plans where the State agency determines it is cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective to pay for that individual's premiums, deductibles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other cost-sharing obligations, using guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the Secretary. The plan also must comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements in a new &sect;435.186, Medicaid payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for recipients enrolled in cost-effective group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans. In that new section, we would require that the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay for all premiums, and deductibles, coinsurance and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations (other than nominal copayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted under section 1916 of the Act) for Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients for items and services covered under the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. We would require the State to pay premiums only for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-Medicaid recipient when that person must enroll in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plan in order for the Medicaid eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to be enrolled, and only when the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines it to be cost-effective to do so. We would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the State to treat the group health plan as a third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party resource in accordance with third party liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specified in &sect;433.138, except that FFP would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available in expenditures for services provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients who were eligible in the month in which services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were provided as provided under &sect;435.1002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A new &sect;435.611, Limitation of payment for special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups of individuals, would be added to specify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions and conditions of eligibility (of individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise eligible for Medicaid), for enrollment and payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing obligations for items and service in a group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan.

(b) Federal Financial Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 435.1002 would be revised to provide for FFP in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for payment of premiums, deductibles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations on behalf of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a recipient enrolled in a cost-effective group health plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behalf of individuals who are no longer eligible but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed eligible under the 6-month enrollment option and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums for individuals who must be enrolled.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985 (COBRA '85), Public Law 99&hyph;272, requires an employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 20 or more employees that offers a group health plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer employees the opportunity to elect continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under that plan after certain qualifying events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(explained more fully below), that ordinarily result in loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such coverage. This provision is popularly known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COBRA continuation coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4713 of OBRA '90 amended title XIX of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Security Act by adding a new section 1902(a)(10)(F) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a new section 1902(u) to specify an additional group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who may be eligible for a limited Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit payment of COBRA premiums for insurance coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions allow a State Medicaid agency the option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the group health insurance premiums for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage. However, this provision, unlike the 20-employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in COBRA '85, only applies to group health plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by employers with 75 or more employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a)(10)(F), as added by section 4713 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '90, provides States with the option of making medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance available for COBRA premiums, as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1902(u)(2), for qualified COBRA continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries (CCBs), as defined in section 1902(u)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. Section 1902(u)(1) defines a CCB as an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who meets the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;He or she is entitled to elect COBRA continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;He or she has income that does not exceed 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the official Federal poverty line applicable to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family of the size involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;He or she has resources which do not exceed twice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income (SSI) program, as determined under section 1613 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Social Security Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State has determined that the likely savings in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid expenditures resulting from enrollment in COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage is expected to exceed the cost of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COBRA premiums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the cost-effectiveness determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for CCBs, States must determine that likely Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures on individuals would be higher (if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals were not enrolled in the COBRA plan) than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost the State would pay in COBRA continuation premiums. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other words, the State must determine that enrolling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals in COBRA continuation coverage results in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings in likely Medicaid expenditures that exceed the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paying the COBRA premiums. This requires the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a reasonable decision that the individuals (or family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members that would be covered by the COBRA coverage) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to become eligible for Medicaid during the COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation period and that enrollment is expected to save 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money for the Medicaid program. This decision would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an assessment of whether the individuals would be likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become Medicaid eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contemplating scenarios under which this cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness could be satisfied, we have identified a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of situations in which individuals would appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``likely'' ultimately to generate Medicaid expenditures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of COBRA continuation coverage, even if they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not currently Medicaid eligible. This would be true, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, of a COBRA-eligible individual who is HIV positive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accordingly is determined ``likely'' to become Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible based upon disability, and to incur Medicaid costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that exceed the cost of COBRA premiums. A COBRA eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who is not eligible for Medicaid may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid-eligible family members who would be covered by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COBRA continuation plan if COBRA premiums were paid by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. In this case, savings in Medicaid expenditures would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be likely to result from the individual's enrollment even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though he or she is not Medicaid eligible, nor expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become Medicaid eligible. Finally, a COBRA-eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual may be eligible for Medicaid as ``medically needy'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the satisfaction of some modest ``spend-down'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. In such a case, it may well be reasonable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State to conclude that ``likely'' Medicaid expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would exceed the cost of paying COBRA continuation premiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would have the effect of precluding the individual from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurring expenses sufficient to make him or her Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(u)(2) defines the term ``COBRA premiums'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable premium imposed with respect to COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage. Section 1902(u)(3) defines COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage as coverage under a group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by an employer with 75 or more employees provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clause (XI) in the matter following section 1902(a)(10)(F), as amended by section 4713(a)(1)(D) of OBRA '90, requires
that medical assistance available to an individual defined in section 1902(u)(1) who is eligible for medical assistance
only because of section 1902(a)(10)(F) be limited to medical assistance for COBRA continuation premiums (as defined
in section 1902(u)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1905(a)(x), as added by section 4713(b) of OBRA '90 amends the definition of medical assistance to include
the new group of individuals described in section 1902(u)(1) who may be eligible for Medicaid through payment of premiums
for COBRA continuation insurance coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(u)(4) specifies that, for individuals who may qualify for Medicaid payment for COBRA continuation
coverage and who are receiving an optional State supplementary payment, the State must apply an income standard (as
determined under section 1612 of the Act) of no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty level applicable to a family
of the size involved. In determining income, except for costs described under section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act
for certain functionally disabled individuals, the State must exclude costs incurred for medical care and for any
other type of remedial care under this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because individuals identified in section 1902(u)(4) are by definition already eligible for Medicaid, we are unaware
of the relevance of this provision to individuals eligible under section 1902(a)(10)(F). Moreover, we are unaware
of anything in the legislative history of section 4713 which indicates what Congress intended to accomplish by this
provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Eligibility Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In interpreting the provisions of section 1902(u)(1), we propose to require that a CCB must also meet the existing
general non-financial requirements or conditions of eligibility for medical assistance contained in our regulations
in 42 CFR part 435. These general requirements include, for example, the filing of an application for Medicaid (&sect;435.907),
furnishing a social security number (&sect;435.910), providing citizenship and residency information (&sect;&sect;435.406
and 435.408), and assigning rights to third party payments to the State Medicaid agency (&sect;435.604). However,
these individuals do not have to meet the categorical requirements of either the SSI or AFDC programs. An individual
who is otherwise eligible for Medicaid under the State plan may also be eligible as a CCB. An individual who is eligible
for Medicaid as a CCB as well as under some other Medicaid eligibility group may choose, as specified in &sect;435.404,
to have eligibility determined only under one category. However, the individual is not required to make such a choice.
The individual is entitled to have eligibility determined under all categories for which he or she may qualify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an individual does not specifically and voluntarily choose to have his or her eligibility determined under a specific
category, and if he or she is eligible both as a CCB and under another group in the State plan, the individual is designated
as being eligible both as a CCB and the other group for which he or she is eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Determination of Financial Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the income and resource eligibility for CCBs under section 1902(u)(1)(B) and (C), we would require
the State to use the income and resources methodologies of the SSI program under sections 1612 and 1613 of the Act, respectively.
By methodologies, we mean the methods for determining the individual's countable income and resources, that is,
the amounts that may be considered to be available to the individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Determination and Redetermination of Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules for timely determination of eligibility and periodic redetermination of eligibility set forth in existing
&sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.916 would apply to determinations and redeterminations of CCB eligibility. Specifically,
&sect;435.911 requires the State to establish time standards for determining eligibility, and inform the applicant
of what they are. Section 435.916 requires the State agency to redetermine Medicaid eligibility, with respect to
circumstances that may change, at least every 12 months or when it has knowledge of changes that may affect eligibility,
and requires States to have procedures for recipients to report changes that may affect their eligibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual's effective date for Medicaid payment of COBRA premiums under sections 1902(a)(10)(F) and 1902(u)
can be no earlier than January 1, 1991, the effective date of section 4713 of OBRA '90. The individual's effective date
of eligibility date is based on the date of application and the date on which all eligibility criteria, including election
of COBRA continuation coverage, are met. CCBs are subject to the existing policy of up to 3 months retroactive eligibility
as specified in &sect;435.914.

7. Changes in the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to amend part 435 (Eligibility in States, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American
Samoa) and part 436 (Eligibility in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) as follows: Eligibility Requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 435.10 and 436.10 would be revised and new &sect;&sect;435.240 and 436.274 would be added to specify criteria
for determining COBRA continuation coverage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We would also make conforming changes to &sect;&sect;435.2, 435.3, 435.400, 435.600, 436.2, 436.400 and 436.600.

III. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on substantial number of small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition
of small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a Metropolitan Statistical area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these regulations do not themselves have a significant impact on the general economy, the statutory provisions
on which they are based are expected to have an impact. In particular, we have determined that the part of the regulation
dealing with section 4402 of OBRA '90 has the following savings impact for the Medicaid program:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
We used the following methodology to estimate these savings. We used data from the Current Population Survey (CPS)
and the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) to estimate the fraction of Medicaid recipients having access
to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) but not currently enrolled in it: about 3 percent for children and 1/2 percent
for adults (including the disabled). We assumed that about 75 percent of these individuals would be subject to the
group health enrollment requirements. In addition, we assumed that ESI premiums rates are based on utilization which
is 80 to 90 percent of that of Medicaid enrollees for adults and children and 30 to 40 percent of these premiums on average.
Employee cost-sharing was estimated at 20 percent, and the ratio of Medicaid to employer plan recognized charges
was assumed to be about two-thirds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, we do not have the data to estimate the impact of section 4713 of OBRA '90 regarding optional Medicaid payment
of group health plan premiums for COBRA continuation beneficiaries. Although this legislation creates a new eligibility
group, we do not believe a significant number of individuals would become eligible. Further, this provision is optional
for the States. To the extent these individuals become eligible for Medicaid, we believe this provision would reduce
expected future Medicaid costs through continued coverage by employer group health plans in lieu of Medicaid coverage
for a period of up to 29 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
We have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Sections 435.10 and 436.10 of these proposed rules contain information collection requirements that are subject
to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). We estimate that any State plan amendments required by these provisions will take a total of not
more than 50 hours total. A notice will be published in the Federal Register

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We have reprinted in the following proposed regulations text certain provisions included in a final rule with comment
period that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
on January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4908). The January 19, 1993 rule made numerous changes to the organization and numbering
of the Medicaid regulations. Therefore, we have reprinted the provisions in order to set forth appropriate text for
the provisions of this proposed rule. The effective dates for the January 19 final rule have been delayed (58 FR 9120,
February 19, 1993; 58 FR 44457, August 23, 1993; and 59 FR 8138, February 18, 1994). If at the time we issue the final rule
for these proposed regulations, the reprinted text has been revised or is not in effect, we will make appropriate changes
to ensure that the existing CFR text is reflected.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basic requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify cases in which enrollment of a Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient in an employer-based group health plan is cost-effective and require, as a condition of eligibility, that
individuals (or in the case of a child, the child's parent) apply for enrollment in such plans, except as provided in
paragraph (c) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Specify a methodology for determining the cost-effectiveness of an individual's enrollment in a group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan that is acceptable to HCFA. The agency may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Use the methodology established by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Use an alternative methodology, which, at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum, must include factors accounting for the employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and other cost-sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations under the group health plan. It also must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compare these factors to the State's average Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for an equivalent set of services for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual in similar circumstances, and may include factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not specified in this paragraph, for example, considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients' diagnosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include in its Medicaid plan provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of all enrollee premiums necessary for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, and all deductibles, coinsurance, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations for services under the State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicaid recipients enrolled in an employer-based group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan that has been determined by the State to be cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provide for payment for premiums for non-Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible family members only if the cost-effective employer-based group health plan requires enrollment of a non-Medicaid
eligible family member as a condition for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligible family member to enroll in the group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Treat the group health plan as a third party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource in accordance with third party liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements as specified in &sect;435.138, except FFP is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available as provided in &sect;435.1002; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Specify that the Medicaid recipient will receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid services pending the submission of the group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan application during the group health plan's next open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parent of that child fails to enroll the child in a group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to amend its vessel documentation regulations. The proposed amendments would clarify the
vessel documentation regulations by restating the citizenship requirements for trusts to reflect the Coast Guard's
policy; by correcting an existing cross-reference error regarding mortgagee consent for exchange of Certificates
of Documentation; by implementing statutory requirements concerning the endorsements on Certificates of Documentation
for dredges and towing vessels; and by making other minor technical amendments.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60256) which revised 46 CFR Part 67 to implement a number of statutory initiatives to simplify and streamline
the documentation process, to implement user fees for vessel documentation services, and to clarify the regulations
and present them in a more orderly fashion. The final rule was the subject to two correction documents which appeared
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 13, 1993, at 58 FR 65130 and 58 FR 65243. The final rule became effective on January 1, 1994. This rulemaking,
among other things, corrects certain errors and omissions in the final rule. It also clarifies the citizenship requirements
for a trust arrangement as a vessel-owning entity, and states the endorsements required for dredges and towing vessels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1998 Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;316 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;329) to require towing vessels to be documented
with a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement, as appropriate. On November 4, 1992, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app.
&sect;292 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;587) to require vessels of at least five net tons engaged in dredging in the navigable
waters of the United States to be documented with a coastwise endorsement. Neither of these statutory requirements
were included in the revision of Part 67. In order to state those requirements and to clarify the endorsement requirements
for vessels employed in towing or dredging, the regulations need to be amended. This rulemaking proposes that amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to revise paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;67.19, which respectively describe a coastwide
and Great Lakes endorsement, by adding the words ``, dredging, towing,'' in paragraph (a), and adding the words ``,
towing in the Great Lakes,'' in paragraph (b). The revision to paragraph (a) reflects the requirement expressed in
46 U.S.C. app. &sect;292 that vessels engaged in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States be documented
with a coastwise endorsement. The revision to paragraph (b) reflects the requirement expressed in 46 U.S.C. app.
&sect;316 that vessels engaged in towing, other than in circumstances of distress, in waters subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States be documented with an appropriate coastwide or Great Lakes endorsement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard proposes to revise several sections regarding citizenship requirements for vessel documentation.
These revisions would reorder and set out the citizenship requirements for a partnership in a separate section; describe
the citizenship requirements for a trust in detail to specify the requirements for each endorsement; set out the citizenship
requirements for an association or joint venture in a separate section; and reorder the citizenship requirements
for a corporation. None of the current citizenship requirements for these entities would be changed by the revisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;67.35 would set out the citizenship requirements for a partnership in a separate section
and in a more logical order. Currently, &sect;67.35 sets out the citizenship requirements for a partnership, association,
or joint venture together. The partnership is frequently used as a vessel-owning business entity for documentation
purposes and has citizenship requirements quite different from those of an association or joint venture. On the other
hand, the citizenship requirements for an association or joint venture as a vessel-owning business entity for documentation
purposes are the same. Setting forth the citizenship requirements for a partnership in a separate section would present
them in a more appropriate format. None of the current citizenship requirements for a partnership would be changed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 67.37, which sets forth the citizenship requirements for trust arrangements as vessel-owning entities,
would be redesignated as &sect;67.36. In addition, the citizenship requirements for trust arrangements would be
described in detail, like those for corporations and partnerships, to specify the requirements for the relevant
endorsements. Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;67.36 would set forth the general requirements for a registry or recreational
endorsement that each trustee and each beneficiary with an enforceable interest in the trust be citizens. This paragraph
would simply restate the current regulatory requirements for trusts found in &sect;67.37. Paragraphs (b) and (c)
of proposed &sect;67.36 would set forth the citizenship requirements for a fishery endorsement and a coastwise or
Great Lakes endorsement, respectively. These requirements would reflect the statutory citizenship requirements
for these endorsements applicable to any business entity owning a documented vessel. The owner citizenship requirements
for a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement may be found in &sect;2 of the Shipping act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. app. &sect;802)
and 46 U.S.C. 12107, respectively, and the owner citizenship requirements for a fishery endorsement may be found
in 46 U.S.C. 12108. The proposed regulatory requirements would reflect the Coast Guard's policy in enforcement of
the statutory requirements. None of the current citizenship requirements for trusts would be changed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed addition of a new &sect;67.37 would set out the citizenship requirements for associations and joint
ventures as vessel-owning entities for documentation purposes. The citizenship requirements for associations
and joint ventures are currently stated in &sect;67.35 with those for partnerships. However, there is no logical
reason to continue this grouping. Separating the requirements for associations and joint ventures, which are identical,
from those for partnerships would present the information in a more logical and orderly fashion. None of the current
citizenship requirements for associations or joint ventures would be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of &sect;67.39 would clarify the current regulations by rearranging
the citizenship requirements for corporations in a more logical order. None of the current citizenship requirements
for corporations would be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to paragraph (e) of &sect;67.119 would clarify the current regulations. Paragraph (e) of &sect;67.119
was intended to serve as a savings or ``grandfather'' provision with regard to hailing port requirements for vessels
issued a Certificate of Documentation prior to July 1, 1982. The language of the final rule implies that the provisions
of the entire section do not apply to the identified vessels, rather than only the provisions of paragraph (c). This
revision will remove the confusion that currently exists because of the omission from the final rule. The proposed
revision would clearly state that only the requirements of paragraph (c) of &sect;67.119, specifically that a hailing
port include a State, territory, or possession designation, do not apply to vessels issued a Certificate of Documentation
before July 1, 1982, until:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. a port of record assignment is required under the regulations, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the owner elects to designate a new hailing port. Therefore, vessels to which &sect;67.119(c) do not apply can display
a hailing port consisting of the name of a city only until either of the conditions described are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to &sect;67.145 would correct the cross-reference to appropriate paragraphs in &sect;67.167
where mortgagee consent is required to exchange a Certificate of Documentation. The current regulation cites, in
part, to paragraph (a) of &sect;67.167, which is incorrect since that paragraph contains only procedural information
and refers to the remaining paragraphs of that section. This cross-reference error has led to confusion, causing
some documentation officers to conclude that mortgagee consent is required for any cause of exchange listed in &sect;67.167.
The reasons requiring mortgagee consent contained in the paragraphs referenced in the amended language are those
for which consent has been traditionally required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to paragraph (d) of &sect;67.171 would clarify that the request for a certificate evidencing
deletion from documentation must be made to the vessel's port of record. Since the port of record is the custodian of
the vessel's file, only that port should issue a deletion certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;67.321 would clarify that when the address of the managing owner of a vessel changes,
the managing owner must report that change to the documentation officer at the vessel's port of record within 10 days
of its occurrence. This revision would conform &sect;67.321 to a similar requirement in &sect;67.113. Unreported
changes of address have proved to be a particularly bothersome problem. If changes of address for the managing owner
are not reported, the Coast Guard may send the renewal notice to the wrong address which can lead to late renewal or a
failure to renew with civil penalty action. The proposed revision would clarify the responsibility of the managing
owner to provide proper notice of changes of address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;67.539, adding the words ``or document'', would clarify that the fee is charged for
a copy of any instrument or document for which a specific fee is not listed. Also, the revision would clarify that the
cross-reference to 49 CFR 7.95 is solely for the purpose of calculating the fee in the same manner as described in that
section. It does not mean that a request for a copy of any instrument or document not specifically identified in Subpart
Y of Part 67 is to be processed as a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, once the fee for the
copy has been calculated in the manner described in 49 CFR 7.95, it is incorrect to refer to any other section in 49 CFR
Part 7 for any purpose with regard to the fee.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. As discussed earlier in this preamble,
this proposal, if adopted, would clarify the citizenship requirements of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, correct
certain errors and omissions made in the final rule for 46 CFR part 67, clarify a cross-reference with regard to calculation
of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and address the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed
in towing and dredging. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on the regulated
public.

Small Entities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal because it would only clarify the structure of a trust
as a vessel-owning entity, correct certain errors and omissions made in the final rule for 46 CFR part 67, clarify a
cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and address the statutorily
required endorsements for vessels employed in towing or dredging. This proposal would bring the regulations into
conformity with current policy and practice. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic
impacts on the regulated public. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'' or ``Proposed Rule'') published in the Federal Register, 58 FR 68841&hyph;68843
(Dec. 29, 1993), the Commission proposed to amend Rule 113, 46 CFR 502.113 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure to make the complainant in a private action responsible for service of its complaint when the Commission
has been unsuccessful, for any reason, in effectuating service by certified or registered mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only comment in response to the NPR was filed by the Maritime Administrative Bar Association (``MABA''), which
opposes the Proposed Rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Rule 113, the Commission is presently charged with the responsibility for service of private complaints, amendments
to complaints, and complainant's memoranda filed in shortened procedure cases, while Rule 114, 46 CFR 502.114, requires
that parties serve all other pleadings.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In administering Rule 113, the Commission has experienced occasions where complaints and other pleadings were returned
by the United States Postal Service because the respondent refused delivery, an incorrect address was provided by
the complainant, or the respondent had moved leaving no forwarding address. In such circumstances, the Commission
has resorted to alternative methods of service such as utilizing a Commission investigator to personally find and
serve the respondent, or serving the secretary of state pursuant to state law. The NPR noted that the Proposed Rule
would conform the Commission's Rules regarding service more closely to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Section 502.114 provides that all pleadings, documents, and papers (except requests for subpoenas) in proceedings
before the Commission shall, when tendered to the Commission or the presiding officer for filing, show that service
has been made upon all parties to the proceeding, and upon any other persons required to be served.

Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In opposing the Proposed Rule, MABA argues that the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. app. 821, and the Shipping Act of 1984,
46 U.S.C. app. 1710(b) (``Shipping Acts''), prohibit the Commission from shifting the burden of ``personally serving
private complaints from the Commission to private parties.'' Comments at 1&hyph;2. MABA's position is that only
the Commission can serve the complaint, and that a ``rule is which service of the complaint is performed by someone
other than the Commission does not comply with the clear statutory command that the Commission `shall furnish' a copy
of the complaint.''

 at 2. Regarding the Commission's interest in bringing Rule 113 in conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
MABA contends that the Federal Rules ``are not underlain by a similar statutory obligation that the district court
`furnish a copy of the complaint' to a defendant.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

reasons why the Commission should not abandon its statutory responsibility to serve a complaint.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MABA argues that the Shipping Acts' statutory provisions governing complaints mean what they say and that the Commission
is compelled to serve a respondent on behalf of a private complainant. It contends that because the Commission has
national jurisdiction, field offices, and an extensive regulated persons index, it is also in a better position to
personally serve the respondent. MABA believes that the Proposed Rule would place the burden of personal service
on small companies, thereby acting as a possible barrier to the prosecution of claims before the agency, and exacerbating
whatever service problems now exist.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon a reevaluation of the concerns that prompted this proposal, the Commission has decided not to proceed to a final
rule. Any actual service of process difficulties in a specific case will be addressed on an ad hoc basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is ordered, That the Proposed Rule is withdrawn and this proceeding is discontinued.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule publishes for public comment regulations that adopt the recommendations of the Government-Industry
Technical Data Advisory Committee established pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years
1992 and 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;190).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act required the Secretary of Defense to form a Government-Industry advisory committee to develop recommended
regulations to supersede the interim regulations which presently implement requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2320, Rights
in Technical Data. Committee meetings began in July 1992 and ended in December 1993. The committee concluded that
the existing regulations are a disincentive to companies that create new technology with their own funding to provide
that technology to the Defense Department. The committee believes this proposed regulation establishes a balance
between data developers' and data users' interests and will encourage creativity, encourage firms to offer DoD new
technology, and facilitate dual use development. The protection of privately developed data is crucial, particularly
for developers that have limited product lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule revises and retitles Defense FAR Supplement Subpart 227.4, Rights in Technical Data; adds a new
Subpart 227.5, Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation; amends Subpart 211.70, Acquisition
and Distribution of Commercial Products; and, amends Part 252, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses. Significant
differences from the exiting regulations are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
a. License Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule identifies any government rights in technical data or computer software as specific, nonexclusive,
license rights the contractor has granted the Government. The standard license rights are defined in the proposed
clauses at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' and 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights
in Noncommercial Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation.'' The rule provides that the contractor
retains all rights not granted to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
b. Non-Standard License Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule permits the negotiation of nonstandard license rights whenever the parties agree that the standard
rights are not appropriate for a particular procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
c. Elimination of ``Required for Performance'' Criterion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Existing DFARS regulations permit DoD to obtain unlimited rights in technical data if development was ``required
for the performance of a government contract or subcontract.'' This proposed rule eliminates that criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
d. Clarification of Indirect Cost Treatment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
10 U.S.C. 2320 requires implementing regulations to define the treatment of indirect costs. The existing regulations
require indirect costs of development to be considered government funded if development was required for the performance
of a government contract. This proposed rule provides for all development accomplished with costs charged to indirect
cost pools to be considered development accomplished at private expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
e. Standard Government Purpose Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing rule gives the government unlimited rights in technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes
developed with a mix of private and government funds unless the developer requests the exclusive right to commercialize
and a license can be negotiated. It does not permit negotiations when the government anticipates the data will be needed
for reprocurement. This proposed rule replaces those criteria with a standard license, applicable in all mixed funding
situations, which is intended to recognize mixed funded development. The license allows the government to use the
data for governmental purposes, including competition, but does not allow commercial use. Government purpose rights
will be effective for five years following award of the development contract or subcontract or such other period as
the parties negotiate. The Government has unlimited rights in the data upon expiration of the government purpose
rights period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
f. Segregation of Development Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule allows private expense determinations to be made at the lowest practicable level when determining
rights in technical data or computer software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
g. Commercial Items (Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The clause at 252.211&hyph;7015, ``Technical Data and Computer Software_Commercial Items is removed. This proposed
regulation adds a clause at 252.227&hyph;7015, ``Technical Data_Commercial Items'' that generally requires DoD
to acquire only the technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes that are customarily provided to the
public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
h. Separate Treatment for Computer Software
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A new Subpart 227.5, ``Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation'' and a new clause, 252.227&hyph;7014,
``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation'' are proposed to separate Computer
software from technical data. This separation increases the volume of the regulations but provides greater flexibility
to deal with new statutory requirements or technological advancements that affect either technical data or computer
software only or affect both to varying degrees. The term computer software documentation is defined in these regulations
to mean owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, and similar items that explain the capabilities
of the software or provide instructions for use. Therefore, although computer software documentation is a form of
technical data (10 U.S.C. 2302(4), most applicable requirements are contained in the software Subpart and clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
i. Software Related Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) The definitions of ``computer program'', ``computer software'', and ``computer software documentation''
are revised. Definitions of ``developed'' are added for computer programs, software, and documentation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(2) The definition of ``restricted rights'' is revised. The existing rule's right to use software with the computer
for which it was acquired is replaced by the right to use a program with one computer at one time. The Government's rights
to transfer programs, modify restricted rights software, and permit others to use or modify software for the Government
in specific situations, are clarified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
j. Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule provides that the Government shall have only the rights specified in the license under which the
commercial computer software or documentation is obtained. A contract clause is not prescribed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
k. Use and Nondisclosure Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The standard nondisclosure agreement contained in the existing rule is amended. The proposed agreement covers third
party use and disclosure of all data or software in which the Government's rights are restricted. The proposed regulations
permit the use of class nondisclosure agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
l. Contracts Under the Small Business Innovative Research Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Alternate 1 to the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 of the existing rule is replaced by a new clause, 252.227&hyph;7018,
``Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software_Small Business Innovative Research Programs.''
A single clause, rather than separate technical data and computer software clauses each with alternate provisions,
reduces contractual burdens on these small businesses. Data generated under these contracts is required to be protected
for five years instead of the four year statutory requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This proposed rule modifies the circumstances under which the Government may release or disclose technical data

(e) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 2305, solicitations for major systems development contracts shall not require offerors
to submit proposals that would permit the Government to acquire competitively items identical to items developed
at private expense unless a determination is made at a level above the contracting officer that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Procedures for acquiring technical data are contained in DoD 5010.12, DoD Data Management Program. Contracting
officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included
in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.403&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum
needs for technical data. Data needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's economic interests
in data pertaining to items, components, or processes that have been developed at private expense; the Government's
costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement needs; repair, maintenance and
overhaul philosophies; spare and repair part considerations; and, whether procurement of the items, components,
or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason
to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when replacement items or spare parts can be acquired using performance
specifications, form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of alternate sources which can
reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance
the original assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in the offer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Contracting officers are responsible for assuring that, to the maximum extent practicable, solicitations and
contracts_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media
in which the data will be delivered;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As required by 10 U.S.C. 2320, establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement
may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data item on an Exhibit to the contract);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable data item under a fixed price type contract;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable data item; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item of technical data.

(a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an identification prior to delivery of any technical
data to be delivered to the Government with restrictions on use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions''
in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items.''
The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data for which restrictions, other than copyright, on
use, release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertions to the offer.

Grant of license
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted
or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted
to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is
generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data
do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used
to create the data.

. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.403&hyph;5(a)(2) and (a) (4) through (9)), restrict
the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes
developed exclusively at private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's rights in items,
components, or processes developed exclusively at Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's
approval. When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the Government may use, release, or
disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction
but may release or disclose the data outside the Government only for Government purposes (government purpose rights).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or processes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Technical data may be created during the performance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that
does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components or processes.
The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with Government
funds, government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data was
created exclusively at private expense.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The determination of the source of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes
should be made at any practical sub-item or sub-component level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors
may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which otherwise qualifies
for limited rights under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data.''

The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights,
or limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013. In unusual situations, the standard
rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return
for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated
to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than
the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies
are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Form, fit, and function data;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing
or process data);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the contractor by the Government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions
on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other
assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or
its assets to another party;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of
negotiations; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has
expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government purpose rights
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled
to unlimited rights as provided in 227.403&hyph;5 (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9); or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture,
construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013
provides a nominal five year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose
rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party.
Longer periods should be negotiated when a five year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial
purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract
(or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development.
Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right
to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical
data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or
disclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government
contract that contains the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished
Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government
contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, the contract may be modified,
prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure
agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose
rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a government solicitation,
only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business
Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure
agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period)
are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data.
Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical
data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.

manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government
without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release or disclosure that is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure
is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize
others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure,
or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data
subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under 227.403&hyph;5(c)(2) (i)
or (ii), the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7 prior to release
or disclosure of the limited rights data.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specifically negotiated license rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government
or when the Government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish,
or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component,
or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement.
The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept
less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has
to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights
in a license agreement made part of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting
officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such
rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the
Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected
to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights. Prior to
negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent
items, components, or processes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition
among the sources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items
to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' in solicitations and
contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver technical data to the Government. Do not use
the clause when the only deliverable items are computer software or computer software documentation (see 227.5),
commercial items (see 227.402&hyph;3), existing works (see 227.405), or special works (see 227.406); in Architect-Engineer
and construction contracts (see 227.407); or, when contracting under the Small Business Innovative Research Program
(see 227.404).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Use the clause with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation
with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In the interest of the Government; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the
work for sale on behalf of the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7016, ``Rights in Bid or Proposal Data'', in solicitations and contracts when
the Government anticipates a need to use, subsequent to contract award, technical data included in a bid or proposal
that are not required to be delivered under the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information
Marked with Restrictive Legends'', in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will
provide the contractors, for performance of its contract, technical data marked with another contractor's government
restrictive legends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7028, ``Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government'',
in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical data. The provision
requires offerors to identify any technical data specified in the solicitation as deliverable data items that are
the same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor
or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.

Deferred delivery.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7026, ``Deferred Delivery of Technical Data and Computer Software'', when it is in
the Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The clause permits the contracting officer to
require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data at any time until two years after acceptance
by the Government of all items (other than technical data items) under the contract or contract termination, whichever
is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the
date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the
contract. The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer
shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery
of the data.

 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7027, ``Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software'', when a firm requirement
technical data has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this
clause, the contracting officer may order any technical data that has been generated in the performance of the contract
or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data)
under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such
technical data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When
the data are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the
technical data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', requires a contractor
to grant, or obtain for the government license rights which permit the government to reproduce data, distribute copies
of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The
extent to which the government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard
data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in technical data will be negotiated,
negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate
a copyright license that provides fewer rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted data
into a deliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when
applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval
to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the government will not receive a copyright license
only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the
third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure
Restrictions'', requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical
data that the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction,
release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification
and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the Attachment or
fails to complete the Attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure
shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance
with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed
by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted
restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an
asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.403&hyph;13.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with
the procedures at 227.403&hyph;13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract
Attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights
category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph
(d) of the solicitation provision. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical
Data_Noncommercial Items'' permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The
additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.

(4) neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified
in the Attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.403&hyph;13,
the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection
process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability
to use or disclose technical data. However, offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the
offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the technical data pertaining to such products and
offerors shall not be required, either as a condition or being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award,
to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater rights in technical data when the offeror to entitled to provide the technical
data with limited rights.

on the data, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain
restrictive markings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the Government
has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that data unless the parties have agreed
otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose the data have
expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate
restrictive legend for which the data qualified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Technical data delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed
to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable,
if a contractor has requested permission (see 227.403&hyph;10(c)(2)) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings,
do not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense.
The request must be received by the contracting officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such
data, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms
with the requirements for the marking of technical data contained in the ``Rights in Technical Data_Non-commercial
Items'' clause at 252.227&hyph;7013; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction,
or use of the technical data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical data were not distributed outside
the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', requires a contractor,
and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to establish
and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records
to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', requires contractors and their
subcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical
data delivered or to be delivered under a Government contract.

Nonconforming markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data.'' All other
markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from
the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 is also a nonconforming marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation
of Asserted Restrictions''. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data bearing
nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that person
an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person's expense. If the person who has placed
the nonconforming marking on the technical data fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected data
within 60 days following the person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity
at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting officers
may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction of the nonconformity,
the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unjustified markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the
Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical
data. For example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes
that were developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations
under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at
any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding the existence of a challenge, the contracting officer
and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon
such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If
the data are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected
data to the contracting officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall
be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose
technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under
10 U.S.C. 2321, the Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds
to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later
procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements.
Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of
the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction.
Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining
to the assertion. All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037,
``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''.

whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data_

Pre-challenge requests for information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) After consideration of the situations described in 227.403&hyph;13(c)(3), contracting officers may request
the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for
the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion.
Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion
does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information
or additional supporting documentation or if the information submitted does not justify the asserted restriction,
a challenge should be considered.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transacting matters directly with subcontractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under
the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting
officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the
Government when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were
disclosed to a higher tier contractor; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and a failure to
respond would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Challenge notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Do not issue a challenge notice unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. Assertions
may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested from the person asserting the restriction.
Challenge notices must be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the situations described
in 227.403&hyph;13(c)(3), the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice must include the information
in paragraph (d) of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of response time.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge notice,
as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare
a response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contracting officer's final decision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the assertion has
been justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued as soon as practicable
following the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer's challenge
within sixty (60) days, or any extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines
that an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction.
If the asserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the asserted restriction
to the contract Attachment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A contracting officer who determines that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall
issue a contracting officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation
of Asserted Restrictions.'' As provided in paragraph (f) of that clause, the Government is obligated to continue
to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the Agency Head notifies the
person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue
to respect the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the
earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted
restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction,
issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 2320_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requires contractors to furnish written assurance at the time technical data are delivered or are made available
to the Government that the technical data are complete, accurate, and satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning
such data; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate,
or not to satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies and agency head considers appropriate)
during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Conformity and acceptance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements the data
must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for
determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7030, ``Technical Data_Withholding of Payment'' provides for withholding up to
ten percent of the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation
of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount
or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the
relative value and importance of the data. for example_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may considerably higher
than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably higher
relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming
restrictive markings (see 227.403&hyph;14(b)(4)), correction or replacement of nonconforming data, or an equitable
reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not
in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for
nonconforming deliverables; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing
remedies for nonconforming deliverables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Follow the procedures at 227.403&hyph;12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason technical data
fail to conform to contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7030 may be used to withhold an amount from
payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, pending correction of the nonconforming markings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Warranty. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The intended use of the technical data and the cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before deciding
to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted
is not a consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the technical data that pertain to the
item, component, or process. For example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends to repair
or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data would impair the Government's effective use of the item
or result in increased costs to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246&hyph;7001, ``Warranty of Data'', and its alternates, or a
substantially similar clause when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.

Subcontractor rights in technical data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same protection for their rights in data as is provided
to prime contractors. The clauses at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', and
252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', implement the statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 10 U.S.C. 2321 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with the Government matters relating to the validation
of its asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical data. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037,
``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'' obtains a contractor's agreement that the direct transaction of validation
or challenge matters with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor
or supplier exercises its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers
shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.403&hyph;13(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification
except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers,
who will be furnishing technical data in response to a government requirement.

in lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' when the Government
requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose any technical data to be delivered
under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for Existing or Special Works.

were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract. Therefore,
the Government must obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work,
prepare derivative works, or perform or display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for the
content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner to indemnify the Government for liabilities that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, ``Rights in Special Works'' in solicitations and contracts where the Government
has a specific need to control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance
of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining
an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content,
performance, use, or disclosure of such works. Use the clause_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', when the Government
must own or control copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under
a contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' when the Government
must own or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered
under a contract. The specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in
a special contract requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause
at 252.227&hyph;7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the Government needs to restrict
a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically
restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted
by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government
a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works,
to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant
permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in
the deliverable work.

(a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that computer
software and computer software documentation requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy
expressed in 27.503&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum
needs. In addition to desired software performance, compatibility, or other technical considerations, needs determinations
should consider such factors as multiple site or shared use requirements, whether the Government's software maintenance
philosophy will require the right to modify or have third parties modify the software, and any special computer software
documentation requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for computer software or computer

(a) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions''
in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software
and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.'' The provision requires offerors to identify any computer
software or computer software documentation for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, modification,
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertion
to the offer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software
and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'' permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional
assertions of restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its alternates are at 227.503&hyph;6(a)(1).

. The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including a copyright
license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or documentation
or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The contractor
or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a computer
software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors
may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software developed
exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.503&hyph;5 (b) and (c)). They may not, without the Government's
agreement (see 227.503&hyph;5(d)) restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed exclusively
with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest practicable
segregable portion of the software or documentation (eg., a software sub-routine that performs a specific function).
Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise qualifies
for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial
Computer Software Documentation.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government
purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited
rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014. In unusual situations, the standard rights
may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other
consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide
the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights
provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated
in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.

Unlimited rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Computer software developed exclusively with government funds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under this contract;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor
by the government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released
or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other
than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to
another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another government
contract or as a result of negotiations; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the government, under a government contract
or subcontract with_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights
and the restrictive conditions have expired; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such software or documentation for commercial
purposes has expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government purpose rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided at 227.503&hyph;5(a), the Government obtains government purpose rights in computer software
developed with mixed funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014
provides a nominal five year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose
rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer
periods should be negotiated when a five year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software
form for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the
software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract
(or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the
computer software. Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights
in the software including the right to permit or authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer
software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release
or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights
to any person unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The intended recipient is a government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government
contract that contains the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished
Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a government
contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, the contract may be modified,
prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation
marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through
a government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements
in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.
Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company
within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government
purpose rights software or documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation
to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose
rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Restricted rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The Government obtains restricted rights in noncommercial computer software required to be delivered or otherwise
provided to the government under this contract that were developed exclusively at private expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise
provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government
must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. List
or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement
made part of the contract (see 227.503&hyph;5(d)). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specifically negotiated license rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government
or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating
to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software
maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance
for a particular procurement. If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider
the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized
release or disclosure. The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify,
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government
may authorize others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014 protects the Government's rights in computer software, computer software documentation,
or portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds
or includes in other software or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under the development
contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative software or documentation.

(a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer
Software Documentation'' in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver
computer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical
data (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software of commercial computer software
documentation, commercial items (see 227.402&hyph;3), special works (see 277.505), contracts under the Small
Business Innovative Research Program (see 227.404), or in Architect-Engineer and construction contracts (see
227.407). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Use the clause with the Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation

(ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish
the work for sale on behalf of the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'' in solicitations
and contracts that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014. The clause provides procedures for the validation of
asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', in solicitations and contracts
that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver noncommercial computer
software documentation (technical data). The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321. Paragraph
(d) of the clause contains information that must be included in a formal challenge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7016, ``Rights in Bid or Proposal Data'', in solicitations and contracts when
the Government anticipates a need to use, subsequent to contract award, computer software or computer software documentation
included in a bid or proposal that are not required to be delivered under the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information
Marked with Restrictive Legends'', in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will
provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, computer software or computer software documentation
marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7028, ``Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government'',
in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer
software documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in
the solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which
the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal
agency contract.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7026, ``Deferred Delivery of Technical Data and Computer Software'', when it is in
the Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause
permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data or computer
software at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer
software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers
to deliver such data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor
or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer
software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor
sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7027, ``Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software'', when a firm requirement
for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for computer
software or computer software documentation. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any computer
software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder
at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under
the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical
data or computer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract.
When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated
only for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.

(1) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software
Documentation'', requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the government license rights which permit the government
to reproduce the software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the software or documentation
and, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the government, and others acting
on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause.
When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate
the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate copyright
licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software
license. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than
the standard limited rights in technical data license.

(2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted software
into a deliverable software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and,
when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval
to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright
license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the
use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright
license.

reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit
the Attachment or fails to complete the Attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision,
such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality
in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the
time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted
restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an
asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.503&hyph;13.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with
the procedures at 227.503&hyph;13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract
Attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software
documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the
restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision. Subsequent to the contract award, the clause
at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'',
permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be
made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified
in the Attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.503&hyph;13,
the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection
process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability
to use computer software or computer software documentation.

(1) A contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation
to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive
markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or
may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions
into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend
or other license notice.

software documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's preexisting
rights in that software or documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's
rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions

(1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without
restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed
without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see 227.503&hyph;10(c)(2))
to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the software or documentation pending
evaluation of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked computer software or computer
software documentation at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within 6 months following
the furnishing or delivery of such software or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting
officer. The person making the request must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms
with the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in the ``Rights

and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software
Documentation'' requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software
or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures
to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity
of restrictive markings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'', requires contractors
and their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of markings
that assert restrictions on the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure
of computer software.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonconforming markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer
Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.'' All other markings are nonconforming markings.
An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause
at 252.227&hyph;7014 is also a nonconforming marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation
of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'' and the correction of non-conforming markings on computer software
documentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''.
To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software documentation
bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation
to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. If
that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days
following the person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the
nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software
documentation for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government
expense. Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive
marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unjustified markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the
Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer
software documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government
contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government
obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at
any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding the existence of a formal challenge, the contracting
officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified.
Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for
correction at that person's expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person fails to correct
or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer
within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected
or stricken at that person's expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,
release, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the
extent of the Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor
to submit sufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge
asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct prior to requesting
information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that
an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient
basis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.503&hyph;5(d)
when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction right not be
valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transacting matters directly with subcontractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The clause at 252.227&hyph;7019 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under
the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract.
Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly
with the Government when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were
disclosed to a higher tier contractor; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely
response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-award considerations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer
Software'' could significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions
prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion
of the procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Computer software documentation is technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Challenges to asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display,
or disclose computer software documentation must be made in accordance with the ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''
clause, 252.227&hyph;7037, and the guidance at 227.403&hyph;13. The procedures in that clause implement requirements
contained in 10 U.S.C. 2321. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process
described at 227.403&hyph;12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract.
The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires 3 years after final payment under the contract or three years
after delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's challenge rights do not
apply to software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been
otherwise made available without restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction.
Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted
restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.503&hyph;12(b)(2)
is strongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in 227.503&hyph;13(c), contracting officers
may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation
for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion.
Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the
contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate,
if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged
assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity
of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue
to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the Agency Head notifies the
person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue
to respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227&hyph;7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a determination
of urgent and compelling circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent
jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the
earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted
restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction,
issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

for nonconforming restrictive markings (follow the procedures at 227.503&hyph;12(a) if nonconforming markings
are the sole reason computer software tendered for acceptance fails to conform to contractual requirements), do
not accept software that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual requirements. Correction or
replacement of nonconforming software, or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement
of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance

The specific software or documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in
a special contract requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in the computer software or computer
software documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, the contractor retains
use and disclosure rights in that software or documentation. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights
to use or disclose the information contained in a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically
restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted
by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government
a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works,
to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission
only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable
work.

(d) Examples of other works which may be procured under this clause include, but are not limited to, audiovisual works,
scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of departments, agencies, services or
units thereof; surveys of Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers and
employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections
of data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate the right of privacy

Developed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed
or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed
or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability
that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability
depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed'',
the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market,
nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United
States Code.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited to, license fees, royalties,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1)_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the contractor to acquire
rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights
under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which
the technical data will be delivered.

 (1) The contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10
U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized
and protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever any technical data is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under
this contract, the contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and
require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. No other clause
shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's
rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next
higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract
for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor
or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a
higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers will not use their power to award contracts as economic
leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In no event shall the contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights
in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend
to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed
on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing
technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material
are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note,
or other appropriate identifier. Instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in
order to display a restrictive legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software
shall not be inserted in the software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, unless the contracting officer's
written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproduction of technical data,
computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said
subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government,
rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic
leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.

(5) In no event shall the contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights
in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

Justification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions
on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software
delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer
a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d)
or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Contractor agrees that the contracting officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors
or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause,
creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The contracting officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the contracting
officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required
by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Based upon the information provided, if the_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the contracting officer may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor
fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software to the contracting officer
within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software the contracting officer may correct or strike the markings
at that Contractor's expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contracting officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, he or she shall
so notify the Contractor in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a contracting officer's request for information or failure
to provide sufficient information to enable the contracting officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute
reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of
any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to
the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished
to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government
may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished
to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only
a contracting officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction
that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.

(iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with
paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient
detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) State that a contracting officer's final decision, during the three year period preceding this challenge, or
action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical
assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contracting officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing
the need for additional time to prepare a response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The contracting officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in his or her opinion, the Contractor's
explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor
agrees to promptly respond to the contracting officer's request for additional supporting documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Notwithstanding challenge by the contracting officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted
restriction at any time prior to a contracting officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision,
filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
or Board of Contract Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional information
under subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with
the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the contracting officer, after reviewing the written explanation furnished pursuant to subparagraph (f)(1)
of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines
that the asserted restriction has_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Not been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes''
clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes''
clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) A contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one contracting officer
shall notify each contracting officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which contracting officer
initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The contracting officer who initiated the first in time unanswered
challenge, after consultation with the other contracting officers who have challenged the restrictions and the
contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a reasonable opportunity for
responding to each challenge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a contracting officer's final decision denying the validity of
an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the contracting officer's final decision to allow the Contractor
to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For a period of one year from the date of the contracting officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90)
days following the contracting officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file
suit in an appropriate court; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if
the Contractor has: (A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit in an appropriate court within ninety
(90) days; or, (B) submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed
suite within one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor
fails to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of the contracting officer's final decision;
or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) File suit within one year after the date of the contracting officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided
notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the contracting officer's final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The agency head, on a non-delegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit
awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling
circumstances. Notwithstanding subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use,
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose
legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or, (ii) restricted or special license rights for government
purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless prior to release or disclosure,
the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7; or, is a government
contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at
252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive
Legends.'' The agency head's determination may be made at any time after the date of the contracting officer's final
decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided
by law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of draft modifications
to the Recovery Implementation Program Recovery Action Plan (RIPRAP) dated October 15, 1993. The RIPRAP identifies
specific actions and timeframes currently believed to be necessary to recover the endangered fish in the most expeditious
manner possible in the Upper Colorado River Basin (Upper Basin). The Upper Basin is defined as the Colorado River drainage
upstream of Lake Powell, with the exception of the San Juan River drainage. The RIPRAP will serve as a measure of accomplishment
so the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of
jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fish for projects undergoing section 7 consultations. Critical
habitat for the endangered fish was formally designated on April 20, 1994. The Recovery Program is also intended to
serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat. Therefore, modifications to the RIPRAP are being proposed so the Recovery Program can serve as the reasonable
and prudent alternative to avoid adverse modification to critical habitat as well as to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy
resulting from depletion impacts of new projects and all existing or past impacts related to historic water projects
with the exception of the discharge by historic projects of pollutants such as trace elements, heavy metals, and pesticides.
The proposed modifications were developed by FWS in coordination with the Recovery Program's Management Committee.
The Service solicits review and comment from the public on the draft changes to the RIPRAP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Four native fish species that inhabit the Colorado River Basin are federally listed as endangered: the Colorado sqawfish
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ptychocheilus lucius
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), humpback chub (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gila cypha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), bonytail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gila elegans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and razorback sucker (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Xyrauchen texanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Each of these four species was once abundant in the Upper Basin; however, they have declined in numbers and are now
threatened with extinction from their natural habitat. Factors accounting for the current status of these species
include direct loss of habitat, changes in water flow and temperature regimes, blockage of migration routes, and
interactions with introduced (nonnative) fish species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has maintained
since 1978 that a jeopardy situation exists in the upper Colorado River basin and that actions must be taken to reverse
the decline of endangered fish populations and habitat. The Service has described this conclusion through section
7 of the Endangered Species Act (Act) in over 224 biological opinions on project impacts on the endangered fish in the
Upper Basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, the Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the
Western Area Power Administration entered into a cooperative agreement to implement the Recovery Implementation
Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin (Recovery Program). The purpose of the Recovery
Program is to recover the four endangered fish in the Upper Colorado River Basin while providing for future water development
to proceed in compliance with the Endangered Species Act, Interstate Compacts, and State law. Participants in the
Recovery Program include the Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the States of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, the Western
Area Power Administration (Western), and representatives of the water development interests and conservation
groups. The Colorado River Energy Distributors Association is a nonvoting member of the Recovery Program. The ultimate
goal of the Recovery Program is to recover and delist the endangered fishes in the Upper Basin by restoring and establishing
self-sustaining populations and protecting sufficient habitat to support these populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Recovery Program also outlines procedures for section 7 consultations. the Service raised an issue with the Recovery
Program participants as to whether progress toward recovery of the fish has been sufficient to allow for the continued
issuance of favorable biological opinions. Discussions among the Recovery Program participants resulted in an
agreement, which was finalized on October 15, 1993, that clarified how section 7 consultations would be conducted
on depletion impacts related to new projects and impacts associated with historic projects (existing projects requiring
a new Federal action) in the Upper Basin. The Recovery Implementation Program Recovery Action Plan (RIPRAP) was developed
by the Recovery Program participants using the best information available and the recovery goals established for
the four endangered fish species. It identifies specific actions and timeframes currently believed to be required
to recover the endangered fish in the most expeditious manner possible in the Upper Basin. The RIPRAP also serves as
a measure of accomplishment so the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative
to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fishes for projects undergoing section
7 consultations. The Service also intends that the Recovery Program will serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative
which avoids the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. The final rule determining critical
habitat for the endangered fishes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 21, 1994, and the final designation became effective on April 20, 1994. The proposed changes continued in
the modified RIPRAP are designed to fulfill such intent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alternation
that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species.
Section 7 consultation is initiated by a Federal Agency when its action may affect critical habitat by impacting any
of the primary constituent elements or reduce the potential of critical habitat to develop those elements. The Primary
constituent elements determined necessary for survival and recovery of the four Colorado River endangered fishes
include, but are not limited to, water, physical habitat, and biological environment as defined in the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the specific actions in the existing RIPRAP not only contribute to allowing the Recovery Program to continue
to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence
of the endangered fishes, but also will avoid the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat
for the endangered fishes. Therefore, the proposed additions and changes to the RIPRAP which the Service believes
are necessary for the Recovery Program to continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects
undergoing section 7 consultations are not extensive. The proposed modifications are primarily intended to provide
further definition to already identified recovery actions in the RIPRAP and to provide increased certainty that
the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects subject to section
7 consultations.

A programmatic Environmental Assessment was completed on the Recovery Program in November 1987. The Environmental
Assessment provides an analysis and assessment of the impacts to the environment from Recovery Program implementation.
The October 1993 Agreement and RIPRAP, including the proposed changes, identify in more detail how the Recovery Program
will be carried out. Appropriate site specific NEPA compliance will be conducted on specific actions identified
in the RIPRAP.

 NMFS will hold four public hearings to receive comments from fishery participants and other members of the public
regarding proposed amendments to regulations governing the Atlantic tuna fisheries. The proposed amendments would
require: A Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document as a condition to import, export, or re-export fresh or frozen bluefin
tuna shipments into or from the United States by bluefin tuna dealers; a Federal permit for all dealers that purchase
or receive Pacific bluefin tuna for export; and a bi-weekly report and tagging requirement for Pacific bluefin tuna
dealers that export fish.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the regulations of the Department of Justice (Department) implementing titles II
and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to incorporate, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, the
ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities as they are revised in the interim rule with request for
comments being published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. In so doing, the proposed rule would establish new ADA standards for construction and alterations covered by the
Department's title II regulations. (The guidelines set forth in the Access Board's interim rule are effective only
as guidance for the Departments of Justice and Transportation; they have no effect on the public and should not be used
by the public until such time as the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation adopt them as standards.)
The proposed rule would also add new enforcement procedures to subpart F of the title II regulation.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1991, the Department published its final rules implementing titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, Pub. L. 101&hyph;336, 42 U.S.C. 12131&hyph;12134 and 12181&hyph;12189, which prohibits discrimination on
the basis of disability by public entities and in places of public accommodation and commercial facilities. 56 FR
35694, 35544. The Department's implementing regulations were codified at 28 CFR, parts 35 and 36. Subtitle A of title
II of the ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability in
the services, programs, or activities of all state and local governments. It extends the prohibition of discrimination
in federally assisted programs established by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, to all
activities of state and local governments, including those that do not receive federal financial assistance, and
incorporates specific prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of disability from titles I, III, and V of the ADA.
Title III of the ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability
by public accommodations and in commercial facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would amend 28 CFR 35.151 and 36.406 to adopt the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and
Facilities (ADAAG), as revised by the Access Board in their interim rule that is published elsewhere in this issue
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design (ADA Standards) for new construction and alterations covered by the Department's
title II regulation. The ADA Standards would apply to facilities designed, constructed, or altered after the effective
date of the amendment to &sect;35.151. The proposed rule would also remove the original ADA Standards for Accessible
Design, 28 CFR part 36, Appendix A; add the ADA Standards, as amended by the Access Board's interim rule, as Appendix
A to part 37; and amend parts 35 and 36 to correctly reference the redesignated ADA Standards. Finally, the proposed
rule would amend the Compliance Procedures in subpart F of part 35 to incorporate procedures used under agency regulations
implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for federally assisted programs and activities.

Accessibility Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 504 of the ADA requires the Access Board to issue supplemental Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible
Design of buildings and facilities subject to the ADA, including titles II and III. Sections 204(c) and 306(c) of the
ADA provide that the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations implementing titles II and III that are consistent
with the Access Board's ADA guidelines. In issuing its final title II regulation, the Department explained that it
intended to amend the regulation to adopt the new accessibility standards for title II after the Access Board had amended
its ADA Accessibility Guidelines to include specific requirements applicable to buildings and facilities operated
by entities subject to title II. The Access Board is now publishing its interim guidelines for title II elsewhere in
this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and this proposed rule would adopt those guidelines. Rather than having the ADA Standards for Accessible Design
published twice, as an appendix to both parts 35 and 36, this proposed rule would adopt the revised ADA Standards as
Appendix A to part 37. Parts 35 and 36 are amended to reference those standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board received public comments on its proposed guidelines, published on December 21, 1992, and is soliciting
comments on its interim rule, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department, as a member of the Access Board, will be actively involved in the review and analysis of the comments
that the Access Board receives on its interim guidelines and in making any revisions to the guidelines in response
to those comments. Therefore, the Department has proposed to adopt the guidelines, as revised by the Access Board
in its final rule, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. Comments submitted to the Access Board in response either
to its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or its Interim Rule, therefore, will also be considered by the Department as comments
on this proposed rule, and need not be separately submitted to the Department. Comments previously received by the
Access Board concerning provision of unisex restrooms will be considered by the Department of Justice through future
rulemaking or other action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28 CFR 35.151 would be replaced by &sect;&sect;35.151&hyph;35.155 of the proposed regulation. At present, &sect;35.151
provides that those buildings that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall
be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Current
&sect;35.151(c) establishes two standards for accessible new construction and alteration. Under paragraph (c),
design, construction, or alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards
(UFAS) or with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG)
is deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those facilities (except that, if ADAAG is
chosen, the elevator exemption does not apply). ADAAG was initially developed by the Access Board as a guideline for
accessibility to buildings and facilities that are subject to title III. It was adopted by the Department as the standard
for places of public accommodation and commercial facilities under title III of the ADA and was published as Appendix
A to the Department's regulation implementing title III, 28 CFR part 36, and amended on January 18, 1994, 59 FR 2674.
This rule removes that appendix and adds the Access Board's revised guidelines as Appendix A to 28 CFR part 37. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would revise 28 CFR 35.151 and add four new sections, 28 CFR 35.152&hyph;35.155, which follow the
format of parallel provisions in the Department's title III regulation at 28 CFR part 36, subpart D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 35.150&blank;Existing Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;35.150(a)(2), which provides that, in ensuring access to programs in existing
facilities, a public entity is not required to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance
of an historic property. The proposed amendment to &sect;35.150(a)(2) would incorporate the procedures set out
in section 4.1.7 of the ADA Standards for determining whether a physical alteration would threaten or destroy the
historic significance of an historic property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also amend &sect;35.150(b)(1) to make clear that the path of travel requirements of &sect;35.153
do not apply to measures taken solely to comply with program accessibility requirements. This amendment is consistent
with &sect;36.304(d)(1) of the title III regulation, which states that ``[t]he path of travel requirements of &sect;36.403
shall not apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 35.151&blank;New Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 35.151, as revised, would require that newly constructed facilities be readily accessible to and usable
by individuals with disabilities. Paragraph 35.151(b)(2) of the proposed rule incorporates the ADA's ``structural
impracticability'' exception for new construction. Under that exception, in new construction, full compliance
with the requirements of the ADA Standards is not required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally
impracticable to meet the requirements. However, full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable
only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility
features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute dictates that regulations promulgated under title II of the ADA ``shall be consistent with [the other
titles of] this Act'' as well as with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;336, &sect;204(b).
Furthermore, the legislative history of the ADA indicates that ``the forms of discrimination prohibited by [title
II are] identical to those set out in the applicable provisions of titles I and III.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong.,
2d Sess., pt. 2, at 84 (1990). Thus the structural impracticability exception for public accommodations and commercial
facilities contained in the Department of Justice title III regulations at 28 CFR 36.401(c) has been incorporated
in &sect;35.151 and is included in the ADA Standards at &sect;4.1.1(5)(a). Other revisions to this rule and to the
ADA Standards that render this rule and the ADA Standards consistent with title III, which are discussed below, are
based on this same statutory mandate and legislative history.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA, the Department's proposed rule states that the structural impracticability
exception will apply only in rare and unusual circumstances where unique characteristics of terrain make accessibility
unusually difficult. This exception is the same as the exception in the Department's title III regulation, 28 CFR

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36.401(c), and is narrower than the exception in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Fair Housing Accessibility
Guidelines (56 FR 9472 (1991)), which generally would allow exceptions from accessibility requirements, or allow
compliance with less stringent requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited structural impracticability exception adopted by the proposed rule would allow deviations from accessibility
requirements only where unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features
or where providing accessibility would destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in which a building
must be built on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an example of one of the few situations
in which the exception for structural impracticability would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, if full compliance with the accessibility standards would be structurally impracticable, compliance
is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. Any portion of the facility that can be made accessible
must be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In addition, if providing accessibility
to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable,
accessibility must nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches
or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.

Section 35.152&blank;Alterations: General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New &sect;35.152 of the proposed rule establishes the requirements for alterations. It includes a definition of
``alteration'' based on the Department's title III regulation. The term ``resurfacing'' is added to this definition
to be consistent with the Access Board's proposed change to the definition of alteration in ADAAG &sect;3.5. It also
adds a definition of the phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as used in &sect;35.152(a), which requires that
alterations be done, to the maximum extent feasible, in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is accessible.
That proposed definition is taken from the Department's title III regulation, 28 CFR 36.402(c), and provides that
the phrase applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to
comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In the occasional cases in which
full compliance is impossible, alterations shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Like the
structural impracticability exception for new construction, it requires that the facility be made accessible to
persons with other types of disabilities even if providing accessibility for individuals who use wheelchairs would
not be feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 35.153&blank;Alterations: Path of Travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;35.153, Alterations: Path of Travel, is also based on the title III regulation. UFAS and ADAAG both
contain requirements for provision of an accessible ``path of travel'' to the altered area when an existing facility
is altered, although the circumstances that trigger the requirements are somewhat different under each statute.
Under &sect;4.1.6(3) of UFAS, an accessible route to the altered area, an accessible entrance, and (where applicable)
accessible toilet facilities must be provided when a substantial alteration is made to an existing building. An alteration
is considered ``substantial'' if the total cost of all alterations within any twelve-month period amounts to 50%
or more of the full and fair cash value of the building. The proposed rule eliminates the UFAS ``substantial alteration''
basis for path of travel requirements because it eliminates UFAS as an option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The path of travel requirements of proposed &sect;35.153 are based on section 303(a)(2) of the ADA, which provides
that, when an entity undertakes an alteration to a place of public accommodation or commercial facility that affects
or could affect the usability of or access to an area that contains a primary function, the entity shall ensure that,
to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking
fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including
individuals who use wheelchairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;35.153 provides that areas such as mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage
rooms, employee lounges and locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and corridors are not areas containing
a primary function. Nor are restrooms areas containing a primary function unless the provision of restrooms is the
major reason that the facility is maintained by a public entity, such as at a highway rest stop. In that situation, a
restroom would be considered to be an ``area containing a primary function'' of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for an accessible path of travel does not apply, however, to the extent that the cost and scope of alterations
to the path of travel is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, as determined under criteria established
by the Attorney General. Sections 227 and 242 of the ADA adopt the same requirement for public transportation facilities
under title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.1.6(2) of the ADA Standards, which is not modified by the Access Board's proposed amendments, adopts the
statutory path of travel requirement, and &sect;36.403 of the Department's title III regulation establishes the
criteria for determining when the cost of alterations to the path of travel are ``disproportionate'' to the cost of
the overall alteration. The proposed rule would add a new &sect;35.153(d) to adopt the same disproportionality criteria
for facilities altered by public entities as are applied to private entities under title III. Alterations made to
provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area would be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration
when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As originally published, the ADA Standards consisted of nine main sections and a separate appendix. Sections 1 through
3 contain general provisions and definitions. Section 4 contains scoping provisions and technical specifications
applicable to all covered buildings and facilities. Sections 5 through 9 are special application sections and contain
additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and mercantile facilities,
libraries, and transient lodging. Section 10, which established requirements for transportation facilities,
was added on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2674). The appendix to the ADA Standards contains additional information to aid
in understanding the technical specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is now proposing to supplement the original ADA Standards by adding specific requirements applicable
to public entities. These requirements are set out in sections 11 through 14 of the Access Board's interim guidelines,
which are special application sections for facilities covered by title II. Section 11 would apply to Judicial, Legislative,
and Regulatory Facilities; section 12 to Detention and Correctional Facilities; section 13 to Accessible Residential
Housing subject to title II; and section 14 to Public Rights-of-Way. The Department's proposed rule would also amend
certain general requirements of the ADA Standards to clarify application to facilities covered by title II. (It would,
for example, clarify that the elevator exemption applies to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities,
but not to facilities covered by title II.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.151 of the current regulation applies to design, construction, and alteration of facilities if the construction
was commenced after the effective date of the regulation, January 26, 1992. Facilities under design for new construction
on that date were governed by that section if the date that bids were invited fell after the effective date. Alterations
were deemed to have commenced after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the property began after that date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;35.151, which provides that public entities could use either UFAS or ADAAG as the accessibility
standard, would be replaced by &sect;35.155, which adopts the ADA Standards (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Access Board's ADAAG as revised in the interim rule) as the applicable standard, as of the effective date of the
amendment. Consistent with federal practice under section 504, the new standard to be adopted by this proposed amendment
would not be applied retroactively. Facilities that were designed, constructed, or altered in conformance with
the requirements of &sect;35.151 prior to the effective date of this proposed amendment would not be required to be
retrofitted to conform to the new standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, newly constructed or altered facilities would continue to be covered by either UFAS or ADAAG if the construction
or alteration commenced between January 26, 1992, and the effective date of the proposed amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;35.155 could create a potential conflict between the revised regulation and the existing agency
regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for federally assisted programs. These section
504 regulations require that newly constructed or altered facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals
with disabilities and provide that facilities designed, constructed, or altered in conformance with UFAS shall
be deemed to comply with that requirement. Public entities that receive federal financial assistance, therefore,
would be required by this regulation to follow the ADA Standards, while, under section 504, they could also be required
to follow UFAS. This overlap between the requirements of title II of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
was one of the reasons that the current regulation allows public entities the option of using either UFAS or ADAAG.
Pursuant to its authority under Executive Order 12,250 for coordination of implementation and enforcement of section
504, therefore, the Department has advised the federal agencies that have regulations implementing section 504
for their federally assisted programs that facilities designed, constructed, or altered by a public entity in conformance
with the proposed ADAAG should be deemed to comply with the requirements for new construction and alterations of any
regulation implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act that applies to that public entity. Private entities
that receive federal financial assistance would continue to be governed by the standards in any applicable regulation
implementing section 504. It is expected that, when ADA Standards proposed in this rule are finalized, the agencies
with enforcement responsibilities under section 504 will amend their regulations to adopt the ADA Standards as the
standard for new construction and alterations. In the interim, the agencies that enforce section 504 should not require
public entities to conform to both UFAS and ADAAG.

Enforcement Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart F of the current regulation establishes administrative procedures for enforcement of title II of the ADA.
Section 203 of the ADA adopts the ``remedies, procedures, and rights'' provided in section 505 of the Rehabilitation
Act, 29 U.S.C. 794a, as the enforcement procedures for title II. Section 505, in turn, incorporates by reference the
remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d&hyph;4a).
Section 204 of the ADA, which requires the Department to issue regulations to implement subtitle A of title II, requires
that the regulations be consistent with the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs
and activities at 28 CFR Part 41. The House Committee on Education and Labor explained that it expected the Attorney
General to use the section 504 enforcement procedures as the model for title II enforcement. H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st
Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 98 (1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by sections 203 and 204(b) of the ADA, the proposed enforcement procedures are the procedures for enforcement
of section 504, which, in turn, adopt the enforcement procedures for title VI. Title VI, which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of race, color, or national origin in federally assisted programs and activities, is enforced by the federal
agencies that provide the federal financial assistance to the covered programs and activities in question. If voluntary
compliance cannot be achieved, federal agencies enforce title VI either by the termination of federal funds to a program
or activity that is found to discriminate, following an administrative hearing, or by a referral to the Department
of Justice for judicial enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II of the ADA extended the requirements of section 504 to all services, programs, and activities of state and
local governments, not only those that receive federal financial assistance. Subpart F of the Department's original
regulation establishes basic procedures to be followed by the agencies designated in subpart G for processing complaints
against state and local government entities when the designated agency does not have jurisdiction under section
504. As required by section 204(b) of the ADA, these procedures are consistent with the Department's coordination
regulation for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 28 CFR 41.5(a)(1), which directs agencies to adopt the enforcement
procedures of their title VI regulations for enforcement of section 504. Although section 203 of the ADA mandates
that the title II procedures be the same as the section 504 procedures, the final rule did not detail procedures for
investigations other than those based on individual complaints. Nor did it include requirements for cooperation
by public entities in investigations, as required under title VI. This proposed rule would clarify &sect;&sect;35.172
and 35.174 of subpart F by specifically incorporating the language of the regulations implementing title VI and section
504 for federally assisted programs with respect to those provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.172 of the Department's current regulation requires designated agencies to investigate all complete
complaints for which they were responsible as determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;35.171. It requires the designated agency to issue a Letter of Findings at the conclusion of the investigation
if the complaint was not resolved informally, and to attempt to negotiate a voluntary compliance agreement if a violation
was found. It does not, however, include specific procedural requirements for investigations, and does not address
compliance reviews that are not based on individual complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;35.172, captioned Investigations and Compliance reviews, makes clear that the same procedures
that apply to complaint investigations also apply to compliance reviews that are not initiated by receipt of a complaint,
but rather are based on other information indicating that discrimination exists in a service, program, or activity
covered by this part. This provision is consistent with the Department's procedures for enforcing title VI at 28 CFR
42.107, as required by the section 504 coordination regulation at 28 CFR 41.5(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of proposed &sect;35.172 explicitly spells out the agency's authority to require a public entity to
cooperate in the investigation by permitting access by the designated agency to its records and other sources of information
and to its facilities. It also makes clear that access by the designated agency may not be barred on the basis of considerations
of privacy or confidentiality and that confidential information obtained by the designated agency shall not be disclosed
except where necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or where otherwise required by law. These provisions of
the proposed rule are based on the enforcement procedures for title VI and section 504 in federally assisted programs,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 28 CFR 42.106 (Department of Justice title VI regulation, as incorporated in the Department of Justice section 504
regulation by 28 CFR 42.530); 45 CFR 80.6, 80.7 (Department of Health and Human Services). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.173 of the current regulation establishes requirements for voluntary compliance agreements and would
not be changed by the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.174 of the current regulation and &sect;35.174(a) of the proposed regulation provide for referral of
a matter to the Department of Justice when a public entity declines to enter into voluntary compliance negotiations
or when negotiations are unsuccessful. The proposed rule adds a new &sect;35.174(b), which provides that the designated
agency may refer the matter to the Department with a recommendation for appropriate action or use any other means authorized
by law to achieve compliance when there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part that cannot
be corrected by informal means. This provision is taken from language in existing title VI and section 504 regulations
for federally assisted programs.

ADA Standards for Accessible Design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the regulations of the Department of Justice implementing titles II and III of the ADA
to incorporate, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities,
currently Appendix A to 28 CFR Part 36, as they are revised in the Access Board's interim rule published elsewhere in
this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (The guidelines set forth in the Access Board's interim rule are effective only as guidance for the Departments of
Justice and Transportation; they have no effect on the public and should not be used by the public until such time as
the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation adopt them as standards.) The ADA Standards will be
set forth in full in the new part 37 of 28 CFR when this rule is printed in final.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ADA Standards set out in the Access Board's interim rule supplement the original ADA Standards by adding specific
requirements applicable to public entities. These requirements are set out in sections 11 through 14 of the Access
Board's interim guidelines, which are special application sections for facilities covered by title II. Section
11 would apply to Judicial, Legislative, and Regulatory Facilities; section 12 to Detention and Correctional Facilities;
section 13 to Accessible Residential Housing subject to title II; and section 14 to Public Rights-of-Way. For a section-by-section
analysis of these requirements, see the Access Board's preamble to its interim rule published in today's

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to purely editorial changes, the Access Board's interim rule contains several substantive changes that
needed to be made to &sect;&sect;3, 4, 7, and 10 of ADAAG, either as a result of the addition of new sections 11&hyph;14
or to make certain provisions of ADAAG specifically applicable to title II facilities. These changes are discussed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;3.5, the definition of ``alteration'' is revised to explicitly cover pedestrian facilities in the public
right-of-way and to include resurfacing. This change is consistent with the decision in

114 S. Ct. 1545 (1994), holding that resurfacing of a street constitutes an alteration under the ADA. Also in &sect;3.5,
definitions are being added for the following terms: continuous passage, public right-of-way, public sidewalk,
public sidewalk curb ramp, principal public entrance, site infeasibility, and technically infeasible; and the
term text telephone is being replaced with the term TTY. Finally, the definition of ``transient lodging'' is revised
to include residential facilities rather than facilities that contain one or more dwelling units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general exception in &sect;4.1.1(5)(b)(i) is expanded to include all raised areas used primarily for purposes
of security or life or fire safety; several more examples are added to the non-occupiable spaces listed in &sect;4.1.1(5)(b)(ii);
and &sect;4.1.1(5)(b)(iii) is added to exempt single-occupant structures accessed only by passageways below grade
or elevated above grade, such as certain toll booths.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exception 1 to &sect;4.1.3(5) is expanded to exempt the upper level of drawbridge towers, boat traffic towers, lock
and dam control stations, train dispatching towers, and similar structures less than three stories and not open to
the general public if the upper level houses no more than five persons and is less than 500 square feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exception 4 to &sect;4.1.3(5) is expanded to allow platform lifts to provide access to raised judges' benches, clerks'
stations, speakers' rostrums, raised daises, jury boxes, and witness stands, and to connect levels within an individual
dwelling unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exception 5 is added to &sect;4.1.3(5) to exempt the cab level and, in some instances, the penultimate floor of air
traffic control towers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language is added to &sect;4.1.3(8)(a)(i) to require that, in facilities subject to title II, all planned principal
public entrances shall be included within the 50% of public entrances required to be accessible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.1.3(17)(c)(ii) is expanded to require that, in stadiums, arenas, and convention centers subject to title
II, at least one public TTY shall be provided on each floor level having a public pay telephone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 4.1.3(17)(c) (iv) and (v) are added to require that if an interior public pay telephone is provided in a public
use area of a facility covered by title II, at least one interior public TTY shall be provided in at least one public use
area, and if an interior public pay telephone is provided in the secured area of a detention or correctional facility
subject to section 12, then at least one public TTY shall also be provided in at least one secured area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception is added to &sect;4.1.3(17)(d) to exempt the secured areas of detention or correctional facilities
where shelves and outlets are prohibited for purposes of security or safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.1.3(22) is added to require that permanently-installed swimming pools subject to title II shall be designed
so as to provide at least one means of access into the water, if such swimming pools are intended for recreational purposes
and not intended solely for diving or wading.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The previously-reserved exception to &sect;4.1.7(1)(a) is added to allow alternative methods of access if it is
determined that it is not feasible to provide physical access to a qualified historic building or facility in a manner
that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7.2(3) is added to cover title II facilities, and requires that, where counters have cash registers and are
provided for the sale or distribution of goods or services to the public, at least one of each type shall comply with
7.2(1); at counters that may not have cash registers but at which goods or services are sold or distributed, a portion
of the main counter shall be accessible or an accessible auxiliary counter shall be provided in close proximity; and
at counter or teller windows with solid partitions or security glazing separating personnel from the public, at least
one of each type shall provide a method to facilitate voice communication that is accessible to both individuals who
use wheelchairs and individuals who have difficulty bending or stooping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10.4.1(8), which was previously reserved, is added to require that, in airports covered by title II, at least
one accessible route shall be provided through fixed security barriers, and where security barriers incorporate
equipment, such as metal detectors, which cannot be made accessible, an accessible route shall be provided adjacent
to such security screening devices. An exception is also added to this section to exempt doors, doorways, and gates
designed to be operated only by security personnel from the requirements of 4.13.6, 4.13.9, 4.13.11, and 4.13.12.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, appendix notes are added for the following sections: 3.5 (definition of transient lodging); 4.1.3(8)(a)(i)
(public entrances); 4.1.3(8)(b) (path of travel to building entrances); 7.2(3)(iii) (counter or teller windows
with partitions); and 10.4.1(8) (security systems in transportation facilities).

Regulatory Process Matters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order
12866. The Access Board has analyzed the impact of applying its proposed amendments to ADAAG to entities covered by
titles II and III of the ADA and has determined that they are a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive
Order 12866. The Access Board has prepared a Regulatory Assessment, which includes a cost impact analysis for certain
accessibility elements and a discussion of the regulatory alternatives considered. Adoption of the revised ADA
Standards as the standards for title II is, therefore, also a significant regulatory action to which the Access Board's
Regulatory Assessment would apply. Comments submitted to the Access Board on its Regulatory Assessment will also
be considered by the Department as comments on this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board has determined that this proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and, therefore, has included the flexibility analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility
Act in its Regulatory Assessment. The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the economic impacts of its proposed
rule on small entities, but recognizes that such impacts are the necessary result of the mandate of the ADA itself.
The Access Board's analysis also applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the revised ADAAG. The Department's
proposed procedural amendments will not have a significant economic impact on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the impact of its proposed guidelines on state and local governments,
but recognizes that the guidelines will have some federalism impacts. These impacts are discussed in the Access Board's
Regulatory Assessment, which also applies to the Department's proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12875 prohibits executive departments and agencies from promulgating any regulation that is not
required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a state, local, or tribal government unless certain conditions
are met. The Access Board is required by statute to issue minimum guidelines for the purposes of implementing titles
II and III of the ADA (42 USC 12204). The Department of Justice is required by statute to promulgate regulations that
implement title II of the ADA and that are consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the Access
Board (42 USC 12134). Because the Department of Justice is required by statute to promulgate regulations that do not
go below the Access Board's minimum guidelines, and because this rule adopts guidelines issued by the Access Board
as also required by statute, this rule is required by statute. Therefore, the special conditions in Executive Order
12875 need not be met. However, the Department will provide any comments submitted that suggest ways to make compliance
less burdensome or that would improve the effectiveness of the title II regulation in achieving its objective.

 (1) Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects
or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered
in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,
if the alteration was commenced after January 26, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alteration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the purposes of this part, an alteration is a change to a facility that affects or could affect the usability of the
building or facility or any part thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic
restoration, resurfacing, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement
in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering,
asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability
of the building or facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall
comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A to part 37 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To the maximum extent feasible.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as used in this section, applies to the occasional case where the nature
of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through
a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility
feasible. Any altered features of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing
accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs)
would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those
who use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments).

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary
function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and
the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable
by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations
is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary function.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A ``primary function'' is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function
include, but are not limited to, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in
which the activities of the public entity using the facility are carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets,
entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Restrooms are not areas containing a primary
function, unless the provision of restrooms is the principal purpose of the area, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in highway rest stops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage
shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Path of travel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A ``path of travel'' includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered
area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including
sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian
ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators
and lifts; or a combination of these elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For the purposes of this part, the term ``path of travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking
fountains serving the altered area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disproportionality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to
the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example,
the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls,
insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible
height, installing amplification devices, or installing a telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate
to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible
without incurring disproportionate costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide
the greatest access, in the following order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An accessible entrance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An accessible route to the altered area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Accessible telephones; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Accessible drinking fountains; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Series of smaller alterations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations
to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to
that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations
to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in
determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Only alterations undertaken after the effective date of this amendment shall be considered in determining if
the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.

(a) Alterations to buildings or facilities that are ``historic properties'' as defined in &sect;35.104 shall comply,
to the maximum extent feasible, with section 4.1.7 of appendix A to part 37 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If it is determined under the procedures set out in section 4.1.7 of appendix A to part 37 of this chapter that it is
not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic
significance of the building or facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements
of &sect;35.150.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A public entity shall permit access by the designated agency during normal business hours to books, records, accounts,
and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Whenever
any information required of a public entity is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person
and that agency, institution, or person fails or refuses to furnish that information, the public entity shall so certify
in its report and shall set forth the efforts that it has made to obtain the information. Asserted considerations of
privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar the designated agency from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance
with this part. Information of a confidential nature obtained in connection with compliance evaluation or enforcement
shall not be disclosed except where necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or where otherwise required by law.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is proposing to amend its rules implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by adopting
as its standards revised accessibility guidelines issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board (Access Board). The Access Board has published these revised accessibility guidelines as interim final rules
elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed rule would also make a conforming change to the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended. The rules would expand the Department's accessibility standards to cover public rights-of-way
and other subjects added by the Access Board to its guidelines.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 All timely comments received by the Access Board on its guidelines published December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60612), and on
its interim final rule published today, will be deemed by the Department to have been submitted in response to this
proposed rule and will be considered fully as the Department works toward a final rule based on this proposal. Therefore,
it is not necessary for any comments submitted to the Board on its proposed or interim rules to be resubmitted to the
Department.

, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) is publishing amendments to its accessibility
guidelines for buildings and facilities, relating to state and local government facilities. The Department's September
6, 1991, final Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rule (49 CFR Part 37) adopted the original version of these guidelines,
known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), as its accessibility standards
for facilities subject to Part 37. The standards are codified as Appendix A to 49 CFR Part 37.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would adopt the amended Access Board guidelines as a new Appendix A to Part 37, replacing the Department's
current Appendix A. The Access Board received public comments on its proposed guidelines, published on December
21, 1992, and will receive comments again on today's interim final rule. As a member of the Access Board, the Department
will be actively involved in the review and analysis of comments the Access Board receives and in making any revisions
on the guidelines in response to those comments. Therefore, the Department has proposed to adopt the amended guidelines
as its accessibility standards. Comments submitted to the Access Board will be considered by the Department as comments
on this proposed rule, and need not be separately submitted to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the Department of Justice's existing rule implementing Title II of the ADA, for state and local government
facilities, the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (49 CFR Part 27) gives
recipients the choice, in some circumstances, of complying either with the ADAAG or with the older Uniform Federal
Accessibility Standard (UFAS). In its ADA proposal being published today, DOJ is proposing to eliminate the option
to use UFAS. Title II entities would have to use ADAAG in all cases. To remain consistent with Access Board and Department
of Justice actions, the Department is also proposing to eliminate the UFAS option. To this end, the Department proposes
to revise its 504 rule to require design, construction, or alteration of all facilities subject to Part 27 to conform
to the revised AADAG. As a technical amendment, the Department is also proposing to update a reference in Part 27 to
Department of Justice ADA regulations.

On November 30, 1993, the Department amended Part 37 to extend the compliance deadline for the requirement to install
detectable warnings on platform edges of key rail stations. The final rule reaffirmed the Department's view that
detectable warnings are an essential safety feature of rail stations for persons with impaired vision. The Department
is not, through this proposal, seeking further comment on the issue of detectable warnings on rail station platform
edges. The Department will regard any comments received on this subject as outside the scope of this rulemaking.

Regulatory Analyses and Notices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This NPRM has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Access Board has
analyzed the impact of applying its amendments to ADAAG to entities covered by Titles II and III of the ADA and has determined
that they are a significant regulatory action for purposes of the Executive Order. The Access Board has also prepared
a Regulatory Assessment, which includes a cost impact analysis for certain accessibility elements and a discussion
of the regulatory alternatives considered. This Regulatory Assessment applies to the Department's proposed adoption
of the Access Board's guidelines. Comments submitted to the Access Board on its Regulatory Assessment will be considered
by the Department as comments on this NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board has determined that its guidelines will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and, therefore, has included in its Regulatory Assessment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.
The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the economic impacts of its proposed rule on small entities, but recognizes
that such impacts are the necessary result of the mandate of the ADA itself. The Access Board's flexibility analysis
also applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the revised ADAAG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board also made every effort to lessen the impact of its proposed guidelines on state and local governments,
but recognizes that the guidelines will have some federalism impacts. These impacts are discussed in the Access Board's
Regulatory Assessment which, as noted above, also applies to this NPRM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 17, 1994, the FAA issued Notice No. 94&hyph;4, entitled ``Overflights of Units of the National Park System.''
Notice No. 94&hyph;4 sought comment on general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory
actions to address the effects of aircraft overflights on national parks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a request dated May 12, 1994, the NPCA asked that the comment period be extended 30 days. The NPCA explained that,
unlike the airtour industry and other vested interests that have formed cohesive groups with streamlined communications
systems, its 400,000 members are individual citizens who share an interest of protecting and preserving the national
parks and national park values and are reliant on periodic contact with the NPCA. It indicated that the additional
time would allow it to make the contents of the notice available to interested members, and allow it sufficient time
to digest the notice and draft and file comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to give the NCPA and its members additional time to prepare comments, the FAA finds that it would be in the public
interest to extend the comment period by 30 days. Accordingly, the comment period is being extended to July 15, 1994,
to afford all interested persons the opportunity to comment on this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for regulating the care and use of farm animals
for nonagricultural activities. In September 1993, APHIS hosted an open forum in Oklahoma City, OK, to canvass the
concerned public for recommendations and opinions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the housing, care, handling, and unique practices applied to the nonagricultural uses of farm animals. The forum
addressed almost exclusively the concerns of the agricultural and nonagricultural research industry in respect
to these issues. In December 1993, APHIS held a meeting attended solely by Federal personnel representing various
governmental agencies, also to discuss issues concerning the care and use of farm animals for nonagricultural activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the public meeting announced in this notice is to obtain input from the general public, animal scientists
and researchers, exhibitors, dealers, commercial animal transporters, and animal protection groups concerning
the issues discussed above. Topics addressed may include, but need not be limited to: (1) Agricultural exemptions;
(2) agricultural versus nonagricultural environments; (3) the well-being of farm animals; and (4) special considerations
for major operative procedures. We emphasize that the meeting will focus only on farm animal issues that are subject
to the Animal Welfare Act; issues concerning farm animals used in production agriculture are not subject to the Animal
Welfare Act. The comments received during the meeting will aid APHIS in developing regulations and standards for
the humane care and treatment of farm animals used for nonagricultural activities that are subject to the Animal Welfare
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting on July 7, 1994, will begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m.; however, the meeting may end earlier if all persons
desiring to speak have been heard. We ask that persons who wish to speak register with APHIS by submitting their request
in writing to Ms. Joy DeArce, Animal Care Program Specialist, REAC, APHIS, USDA, room 568&hyph;C, Federal Building,
6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, no later than July 1, 1994. Participants should limit presentations to
10 minutes in order to allow everyone wishing to speak an opportunity to be heard. Any person attending the meeting
who did not register with APHIS by July 1 will be given an opportunity to speak after the registered speakers have completed
their presentations, as time permits. All participants are requested to submit a written or computer disc copy of
their presentation to APHIS on the day of the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any person who is unable to attend the public meeting but wishes to comment, or any person who attends the public meeting
but wishes to submit additional comments, may send written comments to Ms. Joy DeArce, at the address listed for her
above, no later than July 22, 1994.

1. El Paso Natural Gas Company
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on June 1, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), Post Office Box 1942, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed
an application at Docket No. CP94&hyph;575&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing El Paso to construct and operate its San Juan Triangle Expansion
Project, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso proposes to construct and operate about 29.7 miles of 34-inch loop pipeline with appurtenances on the Loop
Line from Blanco Plant to the Gallup Compressor Station, and to install a replacement compressor on one of the turbines
at El Paso's Gallup Compressor Station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that the approximate cost of the project is $25.8 million, with a resultant third year cost of service
of only approximately $4 million which is an impact on current rates, assuming a 100 percent load factor, of $.0021
per dth. El Paso proposes rolled-in rate treatment for these costs in its first general system-wide rate proceeding
following the in-service date of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that in its ongoing review of the operating requirements and capabilities of its interstate pipeline
system, together with the potential availability of additional volumes to its system, El Paso has determined that
expansion of its San Juan Triangle is warranted. El Paso states that the existing summer design capacity of the San
Juan Triangle System is 2,460 MMcf of natural gas per day. El Paso's asserts that its studies indicate that the total
supply available from the San Juan Basin will approach 3300 MMcf per day in 1997. El Paso states that the proposed facilities
would allow it to receive additional quantities of natural gas which are available today and are projected to become
available in the immediate future from the San Juan Basin area of a New Mexico and Colorado. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that it does not seek specific authorization to transport gas through its proposed facilities for specific
shippers. El Paso states that it would render transportation services through such facilities under Part 284 of the
Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso further states that it would charge its current and effective Part 284 rates for transportation through the
proposed facilities. El Paso further states that it would propose in its first general system-wide rate proceeding
following the in-service date of the project to ``roll-in'' the actual costs of the completed facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso requests that the Commission issue authorization no later than December 31, 1994, because it must initiate
construction soon thereafter in order to meet a scheduled in-service date of July 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Viking proposes to establish an additional delivery point consisting of a 2-inch hot tap, measurement and data acquisition
equipment, located in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin. Viking states that the tap would be used to provide an additional
delivery point of 512 Mcf of natural gas per day for gas transportation services which Viking currently provides for
Northern States Power Co._Wisconsin (NSPW). Viking estimates the cost of these facilities to be $117,750, and states
that NSPW agreed to reimburse Viking for the cost of these facilities. Viking further states it would offer the proposed
service within the existing certificated transportation entitlement of Viking's FERC Rate Schedule FT&hyph;A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Viking reports that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the proposed deliveries without detriment to its other
existing customers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on June 6, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tenneco) located at P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas,
77252&hyph;2511, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;587&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act. Tenneco requests that the Commission issue an order permitting it to uprate an existing compressor unit that
will permit National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) to provide firm natural gas transportation service
for four shippers. Tenneco requests authorization to uprate by 1,000 horsepower an existing compressor unit at station
230C, Lockport New York, to permit National to provide additional firm transportation services in an aggregate maximum
quantity of 10,270 Dth per day, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco states that pursuant to the terms of a Construction and Ownership Agreement (C&amp;O Agreement) and as operator
and co-owner of the Niagara Spur Loop Line it is requesting Section 7(c) authorization. National has notified Tenneco
and the other co-owners of its intention to use its expansion rights to serve four shippers. Additionally, pursuant
to the C&amp;O agreement National has requested that Tenneco uprate an existing compressor on the Niagara Spur Loop
Line to permit the transportation of gas from the Niagara import point to an interconnection with National's facilities
at East Aurora, New York.

Take notice that on June 7, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah
84158, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;590&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205, 157.211, and 157.216
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211, and 157.216) for authorization
to replace certain metering facilities at its Burbank Heights Meter Station (Burbank Station) in Franklin County,
Washington, in order to better accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to Cascade
Natural Gas Corporation (Cascade), under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northwest states that it presently has firm obligations to deliver up to a total of 10,002 Dt per day (at 400 psig) under
Rate Schedules TF&hyph;1 and TF&hyph;2, to Cascade at the Burbank delivery point. Northwest further states that
the Burbank Station was originally certificated with a maximum design delivery capacity of approximately 8,517
Dt per day (at 400 psig). Since the maximum design capacity of the Burbank Station is less than Northwest's firm delivery
obligation to Cascade, Northwest is proposing to upgrade the Burbank Station by replacing the two existing 2 inch
regulators with two new 3 inch regulators. Northwest states that it also plans to replace the relief valve and associated
valves and piping and to install electronic flow measurement equipment. It is stated that the proposed facility upgrade
will increase the maximum design delivery capacity of the Burbank Station from 8,517 Dt per day to approximately 24,670
Dt per day at a pressure of 400 psig.

Northwest has estimated the cost of the proposed facility upgrade at the Burbank Station to be approximately $280,294,
which exclude the cost of removing the old facilities. Northwest avers that since this expenditure is necessary in
order for Northwest to accommodate existing MDDO's at the Burbank Station, Northwest will not require any cost reimbursement
from Cascade.

Take notice that on June 7, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, S.E.,
Charleston, West Virginia 25314&hyph;1599, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;593&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections
157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization
to construct and operate an additional point of delivery for interruptible transportation service under Part 284
of the Commission's regulations. Delivery will be to Newell Porcelain Company, Inc. (Newell) in Hancock County,
West Virginia, under Columbia's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;76&hyph;000 pursuant to Section
7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia proposes to provide the interruptible transportation service pursuant to its blanket certificate issued
in Docket No. CP86&hyph;240&hyph;000 and under existing authorized Rate Schedule ITS within certificated entitlements
(which may be provided under firm capacity released by other shippers). Columbia estimates the maximum daily quantity
to be 400 Dekatherms per day (Dth) and estimates the annual quantity to be 146,000 Dth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional point of delivery has been requested by Newell, an end-user, for interruptible transportation service
for industrial use. There is projected to be no impact on Columbia's existing design day and annual obligations because
of the interruptible nature of service to be provided. The estimated cost to construct this point of delivery will
be approximately $44,290 which includes gross-up for income tax purposes and Columbia will be reimbursed for the
total cost by Newell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia says that it will comply with all of the environmental requirements of Sections 157.206(d) prior to construction

Specifically, Northern is requesting permission and approval to abandon a transportation service it performs for
Midwest Gas. Northern states that this service was initially authorized by Commission order issued July 24, 1973,
in Docket No. CP73&hyph;282, and is being performed under Rate Schedule T&hyph;11, a Transportation Agreement between
Northern and Midwest Gas dated March 21, 1973. ANR and Great Lakes are requesting permission and approval to abandon
an associated storage and transportation service that was also authorized in Docket No. CP73&hyph;282, and is provided
under a Transportation and Storage Agreement also dated March 21, 1973 under ANR's Rate Schedule X&hyph;36 and Great
Lakes' Rate Schedule X&hyph;4.

It is stated that Northern has been notified of Midwest Gas' intent to assign its interest in the 1973 Agreement to Minnegasco,
a division of Arkla, Inc. (Minnegasco). It is further stated that as a result of a property Exchange Agreement between
Minnegasco and Midwest Gas, that Minnegasco agreed to acquire Midwest Gas' Minnesota service territories. It is
averred that since the service associated with the 1973 Agreement is primarily to serve customers only in Minnesota,
Midwest Gas no longer has any incentive to maintain the 1973 Agreement after the transfer of its Minnesota distribution
facilities to Minnegasco.

Take notice that on June 7, 1994, Columbia LNG Corporation (Columbia LNG) and Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership (Cove
Point LNG) filed an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;717f(c), and
subpart A of Part 157 of the Commission's regulations, 18 CFR 157.5, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1993). Columbia LNG requests authorization to (i) add a new point of delivery for Washington Gas Light Company (Washington);
and (ii) construct and operate a new 12-inch tap at White Plains, Charles County, Maryland from which gas will be delivered
to Washington. Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG request expeditious consideration of their application due to an urgent
request from Washington to have the tap in place by the up-coming winter heating season to avoid the kind of pressure-related
difficulties experienced by Washington on its southern Maryland system during the severe weather last winter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG request that the Commission act upon the application independently of the applications
filed by Columbia LNG in Docket No. CP94&hyph;57&hyph;000, as amended, and Cove Point LNG in Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000,
as amended. Columbia LNG has an application pending in Docket No. CP94&hyph;57&hyph;000, as amended, in which it
is seeking authorization to abandon its facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction and to transfer those
facilities to Cove Point LNG. Cove Point LNG has an application pending in Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000, as amended,
in which Cove Point LNG is, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, seeking authorization (i) to acquire Columbia LNG's facilities; (ii) for a blanket construction certificate;
and (iii) to provide firm peaking services and firm and interruptible transportation on an open access and non-discriminatory
basis under subpart G of Part 284 of the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that Commission action in this proceeding occurs after acceptance of a certificate by Cove Point LNG in
Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000 and the transfer of the facilities to Cove Point LNG, Columbia LNG and Cove Point
LNG request that the authorization granted in this proceeding be issued to Cove Point LNG or in the alternative, be
freely transferable by Columbia LNG to Cove Point LNG. Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG state that Cove Point LNG is a
party to this proceeding in order to facilitate this request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before July 5, 1994,

(1993)) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10 (1993)). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered

Cowles Publishing Company (Cowles) filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the DOE's Richland Operations Office
of a Request for Information which the firm had submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (the FOIA). In considering
the Appeal, the DOE found that it was unable to render a determination on the threshold issue of whether the withheld
documents constituted ``agency records'' for purposes of the FOIA. Accordingly, the DOE remanded the matter to the
Richland Operations Office with instructions to investigate and review the matter further and to consider several
relevant inquiries raised by Cowles on Appeal.

Marbob Energy Corporation (Marbob) filed an Application for Exception from the requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;23,
the ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves.'' Marbob claimed that it lacked the necessary technical personnel
to provide the information requested in Form EIA&hyph;23. In considering the request, the DOE found that there were
no technical personnel required to complete the form other than those already employed by Marbob. The DOE also concluded
that the firm was not suffering a serious hardship and was not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a
way that was significantly different from the burden borne by similar reporting firms. Therefore, the DOE denied
Marbob's Application for Exception.

Ward Oil Co. (Ward) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) reporting requirements which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers'
Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the request, the DOE found that the firm was suffering a
gross inequity due to the long illness and death of the firm's office manager. Accordingly, the DOE determined that
the exception request be granted in part and that Ward should be removed from the survey from March 1994 through December
1994.

DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning six Applications for Refund filed in the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)
special refund proceeding. The DOE determined that the refund claims be denied, because the individual who filed
the Applications, Nic Schnettler, admitted that they were fraudulent. After pleading guilty to mail fraud, Mr. Schnettler
was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay $7,000 in restitution by the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois. Although the ARCO proceeding was closed on December 3, 1993, five of the six Applicants
were given thirty days from the date of the Decision to file Applications on their own in the ARCO proceeding. The other
Applicant has an Application pending.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI) in the
Gulf Oil Corp. special refund proceeding on behalf of New York Telephone Company (NYT). RRI, in filing the Motion,
requested that the DOE reverse its earlier decisions dismissing NYT's Application for Refund because it was filed
after the final filing deadline in the Gulf Oil Corp. special refund proceeding. RRI further alleged that certain
staff members of the DOE were prejudiced against RRI and that the prejudice influenced the DOE's decision to dismiss
NYT's Application for Refund and deny NYT's first Motion for Reconsideration. The DOE, as a discretionary matter,
reviewed the Motion and determined that it should be denied. The DOE found that RRI had presented no new information
or compelling reason that warranted reversing the previous decisions. The DOE also found RRI's allegations of bias
to be unfounded.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting seven Applications for Refund filed in the crude oil refund proceeding.
This Decision and Order incorporated simplified language as part of an ongoing attempt to improve service to the DOE's
stakeholders and customers. With respect to one application, the DOE noted that the applicant had included purchases
of asphalt concrete. The DOE held that asphalt concrete did not qualify as a covered product and therefore reduced
the applicant's gallonage to reflect the exclusion of asphalt concrete.

The State of Indiana filed a Motion for Modification of a previously-approved second-stage refund plan. The Motion,
if granted, would allow the State to use $123,750 of Amoco monies to fund its Fuel Saver Van Program. Under Indiana's
proposal, up to three vans containing automobile diagnostic equipment will travel to thirty cities in the State of
Indiana. The equipment in the vans will be used to inspect motorists' vehicles free of charge. Once an analysis is completed,
each motorist will be given a detailed description of all items inspected and their condition. The analyses will focus
on problems affecting excess gasoline consumption and vehicle emissions. The State predicts that the Program will
help injured consumers improve the energy efficiency of their automobiles and save them money by reducing the amount
of fuel they consume. The $123,750 that Indiana proposes to use for this program has not previously been allocated
to another program. However, since Indiana had not been reflecting in its oil overcharge account all of the interest
earned on Amoco monies previously transferred to it, the State itself has supplied $123,750 which would have been
the total amount of interest earned on Amoco monies received by the State, but was not previously posted to its account.
The DOE has previously approved funds for state support of the Fuel Saver Van Program. Accordingly, the Motion for
Modification was granted.

LK, Inc. filed an Application for Refund on behalf of First Interstate Bank of Texas (First Interstate), requesting
a refund based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products made by J.H. Rose Truck Line (Rose). The Application stated
that First Interstate was a secured creditor in Rose's bankruptcy proceeding. In considering this request, the DOE
found that First Interstate had not demonstrated that it had a clear and undisputed right to Rose's Texaco refund.
Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order denying the Application for Refund filed on behalf of First Interstate.

LK, Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision and Order that had denied its Application for Refund in the
Texaco refund proceeding with respect to purchases made by M &amp; M Transportation Company (M&amp;M), a bankrupt
firm. The DOE determined that the Motion did not present any compelling reason to reconsider the earlier decision.
Specifically, the DOE found that the purported assignment of M&amp;M's right to a Texaco refund to LK in the course
of the bankruptcy proceeding did not meet the strict standard adopted for approving such assignments in the precedential
case of Gulf Oil Corp./Spector Red Ball, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23 DOE &para;85,011 (1993). The DOE further found that there was no reason for applying a more lenient standard in this
case since the assignment did not expressly convey the right to apply for a product refund in the Texaco proceeding
and LK's payment to M&amp;M was unconscionably low. Accordingly, LK's motion was denied.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refund filed on behalf of two indirect purchasers,
Mike's Texaco on Henry and Kevin's Texaco, in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Each applicant stated that
it had no records from which to determine the number of gallons of Texaco products it purchased during the consent order
period and submitted estimated figures obtained from a chart labelled ``Information compiled from the National
Petroleum News Fact Book'' (Chart). The DOE rejected the use of the Chart in estimating the applicant's gallonage
figures because it failed to differentiate between different types of retailers and because the Chart defied established
historical trends in petroleum sales during the consent order period. Because neither applicant could establish
the volumes of Texaco products it purchased during the consent order period, the DOE determined that granting the
applicants a refund would not constitute restitution for Texaco's alleged overcharges. Consequently, the DOE denied
the Applications for Refund.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund to Tiger Oil Company (Tiger), an oil drilling contractor, in the
Subpart V crude oil overcharge refund proceeding. The application was submitted by Edward Mike Davis, owner of Tiger,
through Federal Refunds, Inc. (FRI), a private filing service. In the application, FRI estimated that Tiger purchased
204,529,860 gallons of refined petroleum products during the crude oil price control period. Neither Davis nor FRI
submitted any documentation to support this estimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOE later learned that Tiger is the subject of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. The DOE contacted the trustee
in bankruptcy, who had Tiger's records examined by two petroleum engineers. The petroleum engineers calculated
from the records that Tiger purchased 18,729,672 gallons of refined petroleum products during the price control
period. The DOE adjusted Tiger's gallonage claim in accordance with the petroleum engineers' estimate, and directed
the refund check to the trustee to provide appropriate restitution to Tiger. In addition, the DOE denied a motion by
a group of States and Territories, which argued that Tiger had passed the crude oil overcharges onto its customers.
The total volume approved in the Decision and Order is 18,729,672 gallons, and the total refund amount granted is $14,984.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Recipient Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Implement a research protocol jointly developed with CDC for the study of hospitalization for TB. This study will
be a prospective study of hospitalization of TB patients. The subjects will be all the incident cases of TB entered
in the TB case register during a period of six consecutive months, or the first 200 cases entered in the register from
the beginning of the study period, whichever comes first. The grantee will be responsible for appointing someone
with public health experience, (e.g., public health advisor, nurse, medical student) to enroll the patients in the
study and gather the following information: (1) determine if and when the hospitalization took place, (2) establish
contact with hospital clerks to facilitate abstraction of hospital records, (3) obtain informed consent and/or
release of record information forms, if applicable, and (4) complete a data extraction form for each patient. CDC
will provide training on uniform data collection procedures to be employed in the protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum of 80% of the patients enrolled in the study should be followed for a period of 1 year after their enrollment
or until completion of treatment, whichever comes first. All of the patient's hospitalizations during that period
should be documented. Data to be collected on enrollment include: (a) age, (b) sex, (c) race/ethnicity, (d) country
of origin, (e) history of substance abuse, (f) anatomic site of TB disease, (g) HIV serostatus, (h) income, and (i)
housing status. Data to be collected for each hospitalization include: (a) admission date, (b) admission diagnoses,
(c) indications for hospitalization, (d) type of hospital, (e) days in acid-fast bacillus (AFB) isolation, (f) discharge
date, (g) discharge diagnoses, (h) reasons for extended length of stay (if applicable), (i) patient disposition
upon discharge, (j) hospital charges, (k) charges per service, including isolation, and (l) third party payer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop procedures to adequately monitor patient enrollment and follow-up, data collection, and data management.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Develop and implement a quality assurance plan to monitor the effectiveness of protocol implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Recipient Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Conduct a tuberculin skin test (TST) program for health department personnel with direct patient contact or contract
with a hospital to perform tuberculin skin testing of hospital employees. If contracting with a hospital, the hospital
should have reported at least 50 cases of TB within the preceding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting the program the applicant will perform skin testing at one or more health department facilities or hospitals
where health care workers (HCWs) are potentially exposed to TB. Where employees have been exposed, the applicant
will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Perform contact investigations of HCWs exposed to an infectious TB patient who was not recognized and appropriately
isolated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Collect information on the circumstances surrounding these HCW exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Initiate appropriate TST for exposed HCWs, including baseline and follow-up testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Clinically evaluate all employees with a TST conversion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant in performing the TST program for employees on a routine basis will be required to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Use a two-step Mantoux test for all initial tests to minimize the likelihood of interpreting a boosted reaction
as a true conversion due to recent infection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Place and read a TB skin test on all HCWs. This will include measures or incentives likely to enhance workers' compliance
with such testing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Perform subsequent Mantoux testing annually (or more frequently if appropriate for the level of risk in the occupational
group or facility) of all employees whose initial skin tests were negative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Directly observe the reading of the TB skin test (in mm of induration) by personnel trained in correct placement
and reading of Mantoux skin tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Confidentially assess potential pertinent demographic factors, (such as, sex, race/ethnicity, country of
birth, and history of receipt of Bacille Calmette-Guerin) and occupational factors, (such as, occupation and worksite)
which may place HCWs at risk for TB exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Pilot CDC-developed software to assist in the collection, tracking, management, and analysis of data from tuberculin
skin testing programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Follow CDC guidelines for tuberculin skin testing. A copy of the guidelines will be included in the application
kit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Implement a research protocol jointly developed with CDC for the TST demonstration project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Use CDC-developed skin test software to enter all tuberculin skin test information onto the software and send a
diskette of the database to CDC on a monthly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Develop forms appropriate to their sites for the collection of data including HCW's demographics, occupational
information, tuberculin skin test information, and results of follow-up clinical evaluations for persons with
reactive skin tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The guideline entitled ``Guideline for the Evaluation of the Utility of Food Additives in Diets Fed to Aquatic Animals''
was developed for use by the aquaculture industry in conducting studies intended to evaluate the effectiveness of
food additives. The guideline provides guidance to manufacturers and scientists in the design and execution of utility
studies which are a required component of the food additive petition under 21 CFR 571.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This guideline provides considerations for protocol development; recordkeeping; analytical assays for food additives;
nutritional content and preparation of experimental diets; physical characteristics of diets; general experimental
procedures; experimental design; and investigator reports for laboratory and field trials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines state practices or procedures that may be useful but are not legal requirements. The guideline represents
the agency's position at the time of issuance. A person may follow the guideline or may choose to follow alternate practices
or procedures. If a person chooses to use alternate practices or procedures, that person may wish to discuss the matter
further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to
be unacceptable to FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on
any person. When a guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law
and its force and effect are not in any way changed by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, at any time, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on
the guideline. FDA will consider these comments in determining whether further amendments to, or revisions of, the
document are warranted. Two copies of any comments should be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy,
identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received comments
may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Over the past three years a new drug, called methcathinone, has appeared in the illicit drug market in the United States.
Results of animals studies indicate that this drug is a central nervous system stimulant with a significant potential
of abuse. This is supported by the anecdotal information that has been collected on its pattern of abuse, by the effects
produced and by the documented spread of abuse of the drug in the United States. On 1 May 1993, methcathinone was placed
in Schedule I of the United States Controlled Substances Act (the CSA). The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
is now aware that methcathinone is a drug of abuse in a number of other countries, particularly the Russian Federation
and some of the newly independent States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Methcathinone
is not currently scheduled at an International level. Considering that methcathinone abuse has been documented
in a number of countries, this drug should be examined for possible international control under the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971

Methcathinone is a structural analogue of cathinone and methamphetamine. The similarity in chemical structure
between methcathinone and the other two compounds is shown in the figure below. Methcathinone differs from cathinone
in having a methyl group in place of hydrogen attached to the terminal nitrogen atom of the isopropylamine side chain.
Methcathinone differs from methamphetamine in having a ketone group instead of a methylene group at the beta carbon
position of the phenylalkylamine molecule. All forms of methamphetamine have been controlled in Schedule II of CSA
since 1971. Cathinone was placed in Schedule I of the CSA on 14 January 1993. Cathinone and methamphetamine are currently
in Schedules I and II, respectively, of the 1971 Convention.

NO. The molecular weight of methcathinone hydrochloride is 199.67.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preclinical studies, methcathinone hydrochloride produces pharmacological effects and appears to have an abuse
potential similar to that of the amphetamines. Methcathinone hydrochloride increases spontaneous rodent locomotor
activity, potentiates the release of radio-labelled dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, and
causes appetite suppression. In drug discrimination studies, methcathinone hydrochloride evokes responses similar
to those induced by both (+)-amphetamine sulphate and cocaine hydrochloride. When examined in particular pharmacological
assays for psychomotor stimulant-like activity, both the d and l enantiomeric forms of methcathinone hydrochloride
have been found to be pharmacologically active. In these assays, the l-form of methcathinone is more active than either
d-methcathinone or (+)-amphetamine. Racemic methcathinone hydrochloride is intravenously self-administered
by baboons, thus indicating that methcathinone produces reinforcing effects in this laboratory animal, and suggesting
that the drug has a potential for abuse in the human population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A survey of the scientific and medical literature has not revealed any studies examining the pharmacological effects
of methcathinone in humans. Parke Davis, who initially did preclinical studies of methcathinone in the United States
in the early and mid-1950s, subsequently elected to abandon the drug prior to performing any clinical studies. Methcathinone
has never been approved for legitimate medical use in the United States. Currently, DEA is not aware of any legitimate
medical uses for methcathinone in other countries. The limited knowledge of the pharmacology of methcathinone in
humans comes from anecdotal evidence of methcathinone abuse and from several papers published in journals in the
Russian Federation and documenting methcathinone (ephedrone) abuse in that country. This information indicates
that in humans methcathinone produces stimulant effects on the central nervous system similar to those produce by
amphetamines and cocaine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the abuse of methcathinone has been documented in Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri.
This abuse is believed to have originated at Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1989. Since then, methcathinone abuse in Michigan
has increased substantially, almost exclusively in the Upper Peninsula of that state. Methcathinone abuse spread
from Michigan into Wisconsin sometime in late 1992. A number of drug abuse treatment centres in Michigan, as well as
several drug and psychiatric treatment centres in Wisconsin, have reported encounters with methcathinone abusers.
In addition, there have been a number of documented emergency-room cases involving the purported abuse of methcathinone.
Data from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies indicate methcathinone abuse in Michigan and Wisconsin,
which subsequently spread to Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. Individuals abusing methcathinone have been primarily
whites with limited educational backgrounds and financial means. In addition, they tend to be polysubstance abusers,
having abuse experience with alcohol, marijuana, stimulants (that is, methamphetamine and cocaine) and/or other
drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal form of methcathinone distributed and abused is the hydrochloride salt of the l-enantiomer, which
exists as a chunky powdered material, white to off-white in colour. It is usually sold as itself under such street names
as ``Cat'' and ``Goob''. Less often it is passed off as methamphetamine under such names as ``Crank'', ``Speed'',
``Slick Superspeed'', ``Bathtub speed'' and ``Cadillac Express''. It is usually sold in quantities of one fourth
of a gram, 1 gram, 3.5 grams (``8-ball'') or an ounce (28.35 grams). The powdered material comes packaged in paper packets
(called bindles), vials and plastic bags. Street prices are in the vicinity of 20.00 United States dollars (US$) to
US$ 25.00 for one fourth of a gram, US$ 100.00 for 1 gram, and US$ 200 to US$ 250.00 for an ``8-ball''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anecdotal reports have provided some information on patterns of methcathinone abuse. The most common route of administration
is via nasal insufflation (snorting). Other routes of administration include oral ingestion, intravenous injection
and smoking. Methcathinone is abused in binges lasting two to six days. During binges experienced users will administer
methcathinone at doses ranging from one sixteenth to one fourth or a gram. The interval between dosing varies between
approximately 20 minutes and two hours. With such a dosing regimen, during a binge methcathinone may be administered
in daily amounts exceeding 1 or 2 grams. The principal determinant defining the length of the binge is the amount of
drug available; that is, the binge ends only when the available supply of drug runs out. The methcathinone binge resembles
amphetamine binges in that the abuser does not sleep or eat, and takes in little in the way of liquids. The methcathinone
binge is followed by a ``crash'' characterized by long periods of sleep, excess eating and, in some cases, depression
with or without thoughts of suicide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methcathinone is abused for its psychomotor stimulant effects. It is reported by abusers to produce such desirable
effects as a ``burst of energy'', ``head rush'', ``body rush'', a ``speeding of the mind'', and ``increased feeling
of self-confidence'' and ``euphoria''. Methcathinone abusers with experience in the abuse of other stimulants
have reported that the effects produced by methcathinone are qualitatively similar to those produced by methamphetamine
and/or cocaine. The head rush and body rush are much more intense following intravenous administration than snorting.
The onset of action has been reported to occur around one to two minutes following intravenous injection and 5 to 15
minutes following snorting. Duration of action may vary from 30 minutes to about two hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methcathinone abuse is associated with the production of adverse effects. Abusers have anecdotally reported that
methcathinone produces unpleasant effects such as paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety, tremor, insomnia, malnutrition,
weight loss, dehydration, sweating, stomach pains, nose-bleeding and body aches. At least four emergency-room
encounters with presumed methcathinone abusers have been documented in Michigan. In three of these cases, intravenous
administration was the route of administration. In the other case, the drug was smoked. Adverse effects observed
in one or more of the four cases included agitation, excitement, hallucinations, elevated temperature, chills,
elevated blood temperature, increased heart rate, tremor, back and/or abdominal pain and hypotension. All effects
subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Complete recovery occurred in all four cases. In these cases, methcathinone use was
presumed to be based upon the descriptions of drug use given by the patients. In the absence of an established analytical
procedure to measure methcathinone levels in biological fluids, analysis of methcathinone in fluid samples from
the cases was not attempted. In two of the cases ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine, known metabolites of methcathinone,
were detected in urine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methcathinone hydrochloride is produced for street distribution in clandestine laboratories. Between June 1991
and August 1993, 27 active or inactive clandestine methcathinone laboratories were seized by federal, state and
local law enforcement officials in Michigan. Since January 1993, at least five clandestine methcathinone laboratories
have been encountered in Wisconsin. In August 1992 a clandestine methcathinone laboratory was seized in Seattle,
Washington. In June 1993 a clandestine methcathinone laboratory was seized in Illinois. In September 1993 four clandestine
methcathinone laboratories were seized in Indiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the United States, methcathinone is synthesized via the oxidation of l-ephedrine using sodium dichromate and
sulphuric acid. Once this reaction is completed (in about four hours), the solution is made basic using a suitable
base such as lye. The methcathinone is then extracted from the basic solution using toluene which has previously been
dried using Epsom salt. In the next step, hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the organic solution to precipitate
out the l-methcathinone hydrochloride salt. Following removal of the solvents, the l-methcathinone hydrochloride
exists as a chunky powder, white to off-white in colour. Recently, some clandestine laboratory operators, as a final
step, have started washing the methcathinone hydrochloride powder with acetone in order to further remove impurities
to make the powder more white in colour. As the hydrochloride salt form, l-methcathinone is very stable and readily
water-soluble. To date almost all of the ephedrine used in clandestine laboratories has come from the 25-milligram
l-ephedrine tablets purchased from pharmaceutical warehouses. Sodium dichromate is readily obtained from most
chemical supply stores. The sulphuric acid is primarily obtained as battery acid from automotive stores. Lye, toluene,
acetone and muriatic acid (a solution of hydrochloric acid) are obtained form hardware stores. The synthesis of l-methcathinone
hydrochloride does not require any special reaction conditions or laboratory equipment. Laboratory equipment
typically consists of mason jars, funnels, coffee filters, tubing and a stirring apparatus.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methcathinone has been encountered by law enforcement officials in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, North
Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin. Michigan State Police obtained the first street sample of methcathinone in
February 1991. Since that time, there have been over 75 encounters of methcathinone by federal, state and local law
enforcement officials in Michigan. Methcathinone was first encountered in Wisconsin in March 1992. Since October
1992, there have been more than 30 federal, state or local law enforcement encounters of methcathinone in Wisconsin.
A number of encounters have occurred in Indiana and Missouri. Isolated encouters have been documented in Washington,
North Carolina and Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The abuse and illicit trafficking of methcathinone has also been reported in several other countries. In the Report
of the International Narcotics Control Board for 1992
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
, some States of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are mentioned as locations of methcathinone production
from ephedrine principally extracted from pharmaceutical preparations. The report also noted that in some central
Asian States such as Kyrgyzstan, ephedrine for making methcathinone is extracted from the wild-growing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 species. In a 1992 report of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme on a fact-finding mission to
some of the CIS States, methcathinone abuse was reported in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and the Russian Federation. In
the report, it was noted that in Kyrgyzstan the abuse of methcathinone was spreading, and that 21 illicit laboratories
for the conversion of ephedrine into methcathinone had been detected. Ephedrine derived from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 was mentioned as being used to make methcathinone in Kazakhstan. In a report on a separate mission to the Baltic States
in 1992, methcathinone was specifically mentioned as a drug of abuse in Latvia. In addition, ``ephedrine-based''
drugs (believed to be methcathinone) were identified as an abuse problem in Estonia and Lithuania.

Some information is available on the production and abuse of methcathinone, known as ephedrone, in the Russian Federation.
According to a report of the Ministry of the Interior All-Union Scientific Research Institute of the former USSR,
ephedrone surfaced for the first time at Leningrad in 1982. Subsequently, ephedrone abuse increased substantially
among drug addicts who referred to ephedrone under such street names as ``Jeff'', ``Joe Cocktail'', ``Mul'ka'',
``Cosmos'', ``Effendi'' and ``Pomimutka''. In the Russian Federation, ephedrone is usually made by the oxidation
of ephedrine obtained primarily from medicinal preparations and, less often, form the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ephedra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 plant. Ephedrine is oxidized by potassium permanganate (not sodium dichromate) in the presence of acetic acid (vinegar)
and at temperatures of 50 to 60 degrees centigrade. No attempt is made to isolate the ephedrone in pure form. Instead,
the entire solution, containing ephedrine, potassium permanganate and acetic acid, is intravenously injected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Russia Federation, ephedrone abuse is mostly found among young people having a history of stimulant or opiate
abuse. Intravenous injection is the primary route of administration. As in the United States, the principal pattern
of abuse is the binge lasting two to seven days. During a binge, ephedrone is repeatedly injected starting out at doses
of 2 to 3 millilitres and escalating to 5 or 10 millilitres at a time. The interval between injections are in the range
of 30 minutes to 2 hours. During the binge, daily cumulative doses may reach 100 to 150 millilitres of injectable ephedrone
solution. The binge is further characterized by lack of food intake and ultimately by physical and mental exhaustion.
The binge is followed by a withdrawal period characterized by prolonged periods of sleep, irritability, hot-tempered
fits, weakness, general psychic discomfort, suppression of mood and depression.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ephedrone injection results in a ``high'' lasting 15 to 20 minutes followed by euphoria and a ``craving for activity'',
feelings of lightness, cheerfulness, fresh surges of energy, ``clearness of the head'' and improved mood. Somatic
symtoms observed following injection include accelerated heart rate, increased arterial pressure, dilated pupils,
nystagmus and pain of the supraorbital points. Prolonged use of ephedrone is associated with the appearance of psychotic
states. Paranoia is commonly observed. Both auditory and visual hallucinations may also be experienced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination of ephedrone drug addicts in the Russian Federation have revealed the following characteristics: drastic
weight loss; acne vulgaris in the face, back, chest, shoulders, forearms and feet; ``paths'' of pigmentation with
sclerosal veins; acrocyanosis; swelling of the hands; a waxen complexion; red tongue; and enlarged liver. Often
addicts have potassium manganate burns on their fingers. Addicts tend not to pay attention to their appearance, thus
looking ragged with dirty hands and hair. Neurological examination of ephedrone addicts reveal lateral nystagmus,
increased tendon periosteal reflexes, staggering in Romberg's posture and a fine tremor of the fingers of extended
hands.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aminorex and methcathinone are stimulants that are controlled domestically in Schedule I of the CSA. Neither substance
has been approved for use in the treatment of any medical condition in this country and neither substance is controlled
internationally. Etryptamine is currently controlled in Schedule I domestically, under the temporary scheduling
provisions of the CSA. Etryptamine has not been approved for medical use in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triazolam and flunitrazepam are controlled domestically and internationally in Schedule IV of the CSA and the Convention.
Triazolam is approved for medical use in the United States, flunitrazepam is not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brotizolam, mesocarb, and zipeprol are not controlled domestically or internationally, nor approved for use in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Opportunity to Submit Domestic Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by section 201(d)(2)(A) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(d)(2)(A)), FDA on behalf of HHS invites interested persons
to submit data or comments regarding the eight named drugs. Data and information received in response to this notice
will be used to prepare scientific and medical information on these drugs, with a particular focus on each drug's abuse
liability. HHS will forward that information to WHO, through the Secretary of State, for WHO's consideration in deciding
whether to recommend international control of any of these drugs. Such control could limit, among other things, the
manufacture and distribution (import/export) of these drugs, and could impose certain recordkeeping requirements
on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, HHS will not make any recommendations to WHO regarding whether any of these drugs should be subjected
to international controls. Instead, HHS will defer such consideration until WHO has made official recommendations
to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which are expected to be made in late 1994 or early 1995. Any HHS position regarding
international control of these drugs will be preceded by another 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice soliciting public comment as required by section 201(d)(2)(B) of the CSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before July 20, 1994, submit to the Docket Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m, Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This abbreviated acceptance period is necessary to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit the domestic information
package by the deadline imposed by WHO. Although WHO has requested comments and information by June 15, 1994, WHO will
accept and consider material transmitted after June 15, 1994. Respondents should submit material in the format set
forth by the WHO Questionnaire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This notice contains information collection requirements that were submitted for review and approval to the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
The requirements were approved and assigned OMB control number 0910&hyph;0226.

Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SDS program is a program of grants to health professions and nursing schools for the purpose of assisting such schools
in providing scholarships to individuals from disadvantaged background who are enrolled (or accepted for enrollment)
as full-time students in the schools, as well as to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing
a career in health professions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the SDS program in FY 1994, an ``individual from disadvantaged backgrounds'' is defined in 42 CFR part
57.1804, subpart S, as one who:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Comes from an environment that has inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skill, and abilities
required to enroll in and graduate from a health professions school, or from a program providing education or training
in allied health professions; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Comes from a family with an annual income below a level based low-income thresholds according to family size published
by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary
for use in all health professions and nursing programs. The Secretary will periodically publish these low-income
levels in the

Methodology for Implementing the Statutory Special Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the statute, in making awards under section 737(a), the Secretary shall give special consideration
to eligible schools that have enrollments of underrepresented minorities above the national average for its particular
discipline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining eligibility of a school, Asians will not be included in the definition of underrepresented
minorities for the school. Although certain Asian subgroups (i.e., Filipinos, Koreans, Pacific Islanders, and
Southeast Asians) are considered to be underrepresented in the health professions and are included as minorities
for purposes of program requirements relating to faculty recruitment and retention (see above), national data on
these subgroups are not available as a basis for establishing national average enrollment of underrepresented minorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the FY 1994 award cycle, the national average enrollments, of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans
(in combination) are: for medicine 13.3 percent; osteopathic medicine 7.7 percent; nursing (RN only) 12.2 percent;
dentistry 13.4 percent; pharmacy 10.6 percent; optometry 9.4 percent; podiatric medicine 17.9 percent; veterinary
medicine 5.9 percent; public health 15.7 percent; allied health 17.3 percent; and clinical psychology 13 percent.

Nonstatutory Special Consideration for Baccalaureate Nursing Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among schools of nursing, additional special consideration will be given to baccalaureate programs. One of the distinguishing
features of baccalaureate education is the substantial focus on preparation for community health practice. Training
nurses for community health practice is an integral component of the Department's access strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures for Calculating Awards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Awards to eligible schools which have applied will be calculated by comparing the enrollment of disadvantaged students
in each eligible school with the total enrollment of the disadvantaged students in all eligible schools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A school with an enrollment of underrepresented minority students which is above the national average (for each discipline)
will be given double credit (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
its enrollment of disadvantaged students would be doubled for awarding purposes). A baccalaureate nursing school
will be given double credit. A baccalaureate nursing school with an underrepresented minority enrollment above
the national average will be given quadruple credit (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
its enrollment of disadvantaged students will be multiplied by four for awarding purposes).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other funding factors may be applied in determining the funding of approved applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Funding Preferences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For fiscal year 1994, it is proposed that among allied health schools or programs, preference be given to the following
baccalaureate and graduate programs: dental hygiene, medical laboratory technology, occupational therapy, physical
therapy and radiologic technology. This proposal is in accordance with House Report No. 101&hyph;804, accompanying
the Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990, which recommended that funding be restricted to these
allied health professions programs. With over 3,000 accredited allied health programs, the SDS program focus would
be directed to those allied health professions with the greatest current or personnel shortages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is also proposed that preference be given to baccalaureate and graduate programs. Although programs
of study leading to the award of an associate degree or certificate are of significant value in educating allied health
personnel, the cost of education at the baccalaureate and graduate levels is substantially greater, and thus such
cost is a major deterrent to the recruitment and retention of disadvantaged individuals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program is authorized by Section 520 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (approved November 28, 1990,
Pub. L. 101&hyph;625). In general, Youth Sports Program funds may be used to assist in carrying out sports, cultural,
recreational, educational or other activities for youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A FY 1994 Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) for the above-described program was published on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24548).
The original notice provided 41 days_until June 20, 1994_for applications in response to the NOFA. The Department
has received numerous indications from prospective applicants that the allotted time for submitting applications
is too short to permit the preparation and presentation of the necessary materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these concerns, the Department is extending the deadline for submission of applications for the FY
1994 funding round. It is hoped that this extension of time will expand the number and the quality of applications that
HUD receives for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will now be due on or before 4:30 PM local time, on Wednesday, July 20, 1994. An original and two copies
of the application must be received by the deadline at the local HUD Field Office with jurisdiction over Public Housing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice advises the public that Shell Oil Company (Shell) and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
(MWD) (Applicants) have applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant
to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The application, which includes a
Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and an Implementation Agreement (IA), has been assigned permit number PRT&hyph;784571.
The requested permit would authorize the incidental take of the threatened California gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), on certain lands located within the sphere of influence of the City of Yorba Linda in unincorporated northern Orange
County, California. The HCP submitted in support of the permit application, also provides for the conservation of
the coastal cactus wren as if it were listed under the Act as a threatened or endangered species and, barring a determination
by the Service of unforeseen circumstances and compliance with applicable public review and comment requirements,
would support an amendment to the 10(a)(1)(B) permit to authorize the incidental take of that species should the cactus
wren be listed during the term of the permit. The proposed incidental take would occur as a result of grading and construction
activities for a residential development and municipal golf course in a depleted oilfield, and improvements to the
Diemer Water Treatment Facility. Both sites are occupied by the California gnatcatcher and coastal cactus wren.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed issuance of the
incidental take permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy
Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations, ``taking'' of a threatened or endangered species is prohibited.
However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take threatened or endangered wildlife
species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing
permits for threatened or endangered species are at Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations 17.32 and 17.22, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1993, the Service listed the coastal California gnatcatcher as a threatened species. On May 2, 1994, the
rule listing the gnatcatcher was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the basis
that the Secretary of the Interior failed to obtain and make available for public comment, the data underlying a published
scientific report on the subspecific taxonomy of the gnatcatcher. The Secretary has filed a motion for reconsideration
of the court's decision and, alternatively, a motion to stay the portion of the decision that vacated the listing while
the Service receives public comment on these data. These motions are currently pending before the court. The Service
is also reviewing several other options to provide the protection of the Act to the gnatcatcher. These options include
appealing the court's decision, listing the gnatcatcher on an emergency basis, and proposing a new rule to list the
gnatcatcher.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service announces the receipt and availability for public review and comment of this 10(a)(1)(B) permit application
in order to facilitate review and potential issuance of the incidental take permit should the coastal California
gnatcatcher return to the status of a federally listed species. The Service also seeks public review and comments
on the proposed signing of the IA by the Service. The IA would obligate the Applicants to carry out the provisions of
the HCP that provides for protection and conservation of the California gnatcatcher and cactus wren as if both species
were listed as threatened or endangered species under the Act. By signing the IA, the Service would certify to the Applicants
that, barring a determination of unforeseen circumstances, and subject to compliance with applicable public review
and comment requirements, the Service would expeditiously issue a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit to the Applicants
allowing incidental take of one or both species, as appropriate, if the California gnatcatcher or cactus wren are
listed as threatened or endangered species in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants propose to implement the HCP for the California gnatcatcher and coastal cactus wren to allow phased
oil field remediation and clearing, grading and construction of a residential development, golf course, elementary
school, and commercial development on a depleted oil field, and ongoing maintenance and facility modifications
on the Deimer Water Treatment Facility within the sphere of influence of the City of Yorba Linda, in unincorporated
Orange County, California. These activities would take place over a period of approximately 20 years. The permit
would authorize incidental take of gnatcathers associated with the destruction of up to 27 acres of occupied gnatcatcher
habitat. That habitat is estimated to support approximately 9 gnatcatchers. The IA executed by the parties would
also provide for future amendment of the permit to authorize incidental take of cactus wren should the cactus wrens
associated with the destruction of up to 83 acres of occupied cactus wren habitat be listed in the future as a threatened
or endangered species under the Act. It is estimated that up to 55 pairs of cactus wren occupy the development site.
The permit would be in effect for 50 years on the Shell property.

The Applicant proposes to mitigate for the incidental take by: (1) Dedicating 58 acres of on-site coastal sage scrub
(CSS) habitat to Chino Hills State Park; (2) placing a conservation easement on 20 acres of Walnut woodland on-site;
(3) preservation/restoration of an additional 64 acres of habitat within the golf course which has been designed
to provide a buffer between wildlands and development; (4) operation of 12&hyph;15 cowbird traps in perpetuity;
(5) a discounted sale, to the State of California, of 979 acres of multispecies habitat to be managed to promote conservation
of the gnatcatcher and cactus wren, including 572 acres of CSS, 48 acres of oak woodland, and 237 acres of chaparral;
(6) providing for the restoration of approximately 27 acres of CSS and cactus in the purchase area and in adjacent Chino
Hills State Park; (7) funding a State Park ecologist for 15 years (10 years full time), who will oversee offsite restoration,
conduct the cowbird trapping program, conduct sensitive species surveys, patrol the area for vagrants, conduct
a community education and involvement program, and prepare a long-term fire management program; (8) creating a fire
suppression compartment in cooperation with State Parks and the Orange County Fire Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA considers the environmental consequences of several alternatives, including the proposed action, no-take,
and no-action alternatives. The proposed action is (1) the issuance of a permit under section 10(a) of the Act that,
in conjunction with oil field remediation, residential and golf course development, and maintenance and improvement
activities at the Diemer Water Filtration Plant, would authorize the incidental take of gnatcatchers associated
with the removal of 27 acres of occupied California gnatcatcher habitat, and (2) the execution of the IA by the Service
that, barring unforeseen circumstances, would provide for the amendment of the permit to authorize the incidental
take of cactus wrens associated with the removal of up to 83 acres of occupied cactus wren habitat should the cactus
wren be listed in the future as a threatened or endangered species under the Act. The proposed action would result in
minimizing incidental take by placing limitations on and monitoring proposed construction and remediation activities.
Mitigation under the proposed action would enhance California gnatcatcher and cactus wren conservation through
the acquisition, restoration, and management of 1126 acres of habitat important for the conservation of the California
gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and other sensitive and declining species. Under the no-take alternative, the permit
would not be issued, Shell oil field remediation and project potentially would not occur, and MWD potentially would
not be allowed to maintain the structural integrity of its facility. In addition to presenting public health and safety
problems, no restoration or management would occur, and the existing habitat will remain vulnerable to fire and unregulated
use. Under the no-project alternative, oil field remediation would occur without subsequent development. Additionally,
an alternative including both residential and commercial development, but without the golf course was considered.
Analysis of other alternatives included oil field remediation, but with the residential, commercial, and golf course
developments being located elsewhere.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Coastal barriers are unique landforms which provide protection for diverse aquatic habitats and serve as the mainland's
first line of defense against the impacts of coastal storms and erosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress recognized the vulnerability of coastal barriers to development by passing the Coastal Barriers Resource
Act in 1982 (CBRA). CBRA (Public Law 97&hyph;348) established the Coastal Barriers Resources System (System) that
prohibits all new Federal expenditures and financial assistance within the units of that system unless specifically
excepted by the CBRA. This action was taken because Federal expenditures and financial assistance have the effect
of encouraging development of coastal barriers. By restricting these Federal expenditures, Congress intended
to minimize the loss of human life, wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and damage to fish, wildlife, and other
natural resources associated with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Congress passed the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act (CBIA). The CBIA (Public Law 101&hyph;591) tripled
the size of the system by adding coastal barriers of the Great Lakes as well as additional areas along the Atlantic and
Gulf of Mexico coasts. The coastal barrier system currently includes 560 units, comprising almost 1.3 million acres
and about 1,200 shoreline miles. The CBIA also directed the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to prepare a study
which examines the need for protecting undeveloped coastal barriers along the Pacific coast of the United States
south of 49 degrees north latitude through inclusion in the system. This area includes the States of California, Hawaii,
Oregon, and Washington; American Samoa; Guam; the Northern Marianas; and all other Pacific Ocean territories and
possessions of the United States. In addition, the Secretary was directed to prepare maps identifying the boundaries
of undeveloped coastal barriers within this area. The Secretary delegated the authority to develop the Study and
accompanying maps of undeveloped coastal barriers of the Pacific Coast to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).

to address any technical errors noted during the comment period. The revised draft maps, and all comments received,
were forwarded to appropriate State Governors for their review and use in formulation of recommendations as to which
State areas should be included in the System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FWS developed the required Draft Study and revised draft maps of areas under consideration for inclusion in the
Coastal Barrier Resources System in 1993. The FWS made the Draft Study and maps available for a 60 day public review
and comment period on December 17, 1993 (58 F.R. 66016). Appropriate State Governors were afforded an additional
30 days for review and comment. On February 23, 1994, the FWS extended the public comment period until March 25, 1994,
and for appropriate State Governors until April 25, 1994. Between January 5, 1994, and January 18, 1994, a total of
15 public meetings were held in Oregon, Washington, California, and Hawaii regarding the draft study and accompanying
maps. Press releases were issued in all affected areas. Mailings of the draft maps and Study were provided to individuals
and central locations on FWS mailing lists, supplemented by mailing lists provided by State Coastal Zone Management
program managers. Announcements of availability of the maps and Study were also widely disseminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coastal barrier units which occur on Tribal lands were included on the 1991 draft maps but deleted from the 1993 study
maps at the request of the Tribal sovereign nations. Neither the CBRA nor the CBIA provide guidance regarding the inclusion
of Tribal lands in the System. However, inclusion of coastal barrier units which occur on Tribal lands in the System
would meet the purposes of the Act, particularly given the sensitive living resources associated with these areas.
Recognizing the sovereignty of the Native American nations, the Department of the Interior (Department) solicited
the input and recommendations from each affected Tribe during the formulation of the Draft Study. These Tribal recommendations
will be submitted to Congress with the Department's final Study recommendations or at a later date following appropriate
coordination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental review of the Draft Pacific Coastal Barriers Study and accompanying maps will be conducted by the
FWS in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371
et seq), other appropriate Federal regulations, and FWS procedures for compliance with those regulations. The Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) will be made available to the public for review and comment by Spring, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The focus of the environmental assessment (EA) is for the orderly termination and relocation of the Virginia Power
transmission corridor, which runs through the Brawner farm and Stuart's Hill tracts. These tracts are where the Second
Battle of Manassas erupted on August 28, 1862. Brawner farm and Stuart's Hill were incorporated into the park through
legislated boundary adjustments in 1980 and 1988, respectively. These two areas on the western edge of the park encompass
870 acres and are bordered on the south by Interstate 66, on the west by Pageland Lane, and on the east by Groveton Road.
U.S. Route 29 runs between the tracts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Manassas National Battlefield Park Amendments Act of 1988 (the Act), title X of P.L. 100&hyph;647 (16 U.S.C. 429b(b))
legislatively took possession of Virginia Power's easements, powerlines, and towers on the Stuart's Hill tract
at the park. The National Park Service has sought to define and analyze alternative alignments and has selected a preferred
alternative that relocates the facilities to the western most edge of the park. Relocation would stand as the method
and extent of compensation required by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA analyzes three alternatives for moving the power lines. It identifies the location and type of equipment needed
and assesses the impacts that power line relocation alternatives would have on the environment. This EA presents
the preferred alternative (alternative B), which proposes relocating the existing power line right-of-way within
the park boundary, and a no-action alternative that implements legislation to move the power lines completely outside
the park boundary (alternative C). This EA also includes an alternative that analyses conditions under which the
power lines might remain in their present alignment (alternative A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferred alternative would enhance interpretive experiences of the second battle by relocating the power lines
away from the historic core of the Brawner farm and Stuart's Hill tracts to a corridor just inside the western boundary
of the park.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsible official for a decision on the preferred alternative is Robert G. Stanton, Regional Director, National
Capital Region, National Park Service.

Grand Trunk Western Railroad Incorporated (GTW), successor to Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company, has filed a
verified notice under the rail class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7) to grant/assign trackage rights to Canadian
National Railway Company (CN) over 109.07 miles of line in Michigan. The exemption became effective on May 12, 1994.
The transaction was consummated May 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Commission's rules governing rail class exemptions, the exemption becomes effective 7 days after the verified
notice is filed. 49 CFR 1180.4(g)(1). The parties may consummate the underlying transaction on or after the exemption's
effective date. At 5 p.m. on May 27, 1994, United Transportation Union and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers filed
a petition to revoke the exemption and a motion to stay consummation of the transaction. The filing of a petition to
revoke will not stay the exemption's effectiveness. Because the labor organizations' petition was not filed until
after regular business hours on Friday, May 27, and because Monday, May 30, was a Federal holiday (Memorial Day), the
Commission was unable to act on the stay request before the transaction was consummated on May 31. The arguments of
the labor organizations will be addressed in the decision on the petition to revoke the exemption.

Yankee Atomic Electric Co., Yankee Nuclear Power Station, Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR &sect;140.11(a)(4) to Facility Operating License (Possession Only) No. DPR&hyph;3, issued to the Yankee
Atomic Electric Company (YAEC or the licensee), for the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or plant) located at the
licensee site in Franklin County, Massachusetts.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR &sect;140.11(a)(4) to the extent that
primary financial protection in the amount of $100 million (reduced from the current level of $200 million) shall
be maintained and an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial
protection) should be granted for the YNPS. The licensee requested an amendment to the facility Indemnity Agreement
No. B&hyph;17 in a letter dated September 28, 1992, as supplemented by letter dated January 19, 1993. However, the
staff has determined that an exemption to 10 CFR &sect;140.11(a)(4) is required before the licensee Indemnity Agreement
may be amended as provided by the proposed exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plant was permanently shut down on October 1, 1991, and defueled during February 1992. The NRC in license Amendment
No. 142, dated August 5, 1992, modified Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;3 to possession only status. The
license is conditioned so that YAEC is not authorized to operate or place fuel in the reactor vessel, thus formalizing
the licensee commitment to permanently cease power operations. The plant has not operated for more than two years
and eight months, and radioactive decay has significantly reduced the radioactive nuclide inventory and decay heat
of the spent fuel. Sufficient time has elapsed so as to significantly reduce the potential consequences of postulated
accidents, in view of the low density storage of the fuel in the pool. The proposed exemption addresses two areas for
relief of financial protection requirements: (1) a reduction in the primary financial protection coverage requirements
from $200 million to $100 million and (2) withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan
(secondary level). As the YNPS no longer contributes risk to the industry retrospective rating plan as an operating
plant, the reduction in risk associated with its current status should be reflected in the indemnification requirements
to which the licensee is subject. The issuance of this exemption would allow a more equitable allocation of financial
risk.

Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action does not involve any environmental impacts. The proposed exemption is in a subject area (changes
in surety, insurance and/or indemnity requirements) for which the Commission in 10 CFR &sect;51.22(c)(10) has determined
that a license amendment would meet the criteria for categorical exclusion from the need for either an environmental
assessment or an environmental impact statement. However, the Commission has nonetheless decided to prepare an
environmental assessment for this specific action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, (1) there is reasonable assurance
that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident or reduce the margin
of safety, (2) no changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluents that may be released offsite, and (3)
there would be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action.

Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed
action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the action. This would not reduce the environmental impacts associated
with the plant and would not enhance protection of the environment or public health and safety.

Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

On January 6, 1982, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as final, certain amendments to 10 CFR parts 71 and 73 (effective July 6, 1982), which require advance notification
to Governors or their designees concerning transportation of certain shipments of nuclear waste and spent fuel.
The advance notification covered in part 73 is for spent nuclear reactor fuel shipments and the notification for part
71 is for large quantity shipments of radioactive waste (and of spent nuclear reactor fuel not covered under the final
amendment to 10 CFR part 73).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following list updates the names, addresses and telephone numbers of those individuals in each State who are responsible
for receiving information on nuclear waste shipments. The list will be published annually in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that by Petition dated May 2, 1994, the Honorable Michael O. Leavitt, Governor of the State of
Utah, and the Utah Legislature (Petitioners) requested that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission take action
regarding Umetco Minerals, licensee of the White Mesa uranium mill facility near Blanding, Utah. Petitioners request
that the NRC modify the Umetco Minerals license to reflect the licensee's original request for authority to receive
5,000 cubic yards of in-situ waste at the White Mesa facility, rather than the 10,000 cubic yards authorized by a license
amendment granted by the NRC on August 2, 1993. Petitioners also request that the NRC confer with the State of Utah prior
to future license amendments and receive the concurrence of the Utah Legislature and Governor before approving future
license amendments involving mill tailing disposal in Utah. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners assert as the basis for this request that the NRC has in effect created the equivalent of a commercial waste
disposal facility for in-situ mining waste unlicensed by Utah, while ignoring Utah's waste policy and laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petition has been referred to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards pursuant to
10 CFR &sect;2.206. As provided by &sect;2.206, appropriate action will be taken on the specific issues raised by
the Petition in a reasonable time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In revising the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) in preparation for publishing Issue 46 on July 1, 1993, the Postal Service
identified many regulations and provisions that did not specifically govern the eligibility for and use of domestic
mail services, and made a determination not to include that material in DMM Issue 46. The identified regulations and
provisions chiefly fell into two categories: recommendations for voluntary customer action and internal instructions
to postal employees. Also identified were provisions not pertaining to domestic mail classification, such as post
office discontinuances, delivery policies, and philatelic procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pending the transfer of these regulations and provisions to other documents, the Postal Service published on July
1, 1993, the identified material in a separate part of the DMM titled the Domestic Mail Manual Transition Book. In creating
the Transition Book, the Postal Service provided that the material included therein remain in full force and effect
as DMM regulations and provisions for up to 1 year. 58 FR 34887 (June 30, 1993). Accordingly, the Transition Book was
published with an expiration date of June 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this 1-year period was to allow the Postal Service to make a thorough review of these regulations and
provisions and to decide whether to incorporate them into other documents, to publish them as mail classification
rulings, or to rescind them. As the following two tables show, several changes have been made to the Transition Book
since its publication; however, the evaluation process is not yet complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service has therefore determined to rescind the June 30, 1994, expiration date of the Transition Book.
Additional time will be required for an orderly and systematic transfer of the remaining material from the Transition
Book without jeopardizing maintenance of regulations and provisions necessary for the Postal Service and its customers.
As a result, the Transition Book will remain in effect until all remaining material has been transferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table I shows those sections of the Transition Book (DMMT) that have been removed since July 1, 1993, and, where applicable,
the sections of the Postal Operations Manual (POM) or title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) into which such
material was transferred. Effective dates shown also indicate publication dates in the Postal Bulletin or

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the CBOE's FLEX Option program is to provide a frame-work for the Exchange to list and trade index options
that give investors the ability, within specified limits, to designate certain of the terms of the options.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Such terms currently include the underlying index,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 type (put, call, or spread), exercise style (American, European, or European-Capped), expiration date,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 strike price, and form of settlement (a.m. settlement versus p.m. settlement).

The Commission approved the CBOE's FLEX Options framework on February 24, 1993, permitting the Exchange to list and
trade FLEX Options based on the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (``S&amp;P'') 100 (``OEX'') and 500 (``SPX'')
Indexes.

A market participant's ability to designate the expiration date is not without limitation. Specifically, in order
to protect against possible market disruptions that may otherwise result from the concurrent expiration of listed
options and FLEX Options, the expiration dates for FLEX Options must be at least three business days away from the expiration
dates for existing listed options.

In the FLEX Options Approval Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 note 4, the Commission designated FLEX Options as ``standardized options'' for purposes of the options disclosure
framework established under Rule 9b-1 under the Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31919 (February 24, 1993), 58 FR 12286 (March 3, 1993) (``9b-1 Order''). For the
same reasons stated in the 9b-1 Order, FLEX Options on specified foreign currencies are deemed ``standardized options''
for purposes of the Rule 9b-1 options disclosure framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the present proposal, the CBOE is seeking to expand its FLEX Options program to allow FLEX Options to be designated
for trading and settled in certain specified foreign currencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permitted designated foreign currencies include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, Deutsche
Marks, Swiss Francs, French Francs, or European Currency Units (``ECU''), as well as U.S. Dollars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In implementing its proposal, the CBOE is changing CBOE Rule 24A.4 (``Rule 24A.4'') (``Terms of FLEX Contracts'')
in three ways. First, the CBOE proposes amending Rule 24A.4(c) to add settlement currency to the list of contract term
categories that parties to any FLEX Option contract are required to designate. Second, the CBOE proposes amending
Rule 24A.4(d) to make it clear that bids and offers responsive to FLEX Requests for Quotes
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 must be stated in terms of the designated currency and may be expressed only as a specific designated currency amount

 (and thus not in the form of a fractional price). Third, the CBOE proposes amending Rule 24A.4(f) to list the various
currencies in which FLEX Options may be quoted, traded, and settled (``Eligible Currencies'').

CBOE Rule 24A.1 defines ``Underlying Equivalent Value'' to mean the aggregate underlying monetary value covered
by that number of contracts, derived by multiplying the index multiplier by the current index value times the given
number of FLEX Options contracts.

Minor changes to certain other FLEX Options rules have also been proposed by the Exchange. The Exchange proposes to
add a new paragraph (g) to Rule 24A.5 (``FLEX Trading Procedures and Principals'') to specify for each Eligible Currency
the minimum permissible increments of change in currency amounts for successive FLEX Quotes. Also, the Exchange
proposes an amendment to Rule 24A.9 respecting appointment of FLEX Market Makers to clarify that the CBOE will appoint
market makers to FLEX Options in respect of particular settlement currencies for FLEX Option-eligible indexes.

Finally, new definitions, as well as changes to certain existing definitions, are proposed. Specifically, a definition
of the term ``Index Multiplier'' is proposed to be added to Rule 24A.1 that would identify the applicable Index Multiplier
for each settlement currency.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Also, the Exchange proposes amending the term ``Underlying Equivalent Value''
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 to state that aggregate underlying monetary values will be computed in terms of U.S. Dollars, regardless of the settlement
currency involved. Such computations are intended to simplify the administration of FLEX Option rules that refer
to Underlying Equivalent Values.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the proposed rule change defines the term ``Series of FLEX Options,'' which is used in the current FLEX
Options rules without being specifically defined, to mean all FLEX Option contracts of the same class having the same
exercise price, exercise style, exercise settlement value, expiration date, and index multiplier.

For example, CBOE Rule 24A.4(e)(ii) requires that the minimum value of an opening transaction in any FLEX series for

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds the proposed rule change consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5)
and 11A of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 because the proposed rule change is designed to provide investors with a tailored or customized product that may be
more suitable to their investment needs. As noted by the CBOE, the OTC market in customized index options has developed,
in part, to meet the needs of institutional investors who require increased flexibility for the purpose of satisfying
particular investment objectives that could not be met by the standardized or exchange markets in options. Accordingly,
the Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal to expand the list of variable FLEX Option contract terms to include
certain designated foreign currencies is a reasonable response by the Exchange to meet the demands of sophisticated
portfolio managers and other institutional investors. These investors increasingly have relied on the OTC market
to satisfy their hedging needs; therefore, the CBOE's proposal will promote competition among these markets.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal will help to promote the maintenance of a fair and orderly
market because the purpose of the proposal is to extend the benefits of a listed exchange market to FLEX Options that
trade and settle in certain designated foreign currencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of the Exchange's options market versus the OTC market include, but are not limited to, a centralized
market center, an auction market with posted transparent market quotations and transaction reporting, standardized
contract specifications, parameters and procedures for clearance and settlement, and the guarantee of The Options
Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') for all contracts traded on the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also should benefit investors by providing them more flexibility by permitting them to designate settlement
terms in various foreign currencies while continuing to ensure adequate investor protection in the trading of these
products. Each of the designated currencies is a world-wide currency and currently eligible for options trading
individually. The potential risks of settling FLEX Options in foreign currencies rather than U.S. Dollars is also
disclosed in the recently amended Options Disclosure Document (``ODD'') pursuant to Rule 9b&hyph;1 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 The amended ODD now states that the settlement currency may be a variable term fixed by the parties out of those currencies
specified by the options market on which the transaction occurs as being available for flexibly structured options.
The ODD also describes certain inherent characteristics and risks associated with transactions that involve foreign
currencies.

The Commission finds that the Index Multipliers and the incremental changes for bids and offers selected by the CBOE
are reasonable. In each instance, the value of the amount of each foreign currency selected by the CBOE is generally
equivalent to the corresponding amount of U.S. Dollars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also finds that it is appropriate for the Exchange to appoint market markers to FLEX Options with respect
to the particular settlement currencies of each eligible FLEX Options index.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Distinguishing among the various settlement currencies in this fashion should help ensure that market makers will
have the experience and expertise to quote FLEX Options in the particular currency.

Finally, based on representations from the CBOE, the Commission believes that the CBOE and Options Price Reporting
Authority (``OPRA'') will have adequate systems processing capacity to accommodate FLEX Options containing a contract
term relating to settlement currency.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, OPRA has represented that any additional traffic generated by the CBOE's proposal is within OPRA's capacity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the Act, and, in particular,
Sections 6 and 11A of the Act. In addition, the Commission also finds, pursuant to Rule 9b&hyph;1 under the Act, that
FLEX Options with a contract term relating to settlement currency are standardized options for purposes of the options
disclosure framework established under Rule 9b&hyph;1.

The proposed rule change enables ID system users to use the ID system interactively. Specifically, this enhancement
allows for the interactive receipt of trade input and affirmations and for the interactive distribution of confirmations
and certain trade reports. It provides users with the capability of accomplishing all ID system processing within
a single business day. ID system users have the option to continue to use the ID system in a batch mode.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also implements two optional electronic mail features.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 These features enable ID system users to send and receive ``notification of order execution'' and ``institution
instruction'' messages. A notification of order execution can be sent by a broker-dealer to communicate the details
of an order execution to an institution. If the institution accepts the notification of order execution, the institution
can send the broker-dealer an institution instruction containing information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the allocation of shares in a block trade) which is needed by the broker-dealer in order to enter trade data into the
ID system for the preparation of confirmations. Currently, broker-dealers and institutions make telephone calls,
send facsimile transmissions, or utilize the services of a private electronic trade confirmation vendor to communicate
this information.

The filing which proposed the overall enhanced ID concept discussed three electronic mail features (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
``notification of order execution,'' ``institution instruction,'' and ``institution request for cancellation/correction'').
The cancellation/correction feature is not ready for implementation at this time and therefore is not a subject of
this approval order. When DTC is prepared to implement the cancellation/correction feature or any other new electronic
mail feature, it should submit a proposed rule change filing under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency, such as DTC, be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. As discussed below, the Commission believes that DTC's proposed rule
change is consistent with this obligation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the electronic mail features will enable ID system users to eliminate their reliance
on telephone calls or facsimile transmissions when communicating information such as the details of order executions
or allocations for block trades. The Commission believes that transmitting this information electronically is
more efficient and accurate than the methods currently used and, therefore, will promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of institutional transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also believes that the interactive capability is essential to the industry's conversion to a three
business day settlement cycle, which will be the standard settlement time for most broker-dealer trades beginning
June 1, 1995.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Because interactive capability will enables ID system users to confirm and affirm institutional transactions in
one business day, it should facilitate users' ability to settle their transactions on the third day after the trade.

For a detailed description and discussion of the conversion to a three business day settlement cycle, see Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 13, 1993), 58 FR 52891 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (adopting Commission
Rule 15c6&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because the electronic mail features and specifically the interactive capability are critical to converting
to a three business day settlement cycle and should be implemented as soon as possible to provide ID system users with
time to become accustomed to the new features before June 1, 1995.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act, and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
June 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 23, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one establishing
or changing a fee under &sect;19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the Commission's
receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from
interested persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule A to the By-Laws to adjust the amount of credit as set forth in Section
1(d) of Schedule A, which is currently 50%, to 62%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Article VI of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the NASD requires its members to pay an annual assessment
fee based on gross income as defined by Schedule A, Section 1 to the By-Laws. The NASD also allows a credit against such
assessment pursuant to Subsection (d) to Section 1. The NASD calculates the gross income assessment from the gross
income reported for the calendar or fiscal year preceding the NASD's calendar budget year. Based on the operating
budget for 1994 and final actual gross income reports for 1993, the NASD is proposing to amend the credit to adjust member
assessments to reflect the revenue needed to fund 1994 operations. This proposed rule change, therefore, amends
the amount of credit set forth in Section 1(d) of Schedule A to the By-Laws, which is currently 59%, to 62%, and applies
the credit to the entire 1994 calendar budget year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members in that the proposed rule change equitable adjusts the 1994 assessment credit rate based
on the projected 1994 operating budget and actual gross income reports for 1993.

or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.

Previously, OCC has filed with the Commission and the Commission has temporarily approved rule changes which modify
the standards for letters of credit deposited with OCC as margin.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Like the previous filings, this filing makes several modifications to Rule 604, which sets forth the standards for
acceptable forms of collateral deposited with OCC as margin. With respect to letters of credit constituting an acceptable
form of margin, the following standards must be followed. First, in order to conform to the Uniform Commercial Code
and to avoid any ambiguity as to the latest time for honoring demands upon letters of credit, letters of credit must
state expressly that payment must be made prior to the close of business on the third banking day following demand.
Second, letters of credit must be irrevocable. Third, letters of credit must expire on a quarterly basis. OCC also
is adding to Rule 604 language to make explicit its authority to draw upon letters of credit at any time, whether or not
the clearing member that deposited the letter of credit has been suspended or is in default, if OCC determines that
such draws are advisable to protect OCC, other clearing members, or the general public.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and specifically with Section
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.

The revised standards should make letters of credit deposited as margin more liquid instruments and, consequently,
should permit OCC to more safely rely upon such letters of credit. Because the revised standards will induce letter
of credit issuers to reexamine clearing members' financial conditions every three months rather than annually as
under the prior standards, the financial conditions of clearing members electing to deposit letters of credit as
margin should be assessed more frequently. More frequent assessments should facilitate the discovery of any adverse
developments in a more timely manner. In addition, because letters of credit will be irrevocable, issuers of letters
of credit no longer will be able to revoke letters of credit at times when the clearing members most need credit facilities
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when a clearing member is experiencing financial difficulties or during times of market volatility). By approving
the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through June 30, 1995, OCC, the Commission, and other interested parties
will be able to assess further, prior to permanent Commission approval, any effects the revised standards have on
letter of credit issuance and on margin deposited at OCC.

The Commission and OCC currently are studying concentration limits on letters of credit deposited as margin. The
Division believes that clearing agencies that accept letters of credit as margin deposits or clearing fund contributions
should limit their exposure by imposing concentration limits on the use of letters of credit. Generally, clearing
agencies impose limitations on the percentage of an individual member's required deposit or contribution that may
be satisfied with letters of credit, limitations on the percentage of the total required deposits or contributions
that may be satisfied with letters of credit by any one issuer, or some combination of both. OCC has no concentration
limits on the use of letters of credit issued by U.S. institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because
the Commission believes it is desirable that the proposed rule change be approved before the expiration of the Commission's
previous order granting temporary approval of these modifications to the letter of credit standards. By approving
this proposed rule filing before expiration of the prior temporary approval order, the changes that have been implemented
pursuant to the temporary approval order may remain in place during the further assessment of any effects the revised
standards have on the issuance of letters of credit and on margin deposited at OCC pending permanent approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of OCC. All submissions should refer to the file number SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;06
and should be submitted by July 11, 1994.

V. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that OCC's proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in
particular with Section 17A of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposal (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;06) be, and hereby is, approved
through June 30, 1995.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. AI Holdings is a holding company with more than 100 shareholders whose principal asset is the stock of Newco, a developer
and manufacturer of automatic meter reading products for utility companies. The founders of the business, James
Heisey and Carl Morris, serve as chief executive officer and president, respectively, of AI Holdings and Newco. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. AI Holdings entered into a reorganization agreement in 1992 with Ketema, Inc. because the business required further
capitalization to sustain its levels of operations. The reorganization provided Newco with $1.8 million in additional
capital. Ketema is a publicly traded holding company listed on the American Stock Exchange. Ketema has interests
in a number of diversified businesses and, as of September 30, 1993, had total assets exceeding $500 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In connection with the reorganization, Newco acquired all of the operating assets of the meter reading business,
and AI Holdings received 20% of Newco's voting stock. In exchange for its capital contribution, Ketema received 80%
of the voting stock of Newco. Ketema also received four votes on Newco's board of directors and AI Holdings received
one vote. Since the reorganization in 1992, Newco's board of directors has not had a meeting, and the board practice
has been to allow Heisey and Morris to operate Newco without active board involvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. As part of the reorganization, AI Holdings was provided with certain rights and privileges with respect to Newco.
For fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, AI Holdings as a preferred stockholder is entitled to dividend payments from
Newco in an amount equal to 80% of Newco's earnings before taxes and interest on a consolidated basis. In addition,
a shareholders' agreement between AI Holdings and Ketema, and the terms of AI Holdings preferred stock (the ``Agreements''),
prohibit Newco from effecting any merger, exchange, consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization in which
the then shareholders of American Innovations do not own at least 50% of the capital stock of the surviving corporation
following the transaction. In addition, without the approval of AI Holdings, American Innovations is prohibited
from selling all or substantially all of its assets, liquidating or dissolving, and from amending its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws to affect the terms of AI Holdings preferred stock adversely. Further, the Agreements
give AI Holdings right of first refusal to purchase Ketema's Newco shares in the event Ketema decides to sell such shares.
Ketema also has agreed not to acquire additional equity securities in Newco without the prior consent of AI Holdings.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. AI Holdings is an investment company under section 3(a)(3) because most of its assets are investment securities
as defined under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 AI Holdings requests an order under section 3(b)(2) declaring that it is primarily engaged in a non-investment company
business through a controlled company and under section 2(a)(9) declaring that it controls Newco even though it owns
less than 25% of the voting securities of Newco.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An issuer is considered an investment company under section 3(a)(3) if it is engaged in the business of owning or holding
investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer's total assets, exclusive of government
securities and cash. The Newco stock of AI Holdings meets the section 3(a) definition of investment securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 3(b)(2) authorizes the Commission to except an issuer from the section 3(a)(3) definition of investment
company if the Commission finds that the issuer is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business through
a controlled company. Because AI Holdings owns less than 25% of the voting securities of Newco, a determination under
section 2(a)(9) that AI Holdings controls Newco is a prerequisite to the ultimate determination of AI Holdings' investment
company status.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 2(a)(9) defines ``control'' as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies
of a company. The section creates a presumption that owners of 25% or less of a company's voting securities do not control
such company but this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. AI Holdings argues that a finding of control under section 2(a)(9) is warranted for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Since the reorganization, AI Holdings, through its officers, directors, and principal shareholders, has made
substantially all of the decisions about the management and operations of Newco. Further, without the engineering
and management skills of Heisey and Morris, Newco would be inoperable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Newco's board of directors does not take an active role in Newco's management. In addition, because of the Agreements,
the ability of Newco's board of directors to make any major corporate changes without the consent of AI Holdings is
limited, providing AI Holdings with effective control of such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The reorganization was effected in an effort to raise capital for the meter reading products business. The structure
of the reorganization was chosen to provide Katema with sufficient ownership to let it consolidate its financial
statements for tax and accounting purposes, while not diminishing AI Holdings' controlling influence over Newco
and its operations. Applicant argues that although the reorganization altered the ownership of the business, it
did not change its method of operation or the key individuals who had developed the product and managed the operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. AI Holdings also believes that a finding should be made under section 3(b)(2) that it is primarily engaged in a non-investment
company business through Newco for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. AI Holdings was organized as an operating company to develop, manufacture, and market automatic meter reading
products. The reorganization was effected because the business needed additional capital. The basic operations
of the automatic meter reading business has not changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. AI Holdings has never held itself out as being engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The business activities of the senior officers of AI Holdings have been almost exclusively limited to the automatic
meter reading products of Newco. None of the officers or directors are affiliated with any other investment company
or securities broker-dealer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The only assets of AI Holdings are its shares of stock in Newco and approximately $3,400 in cash.

referred to as the ``Adviser'').

SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants seek to amend an existing order that permits certain applicants to operate a joint trading account that
invests solely in commercial paper with a maturity of 30 days or less, repurchase agreements with maturities of seven
days or less, and securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, authorities, or instrumentalities
(``U.S. Government Securities'') with a maturity of 30 days or less.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The amended order would permit (a) cash contributed to the joint account also to be invested in (i) tax-exempt variable
rate demand notes (``VRDNs'') with demand features providing for maturities of up to 30 days or one month and (ii) securities
(other than VRDNs) exempt from federal and/or state income tax with remaining maturities of up to 60 days, (b) commercial
paper and U.S. Government Securities held in the joint account to have remaining maturities of up to 60 days (as opposed
to 30 days as permitted in the Prior Order), and (c) repurchase agreements held in the joint account to have maturities
of up to 60 days (as opposed to seven days as permitted by the Prior Order). Applicants also seek to amend the prior order
by adding certain additional investment company applicants.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each of the existing Funds is an open-end or a closed-end management investment company registered under the Act.
MFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. MFS is a registered investment adviser. Each of the existing Funds is advised
by MFS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Each of the existing Funds except MFS Series Trust and MFS Municipal Income Trust (the ``Existing Funds'') is currently
authorized to invest through a joint account pursuant to the Prior Order. The Prior Order permits each of the Existing
Funds to participate in a joint account (the ``Joint Account'') to pool cash balances and reserves for the purpose
of investing in (i) commercial paper with a remaining maturity of 30 days or less, (ii) one or more repurchase agreements
with a bank or major brokerage house with a maturity of seven days or less, or (iii) U.S. Government Securities with
remaining maturities of 30 days or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants propose to continue to operate the Joint Account in the same manner as permitted by the Prior Order, except
for the modifications discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to permit (a) cash invested in the Joint Account also to be invested in (i)
VRDNs with demand features providing for maturities of up to 30 days or one month and (ii) securities (other than VRDNs)
exempt from federal and/or state income tax with remaining maturities of up to 60 days (collectively, ``Tax-Exempt
Securities''), (b) commercial paper and U.S. Government Securities held in the Joint Account to have remaining maturities
of up to 60 days, and (c) repurchase agreements held in the Joint Account to have maturities of up to 60 days. The amended
order also would add MFS Municipal Series Trust and MFS Municipal Income Trust as named applicants and permit an existing
or future investment company (and all existing or future series thereof) not currently advised by MFS to participate
in the Joint Account if MFS or an existing or future company controlled by or under common control with MFS becomes an
investment adviser to the investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Tax-Exempt Securities include short-term tax-exempt demand obligations that have a variable or floating interest
rate and an unconditional right to demand payment of the unpaid principal and accrued interest within 30 days (or one
month). The variable or floating rate features of such securities provide for the readjustment of the interest rate
to a rate then prevailing for similar instruments so that such securities reasonably can be expected to maintain a
market value that approximates the par value of the notes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. While none of the existing Funds are tax-exempt money market funds, if a tax-exempt money market fund contributes
cash to the Joint Account, such cash will only be invested in securities that qualify for purchase by a tax-exempt money
market fund under rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Repurchase agreements are entered into with securities dealers and banks which are on the Advisers' approved list
for repurchase agreement counterparties (the ``Repo Approved List''). The Repo Approved List was compiled by securities
analysts and other employees of the Adviser based on such persons' assessment of whether the counterparty is financially
responsible. The Repo Approved List is reviewed by the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of each Fund (the ``Governing
Boards'') at least annually, although a Fund's Governing Board is not required to pre-approve a counterparty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Adviser for each Fund will determine whether to invest assets of such Fund in repurchase agreements, Tax-Exempt
Securities, U.S. Government Securities or commercial paper (collectively, ``Short-Term Investments''). The
existence of the Joint Account will not affect the decision of whether to invest in Short-Term Investments except
to the extent the Joint Account had available to it a particular Short-Term Investment which was not otherwise available
to a particular Fund and, on the basis of yield, credit worthiness, and liquidity, offered a competitive investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Each Fund will have the ability to purchase commercial paper, U.S. Government Securities, and repurchase agreements
through the Joint Account consistent with its investment objective and policies. In addition, each Fund will have
the ability to purchase Tax-Exempt Securities through the Joint Account consistent with its investment objective
and policies. Each Fund may, but is not obligated to, invest not only cash which in the absence of the Joint Account would
remain uninvested but also cash which in the absence of the Joint Account would be individually invested in Short-Term
Investments pursuant to a Fund's investment objective and policies. Transactions in the Joint Account will be recorded
and monitored pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Prior Order.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1(a), taken together, prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment
company, or an affiliated person of such a person, from participating in any joint enterprise or arrangement in which
such investment company is a participant, without an SEC order. Rule 17d&hyph;1(b) provides that in passing upon
applications under section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1, the SEC will consider whether each party's participation
in the proposed joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent
to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Each Fund, by participating in the proposed Joint Account as proposed to be modified, and the Advisers, by administering
the proposed Joint Account, could be deemed to be ``joint participants'' in a transaction within the meaning of section
17(d), and the proposed Joint Account could be deemed to be a ``joint enterprise or other joint arrangement'' within
the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants believe that the proposed method of operating the Joint Account will not result in any conflicts of interest
between any of the Funds or between a Fund and its Adviser. Although the Adviser will gain some benefit through administrative
convenience and a possible reduction in clerical costs, the primary beneficiaries will be the Funds because the Joint
Account will be a more efficient way of administering these investment transactions. Applicants believe that the
operation of the Joint Account will be free of any inherent bias favoring one Fund over another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants further believe that future participation in the Joint Account by one or more Funds which do not presently
exist or are not presently advised by an Adviser would be desirable without the necessity of applying for an amendment
to the requested order. Applicants represent that additional Funds will be permitted to participate in the Joint
Account only on the same terms and conditions as the existing Funds have set forth herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Existing Funds have received the Prior Order from the SEC permitting the operation of the existing Joint Account
with respect to repurchase agreements with a maximum maturity of seven days and commercial paper and U.S. Government
Securities with maximum remaining maturities of 30 days. Applicants submit that the proposed amendment to the Prior
Order is consistent with the findings required by section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder for granting
orders pursuant to rule 17d&hyph;1, including the finding that any Fund would participate in the Joint Account on
a basis no different from or less advantageous than that of any other Fund.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Joint Account will operate subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each Fund will transfer into the Joint Account the cash it wishes to invest through the Joint Account after the calculation
of its daily cash available for investment and will specifically indicate whether the cash is to be used to purchase
commercial paper, Tax-Exempt Securities, repurchase agreements, or U.S. Government Securities. The Joint Account
will not be distinguishable from any other accounts maintained by a Fund with its custodian bank except that monies
from a Fund will be deposited on a commingled basis. The Joint Account will not have any separate existence which will
have indicia of a separate legal entity. The sole function of the Joint Account will be to provide a convenient way of
aggregating individual transactions which would otherwise require management by each Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cash contributed by a Fund to the Joint Account will be invested in one or more of the following, as directed by the
Fund: (1) Interest bearing or discounted commercial paper with a remaining maturity not to exceed 60 days; (2) repurchase
agreements, with maturities not to exceed 60 days, ``collateralized fully,'' as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7
under the Act, by U.S. Government Securities; (3) U.S. Government Securities with remaining maturities of up to 30
days or one month; (4) VRDNs that have demand features providing for maturities of up to 30 days or one month; or (5) securities
other than VRDNs exempt from federal and/or state income tax with remaining maturities of up to 60 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Any investment made by a Fund or Funds through the Joint Account will satisfy the investment criteria of all Funds
participating in that investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. All investments held by a Fund or Funds through the Joint Account will be valued on the basis of amortized cost to the
extent permitted by applicable Commission release, rule, or order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Each Fund valuing its net assets in reliance upon rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act will use the average maturity of the
instrument(s) in the Joint Account in which such Fund has an interest (determined on a dollar weighted basis) for the
purpose of computing the Fund's average portfolio maturity with respect to the portion of its assets held in the Joint
Account on that day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In order to assure that there will be no opportunity for one Fund to use any part of a balance of the Joint Account credited
to another Fund, no Fund will be allowed to create a negative balance in the Joint Account for any reason. A Fund's decision
to invest through the Joint Account will be solely at the Fund's option. No Fund will be obligated to invest through
the Joint Account or maintain any minimum balance therein. In addition, each Fund will retain the sole rights of ownership
of any of its assets held through the Joint Account, including interest payable on such assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Adviser and the custodian of each Fund will maintain records (in conformity with section 31 of the Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder) documenting, for any given day, each Fund's aggregate investment in the Joint
Account and each Fund's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of each Short-Term Investment made through the Joint Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Not every Fund participating in the Joint Account will necessarily have its cash invested in every Short-Term Investment
held in the Joint Account. However, to the extent a Fund's cash is applied to a particular Short-Term Investment made
through the Joint Account, the Fund will participate in and own a proportionate share of such investment, and the income
earned or accrued thereon, based upon the percentage of such investment purchased with monies contributed by the
Fund.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The Adviser will administer the investments of the Joint Account as part of its duty under its existing or any future
investment advisory contracts with each Fund and will not collect any additional fee for the management of the Joint
Account. (The Adviser will collect fees in accordance with each Fund's respective investment advisory agreement.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Governing Boards of the Funds will adopt procedures pursuant to which the Joint Account will operate, which
will be reasonably designed to provide that the requirements of the application will be met. Each of the Governing
Boards will make and approve such changes as it deems necessary to ensure that such procedures are followed. In addition,
the Governing Boards will determine, no less frequently than annually, that the Joint Account has been operated in
accordance with such procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The administration of the Joint Account will be within the fidelity bond coverage required by section 17(g) of
the Act and rule 17g&hyph;1 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Short-Term Investments held through the Joint Account generally will not be sold prior to maturity except: (i)
If the Adviser believes the security no longer presents minimal credit risk; (ii) in the case of commercial paper of
Tax-Exempt Securities, if as a result of a credit downgrading or otherwise, the security no longer satisfies the investment
criteria of all Funds participating in that investment; or (iii) in the case of a repurchase agreement, if the counterparty
defaults. A Fund may, however, sell its fractional portion of a Short-Term Investment prior to the maturity of the
investment if the cost of such transaction will be borne solely by the selling Fund and the transaction would not adversely
affect the other Funds participating in the Short-Term Investment. In no case would an early termination by less than
all participating Funds be permitted if it would reduce the principal amount or yield received by other Funds participating
in a particular Short-Term Investment or otherwise adversely affect the other participating Funds. Each Fund participating
in the Short-Term Investment will be deemed to have consented to such sale and partition of the Short-Term Investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Any Short-Term Investment held through the Joint Account with a remaining maturity of more than seven days will
be considered illiquid and, for any fund that is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act,
subject to the restriction that the Fund may not invest more than 15% (or such other percentage as set forth by the Commission
from time to time) of its net assets in illiquid securities, if the Fund cannot sell its fractional interest in the Short-Term
Investment pursuant to the requirements described in the preceding condition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application Number 3289. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The FRA has issued a public notice seeking comments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties and is conducting a field investigation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this matter. After examining the carrier's proposal, letters of protest, and available facts, the FRA has determined
that a public hearing is necessary before a final decision is made on this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, a public hearing is hereby set for 10 a.m. on
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thursday, July 28, 1994, in room 221 of the Federal Building and U.S. Court House, located at 211 East 7th Street, Eugene,
Oregon. Interested parties are invited to present oral statements at the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be an informal one and will be conducted in accordance with Rule 25 of the FRA Rules of Practice (49 CFR
Part 211.25), by a representative designated by the FRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The hearing will be a nonadversary proceeding and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, there will be no cross-examination of persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presenting statements. The FRA representative will make an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opening statement outlining the scope of the hearing. After all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial statements have been completed, those persons wishing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make brief rebuttal statements will be given the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do so in the same order in which they made their initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. Additional procedures, if necessary for the conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the hearing, will be announced at the hearing.

 In accordance with the procedures governing the application for, and the processing of, exemptions from the Department
of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Part 107, Subpart B), notice is hereby given that the
Office of Hazardous Materials Safety has received the applications described herein. This notice is abbreviated
to expedite docketing and public notice. Because the sections affected, modes of transportation, and the nature
of application have been shown in earlier Federal Register publications, they are not repeated here. Requests for
modifications of exemptions (e.g. to provide for additional hazardous materials, packaging design changes, additional
mode of transportation, etc.) are described in footnotes to the application number. Application numbers with the
suffix ``X'' denote a modification request. Application numbers with the suffix ``P'' denote a party to request.
These applications have been separated from the new applications for exemptions to facilitate processing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The U.S. Departments of Labor and Education are conducting separate competitions for grants to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that are prepared to implement statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems, to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
local partnerships
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that are prepared to implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives, and to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
local partnerships that serve high poverty areas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and that are also prepared to develop and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these areas.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This notice announces the competition for Urban/Rural opportunities Grants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grants under this competition will be financed under title IV of the Job Training Partnership Act to enable local partnerships
to begin implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in high poverty areas of urban and rural communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Partnerships in high poverty areas face particular challenges in implementing School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There are few large private or public employers in high poverty areas, making it more difficult to secure employer
participation, work-based learning opportunities, and career-track jobs for youth who complete a School-to-Work
Opportunities program. Therefore, creative strategies must be developed to fully utilize the capacity of local
institutions to include a variety of alternative work-based learning environments and to support intensive efforts
to enhance diverse employer involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Dropout rates of schools in high poverty areas in many cases are over 50 percent, and interventions to improve schools
may need to begin in the elementary or middle school years. School-to-Work Opportunities programs can provide more
relevant and engaging school-based and work-based activities which can encourage youth to remain in school until
completion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Students at schools in high poverty areas will be poorer and may be much less aware of college opportunities than
students in other areas. This, coupled with financial constraints, may make them more likely to seek immediate job
placement prior to or immediately upon high school graduation, regardless of whether those jobs have potential for
long-term career opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In most high poverty area neighborhoods, peer pressure is a strong force which does not necessarily promote achievement.
School-to-Work Opportunities programs that offer alternative learning environments and creative approaches
to academic and technical subjects can make success in school more attractive to these youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Youth in high poverty areas are likely to experience pressure from situations outside of school which may affect
their performance in school. To turn around the prevailing negative forces operating on youth, School-to-Work Opportunities
initiatives in these neighborhoods will need to be complemented by various community-wide interventions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Schools in high poverty areas are more likely to have students of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds than schools
in other areas. In addition, high poverty area schools often serve a higher percentage of students with distinctive
learning needs; therefore, School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these areas should be designed to meet
the needs of these youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Because of the high dropout rates in many high poverty areas, there will be proportionately many more out-of-school
youth in these areas than in other communities. School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives should include linkages
with institutions that meet the special needs of such youth by improving their ability to make a transition into education
and/or employment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. The quality of educational and employment opportunities is often uneven among high poverty area youth, thus requiring
that careful consideration be given to enhancing both the access and availability of opportunities to all area youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this competition, awards will be made to local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in high
poverty areas to address their special needs and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives, as
defined in this notice. Approximately $10 million are available for awards under this notice. The Departments expect
to award 15 to 25 12-month grants. The amount of the awards will be based on a number of factors, including the scope,
quality, and comprehensiveness of the proposed initiative and the size of the population to be served. While there
are no limitations on the size of a high poverty area, the Departments expect that the resources available for individual
grants will effectively serve areas of no more than 50,000 in population. The Departments are not bound by the estimates
in this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Departments intend to conduct subsequent competitions for Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants, on an annual basis,
under the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' A local partnership shall be eligible
to receive only one (1) grant under this notice, with grant renewals to be awarded depending upon fund availability.

Section B. Application Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A local entity that both meets the definition of ``local partnership'' and proposes to serve youth residing in areas
meeting the definition of ``high poverty area'' in section B.7. of this notice is eligible to apply for an Urban/Rural
Opportunities Grant. An eligible partnership must include employers, representatives of local educational agencies
and local postsecondary educational institutions (including representatives of area vocational education schools,
where applicable), local educators (such as teachers, counselors, or administrators), representatives of labor
organizations or nonmanagerial employee representatives, and students. Other entities appropriate to effective
development and implementation of the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative, particularly community-based
organizations with experience, expertise, and demonstrated success in addressing the needs of youth within the
targeted area, should also be included in the partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section C. Statement of Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States is the only industrialized nation that lacks a comprehensive and coherent system to help its youth
acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities, and information about the labor market necessary to make an effective
transition from school to career-oriented work. Three-fourths of America's high school students do not attain four-year
college degrees. Many of them do not possess the basic academic and occupational skills necessary for entry into high-skill,
high-wage careers in the changing workplace or to pursue further education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to create a national framework for high-quality, statewide school-to-work transition systems that enable
young Americans to identify and navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace,
the Secretaries of Education and Labor have developed the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Under this
initiative, which is based on the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994,'' the Departments
of Education and Labor are using current legislative authority in fiscal year 1994 to begin the development and implementation
of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems in every State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Helping youth who reside or attend school in impoverished rural and urban communities navigate paths to productive
and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace will require extraordinary efforts due to the distinctive
needs and limited resources in such areas. Within high poverty areas, existing family and community resources are
often severely strained; traditional educational experiences in the schools fail to motivate many students to learn;
high rates of joblessness and dependency exist among adults, restricting the number of positive role models; and
access to high-skill, high-wage jobs and postsecondary education and training is severely limited. In order to permit
a concentration of resources to address such barriers affecting the educational and training experiences of youth
in high poverty areas, the Departments are conducting the competition announced in this notice to award grants to
local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in urban or rural high poverty areas to develop and implement
local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives that meet the requirements established in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall purpose of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is to support the development and initial stages
of implementation of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems within which local partnerships will apply
to the State for funds to develop programs. Under the initiative, each State is expected to receive a State Implementation
Grant, described below in ``Grant Program Schedule,'' under which the State will be required to expand the State's
School-to-Work Opportunities system over time to cover all geographic areas of the State, including those with high
concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. However, through separate competitions, local partnerships_including
those serving youth who reside or attend school in a high poverty area_may apply directly to the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that the States will benefit from the experiences of the local partnerships and may incorporate successful
elements of local initiatives into their statewide systems. Local and State programs may be developed by enhancing
existing programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, youth apprenticeship, cooperative education,
school-to-apprenticeship, and business-education compacts. However, the purpose of funding under the School-to-Work
Opportunities initiative is not simply to augment existing programs, but rather to build statewide systems that
provide opportunities for all students to achieve the benefits and outcomes of the School-to-Work Opportunities
initiative. Building comprehensive systems will likely involve a combination of enhancing existing programs,
establishing linkages among them, and developing an effective framework that connects both existing and new programs
in a meaningful way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Youth in urban and rural high poverty areas may require academic and needs assessments prior to participation in School-to-Work
Opportunities programs so that any skill deficiencies may be identified and elevated to grade-level performance
and any participation barriers may be alleviated. Due to such additional measures that may need to be taken prior to
local program implementation in a high poverty area and to the often high incidence of at-risk youth in such areas,
achieving school-to-work objectives in a high poverty area may take more time, innovation, and resources than in
those local areas where the incidence of high poverty is not so concentrated. Although the Departments recognize
this, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
the expected outcomes for all local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives are the same.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, since the overall purpose of funding under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is to build
statewide systems, a local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas will be required
to consult with the State within which it is located on the State's plans for creating a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities
system, as well as consult eventually with the local partnership in the State-designated geographic area within
which it is located. The purpose of such consultations is to assure that School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives
funded under this notice meet the same high standards and lead to the same outcomes as other School-to-Work Opportunities
initiatives throughout the State.

The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is proceeding on two funding tracks_(1) during fiscal year 1994, the
initiative is being funded under current legislative authority in the Job Training Partnership Act and the Carl D.
Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; and (2) for fiscal year 1995 and beyond, it will be funded
under the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' However, since programs begun in 1994
will be continued in fiscal year 1995 and beyond, the Departments have modeled the proposed grant program, to the extent
possible, upon the recent legislation. The funds will be made available through a grants program administered cooperatively
by the Department of Education and the Department of Labor that consists of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) State Development Grants, which have been awarded to each State for developing a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities
plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) State Implementation Grants, awarded competitively to States that can demonstrate substantial ability to begin
full-scale operations and implement the Statewide plan (the first round of State Implementation Grants are expected
to be announced in June, 1994);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Local Partnership Grants, awarded competitively to localities that are prepared to implement School-to-Work
Opportunities initiatives (the first round of Local Partnership Grants are expected to be announced in early July,
1994);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants, as announced in this notice, awarded competitively to local partnerships to
support the development and implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities programs in urban and rural areas of
high poverty; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Grants for Territories and for Native American programs, to support School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives
in the territories and for Indian youth, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local partnerships are eligible for direct Federal funding to implement programs throughout their entire local
area and in high poverty areas, through separate competitions, in the current program year. The intent of this funding
strategy is to begin implementation of local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in ``leading edge'' communities
and to provide supplemental resources to selected local partnerships serving youth residing or attending school
in high poverty areas, even if the States in which they are located are still in the systems development phase. This
will allow a State in the development phase to learn from innovative local partnerships in their own State and in others
and will build incentives for States and localities to work together to maximize funding within the State. Local partnerships
may apply for or request extensions of Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants serving high poverty areas even if they receive
School-to-Work Opportunities funding through State grants or through direct Federal funding. The Urban/Rural
Opportunities Grants are in addition to other funds for which the local partnership may be eligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A local partnership applying for a Urban/Rural Opportunities grant under this competition should consult with the
State at the earliest possible time. These consultations will permit local initiatives to be designed so that they
are, or will be, consistent with State plans for a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system.
The current funding strategy could result in a State, a local partnership, and a local partnership serving youth who
reside or attend school in a high poverty area each receiving a competitive implementation grant award in 1994. Therefore,
the possibility exists that an Urban/Rural Opportunities Grant may be awarded to a partnership serving youth residing
or attending school in a high poverty area that is located within the jurisdiction or a larger local partnership and
within a State that each receive Implementation Grants. Thus, consultation and coordination among the grantees
are essential to the creation of a comprehensive statewide system that provides opportunities for all students to
participate in School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives that meet the same high standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative provides for a substantial degree of State and local flexibility and
experimentation, but all State systems and individual local initiatives will share several common features and
basic program components as required by the ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' A local School-to-Work
Opportunities initiative under this competition must include the following common features and basic program components:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Part III. Application Contents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An eligible applicant must submit an application that includes the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The State's comments on the application. The local partnership serving a higher poverty area must submit its application
to the State for review and comment before submitting the application to the Department. Many States have designated
a State School-to-Work Opportunities contact. Applicants should call the office of their Governor for the name of
the School-to-Work Opportunities contact. The Departments expect that all State School-to-Work Opportunities
team members (e.g., the Governor; the State educational agency; the State agency officials responsible for economic
development, employment, job training, and postsecondary education; and other appropriate officials on the State
team) will be provided an opportunity to review and comment on the local partnership's application. Of particular
importance to the Departments are the State's comments on the consistency of the local partnership's planned activities
with the State's plans for a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system and the relationship
of any proposed activities with other local plans, especially where the grant applicant is not an identified local
partnership within the State system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State's comments must be included in the local partnership's application; however, the local partnership may
submit the application without State comment if proof of receipt by the State office is provided that the State was
given the opportunity to comment, but did not do so within ten (10) days of receiving the request. A State's written
comments received by the Department after this time will still be given consideration, if received within ten (10)
days of the closing date for receipt of applications in order to be considered, although the local partnership will
no longer be responsible for the submission of the State's comments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. A description of the composition of the local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty
areas. The application must identify the members of the local partnership, which must include employers, representatives
of local educational agencies and local postsecondary educational institutions (including representatives of
area vocational education schools, where applicable), local educators (such as teachers, counselors, or administrators),
representatives of labor organizations or nonmangerial employee representatives, and students, and may include
others appropriate to effective implementation of the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative; the
respective roles of each member; and how the partnership is organized to successfully implement the planned local
School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Given the particular needs in high poverty areas, special efforts should
be made to recruit and involve community-based organizations which demonstrate the ability to successfully identify
and address the special needs of the youth within the high poverty area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A description of the targeted area to be covered, and its relationship to the entire urban or rural labor market.
Included in the description should be information on specific employer needs; industry and occupational growth
projections; and high-demand, high-wage careers to be targeted. Since high poverty areas frequently lack industries
that provide high-skill, high-wage positions and that are able to provide work-based learning opportunities, the
description should include information for the entire labor market area in which the high poverty area is located.
In addition to the description, a map should be provided indicating the urban census tract(s), block number area(s),
or Indian reservation to be served by the local partnership; the population of each urban census tract, block number
area, or Indian reservation to be served, along with the total population of the targeted area; and the poverty rate
of each urban census tract, block number area, or Indian reservation, among individuals who have not attained the
age of 22, as determined by the Bureau of the Census, along with an average poverty rate for the entire area to be served.
(NOTE: Such Bureau of the Census information may be obtained through a local college or university, city planning
department, state data center; or through the Data User Service Division of the Bureau of the Census: Telephone No.,
301&hyph;763&hyph;1150.) Population data published by the Bureau of the Census is provided in age ranges: 0&hyph;5,
5, 6&hyph;11, 12&hyph;17, 18&hyph;24, and 25 and up. Since the age range up to age 17 would be the most inclusive in terms
of enabling local areas to meet the high poverty area definition [see Section B. 7., ``Definitions''], the Departments
will accept data from this range.)

Under the fiscal year 1994 School-to-Work Opportunities Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants competition, a careful
evaluation of applications will be made by a panel of (a) peer reviewers and/or (b) specialists within the Departments
of Labor and Education. Each panelist will evaluate the applications against the criteria listed below, with emphasis
on the scope and quality of the proposed plan and with careful consideration to the effectiveness, rather than the
presence, of each program component. The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on the Government. In
providing grants under this notice, the Departments shall give priority to Urban/Rural Opportunities local partnerships
that have demonstrated effectiveness in the delivery of comprehensive vocational preparation programs with successful
rates in job placement through cooperative activities among local educational agencies, local businesses, labor
organizations, and other organizations. Final funding decisions will be made based on the results of the panel review
process and such other factors as: geographic balance, diversity of programmatic approaches, replicability, sustainability,
innovation, and relative degree of poverty.

The Government will use the following selection criteria in evaluating applications:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope and Quality of Local School-to-Work Opportunities Initiative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(25 points). Is there an innovative and effective strategy for implementing a School-to-Work Opportunities initiative
in the high poverty area that integrates school-based learning and work-based learning, integrates academic and
occupational learning, and establishes effective linkages between secondary and postsecondary education? Does
the application demonstrate an effective strategy for targeting high-demand, high-wage jobs and relate that strategy
to the partnership's goals? What steps will the local partnership take to generate paid high-quality, work-based
learning experiences? How effectively are the common features and basic program components described in Part II.,
a., of the Statement of Work included in the local School-to-Work Opportunities initiative? Have promising existing
programs been considered for adaptation? Have new directions and approaches been planned to ensure that these programs
include the common features and basic program components? As the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative
becomes established within the targeted area, is there an effective long-range plan for integrating other existing
school-to-work programs with the initiative? Is the proposed local initiative effectively tied to a plan for educational
reform?

2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope and Effectiveness of Urban/Rural Opportunities Local Partnerships
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (25 points). Does the application demonstrate the strong commitment and support of employers (both within and surrounding
the targeted area), representatives of local educational agencies and local postsecondary educational institutions
(including representatives of area vocational education schools, where applicable), local educators (such as
teachers, counselors, or administrators), representatives of labor organizations or nonmanagerial employee
representatives, and students and provide for their sustained and specific involvement? Given the scope of the proposed
School-to-Work Opportunities initiative, does the local partnership include other members appropriate to effective
implementation, particularly community-based organizations and others experienced in dealing with the distinctive
needs of youth residing or attending schools in high poverty areas? Are the roles and responsibilities of the members
of the local partnership appropriate and likely to produce the desired changes in the way students are prepared for
the future? Does the local partnership's plan include an effective and convincing strategy for obtaining the active
and continued involvement of employers and other interested parties such as locally elected officials, secondary
and postsecondary educational institutions (or related agencies), business associations, industrial extension
centers, employees, labor organizations or associations of such organizations, teachers, related services personnel,
students, parents, community-based organizations, rehabilitation agencies and organizations, registered apprenticeship
agencies, local vocational educational agencies, vocational student organizations, State or regional cooperative
education associations, and human service agencies in the implementation of the local program(s)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Student Participation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (20 points). Does the plan propose realistic strategies to ensure that ``all students,'' including disadvantaged
students; students with diverse racial, ethnic, or cultural backgrounds; American Indians; Alaska Natives; Native
Hawaiians; students with disabilities; students with limited English proficiency; migrant children; school dropouts;
and academically talented students, have opportunities to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs?
Does the strategy recognize barriers to their participation and propose effective ways of overcoming them so that
these students are prepared for high-skill, high-wage jobs, including_for young women and minorities_nontraditional
employment? Does the plan provide for the direct delivery of services to large numbers of students residing or attending
school in the urban or rural high poverty area? Is there an effective strategy for assessing the academic and human
service needs of students and dropouts within the high poverty area and making improvements or adjustments as necessary
to ensure their successful participation in and completion of School-to-Work Opportunities programs? What, if
any, provisions are made for the participation of elementary and middle school youth in school-to-work activities,
such as career exploration and awareness?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comprehensiveness
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (10 points). To what extent has the local partnership considered the current and future occupational needs of the
urban or rural labor market area within which the targeted area is located? Does the membership representing employers
in the local partnership reflect such current and future occupational needs? How is the strategy for implementing
the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative likely to produce systemic change, rather than stand-alone program
implementation? What evidence is provided that such systemic change will have substantial impact on the preparation
of youth for a first job in a high-skill, high-wage career and postsecondary education and training? Is there existing
or planned collaboration among other school districts, employers, labor organizations, and community groups that
will lead to an increasingly comprehensive local School-to-Work Opportunities system? Are various forms of human
services provided within the community included in the partnership's plan for coordination? Are strategies in place
to coordinate various forms of Federal funding available to the urban or rural high poverty area? Does the local partnership's
plan exhibit strong potential for maintaining School-to-Work Opportunities programs after Federal funding within
this initiative ceases?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collaboration with State
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (10 points). To the extent practicable, has the local partnership effectively consulted with the State in which it
is located and established realistic methods for ensuring consistency of its program(s) with the statewide School-to-Work
Opportunities system being developed by the State? Has the local partnership developed a sound strategy for adapting
its plans, as necessary, to coincide with the State plan for a School-to-Work Opportunities system? If applicable,
has the Urban/Rural Opportunities local partnership established linkages with the local partnership within which
it is located and developed means by which to coordinate efforts and to share information regarding such items as work-based
learning opportunities, human service providers, and skill standards and certifications?

6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (10 points). What evidence exists to demonstrate the effectiveness of the local partnership and/or its key members
in the delivery of comprehensive vocational programs with successful job placement rates through cooperative activities
among local educational agencies, local businesses, labor organizations, and others? Does the entity submitting
the application on the part of the local partnership have the capacity to manage the implementation of the local School-to-Work
Opportunities initiative? Does the management plan anticipate barriers to implementation and include a system
for addressing them as they arise? Does the applicant limit administrative costs in order to maximize the amounts
spent on delivery of services to students enrolled in its School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Does the plan include
methods for sustaining and expanding the partnership beyond the high poverty area as the program expands in scope
and size? Is there an effective strategy for identifying and utilizing other resources, including private sector
resources, to maintain and expand School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Does the management plan reflect continuous
improvement methodologies by building in specific, outcome-based, evaluative checkpoints and the mechanisms
necessary to carry out improvements, redesigns, or mid-course corrections along the way? Are key personnel under
the plan qualified to perform the required activities, including maintaining the essential partnership?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by Public Law 99&hyph;660, CDC developed extensive vaccine information materials for distribution
by health care providers to distribute prior to their administering particular vaccines. In response to concerns
regarding the length and readability of the materials and the process for development of the materials, the law was
revised by Public Law 103&hyph;183, the Preventive Health Amendments of 1993, to provide for simplification of the
vaccine information materials. On January 26, 1994, CDC published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 3752) seeking public comment on proposed new vaccine information materials which were drafted under the revised
law. The 60-day comment period ended on March 28, 1994. Following review of the comments submitted and consultation
as required under the law, CDC has finalized the new vaccine information materials. Those final materials are contained
in this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title III of Public Law 99&hyph;660 (the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986) added a new Title XXI to the
Public Health Service Act. Section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&hyph;26) required
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop by rule extensive vaccine information materials for distribution
by health care providers to the legal representatives of any child receiving particular vaccines (i.e., diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio vaccines). These vaccine information materials were issued
as a final rule on October 15, 1991 (56 FR 51798; codified at 42 CFR Part 110). Since April 15, 1992, any health care provider
who intends to administer one of the covered vaccines is required to provide copies of vaccine information materials
that comply with the requirements of section 2126 prior to administration of these vaccines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on concerns expressed by providers and others about the length and readability of the vaccine information materials
(each of the three existing vaccine information pamphlets is 10 pages long) and the lengthy development and revision
process required by the rulemaking process (development of the materials took approximately three years), the Department
of Health and Human Services proposed legislation to amend section 2126 to provide for simplification of the vaccine
information materials. In section 708 of Public Law 103&hyph;183, the Preventive Health Amendments of 1993, which
was enacted on December 14, 1993, Congress revised section 2126 to: (1) delete the requirement for development and
revision of the vaccine information materials by rulemaking; (2) simplify the information to be included in the materials;
and (3) clarify that the materials must not only be provided to the parent or legal representative of a child receiving
a covered vaccine, but also must be provided to any adult who receives a covered vaccine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDC intends to repeal the vaccine information materials currently contained in Appendix A of 42 CFR Part 110, effective
September 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2126, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;183, requires that information contained in the revised materials
be based on available data and information, be presented in understandable terms, and include:

relevant information as may be determined by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law also requires that the materials be developed after notice to the public, with a 60-day comment period, and
in consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, appropriate health care provider and parent
organizations, and the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 26, 1994, CDC published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 3752) seeking public comment on proposed
new vaccine information materials which were drafted under the revised law. The 60-day comment period ended on March
28, 1994. On February 2, 1994, CDC met with consultants from the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, Food and
Drug Administration, American Nurses Association, Children's Defense Fund, March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation,
National Association of County Health Officials, American Academy of Pediatrics, Ohio Parents for Vaccine Safety,
Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition, Dissatisfied Parents Together, Association of State and Territorial
Health Officials, American Osteopathic Pediatricians, and American Academy of Family Physicians. Comments were
submitted by 32 individuals or organizations in response to the January 26 notice, and varied from those that focused
on conceptual objections to word choice suggestions. Comments from the consultants, along with the comments submitted
in response to the January 26 notice, were fully considered in revising the vaccine information materials, and suggestions
were incorporated if deemed appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of comments that were incorporated are the addition of a sentence stating that vaccines may be given simultaneously;
the addition of information on how to learn more about the vaccine (from the vaccine package insert, or other sources);
the use of graphics and a standard format for all VISs; and the revision of the vaccine schedules to be consistent with
recommendations of both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following consultation and review of comments submitted, new vaccine information materials which comply with the
provisions of the revised section 2126 have been finalized and are contained in this notice. They are entitled ``Polio
Vaccine: What you need to know before you or your child gets the vaccine,'' ``Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine (MMR):
What you need to know before you or your child gets the vaccine,'' ``Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (DTP):
What you need to know before your child gets the vaccine,'' and ``Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine (Td): What you need

the patient, or legal representative, acknowledging receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vaccine information materials. To ensure that a record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of the materials exists, health care providers shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a notation in each patient's permanent medical record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that the vaccine information materials were provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of the vaccination.

determine additional State requirements pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immunization. For example, state law determines who is qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consent to immunization of minors. The Federal requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the vaccine information materials supplements any

About the Disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Polio is a serious disease. It spreads when germs pass from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infected person to the mouths of others. Polio can: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Paralyze a person (make arms and legs unable to move). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cause death.

Benefits of the Vaccine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vaccination is the best way to protect against polio. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most children get the polio vaccine, there are now very few cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this disease. Before most children were vaccinated, there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousands of cases of polio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
There are 2 Kinds of Polio Vaccine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

accine is the one most often given to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children. It is given by mouth as drops. It is easy to give and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
works well to stop the spread of polio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

OPV Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most children should have a total of 4 OPV vaccines. They should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have OPV at:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other vaccines may be given at the same time as OPV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Who Should Get OPV? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most doctors recommend that almost all young children get OPV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But there are some cautions. Tell your doctor or nurse if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person getting the vaccine or anyone else in close contact with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the person getting the vaccine is less able to fight serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infections because of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A disease she/he was born with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Treatment with drugs such as long-term steroids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If so, your doctor or nurse will probably give IPV instead of OPV.

OPV, but not IPV. Ask your doctor or nurse if you are not sure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tell your doctor or nurse if the person getting the vaccine: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ever had a serious allergic reaction or other problem after getting polio vaccine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

What Are the Risks From Polio Vaccine? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems, even death, could occur after getting a vaccine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risks from the vaccine are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
much smaller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
than the risks from the disease if people stopped using vaccine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all people who get polio vaccine have no problems from it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Risks to people who never took polio vaccine who have close contact with the person taking OPV: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a person gets OPV, it can be found in his or her mouth and stool. If you never took polio vaccine, there is a very small
chance of getting polio disease from close contact with a child who got OPV in the past 30 days. (Examples of close contact
include changing diapers or kissing.)

As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems, even death, could occur after taking a vaccine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk from the vaccine are much smaller
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough) are

from an infected person to the nose or throat of others. Tetanus

is caused by a germ that enters the body through a cut or wound.

As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems, even death, could occur after getting a vaccine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risks from the vaccine are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
much smaller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
than the risks from the diseases if people stopped using vaccine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Below is a list of problems that may occur after getting the vaccine. If your child ever had one of the moderate or severe
problems listed below or any other serious problem after DTP, DTaP, or DT, discuss it with your doctor or nurse before
this vaccination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What to do if there is a serious reaction:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Write down what happened and the date and time it happened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to file a Vaccine Adverse Event Report form or call: (800) 822&hyph;7967
(toll-free).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program gives compensation (payment) for some persons thought to be injured
by vaccines. For details call: (800) 338&hyph;2382 (toll-free).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you want to learn more, ask your doctor or nurse. She/he can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tetanus (lockjaw), and diphtheria are serious diseases. Tetanus is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by a germ that enters the body through a cut or wound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diphtheria spreads when germs pass from an infected person to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nose or throat of others.

About the Vaccine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits of the Vaccine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vaccination is the best way to protect against tetanus and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diphtheria. Because of vaccination, there are many fewer cases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these diseases. Cases are rare in children because most get DTP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis), DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and acellular Pertussis) or DT (Diphtheria and Tetanus) vaccines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be many more cases if we stopped vaccinating people.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
When Should You Get Td Vaccine?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Td is made for people 7 years of age and older.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
People who have not gotten at least 3 doses of any tetanus and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diphtheria vaccine (DTP, DTaP, or DT) during their lifetime should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do so using Td. After a person gets the third dose, a Td dose is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed every 10 years all through life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other vaccines may be given at the same time as Td.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Tell your doctor or nurse if you:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Ever had a serious allergic reaction or other problem with Td, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or any other tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (DTP, DTaP, or DT).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Now have a moderate or severe illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are pregnant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you are not sure, ask your doctor or nurse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
What are the Risks From Td Vaccine?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
than the risks from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the diseases if people stopped using vaccine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all people who get Td have no problems from it.

These problems can be worse in adults who get Td vaccine very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Total amount available. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 28, 1991; at 105 Stat. 744) (1992 Appropriations Act) set aside
$25,000,000, of the $2,800,975,000 of budget authority available for modernization of existing public housing
developments, for the risk assessment of lead-based paint (LBP). However, amounts actually available from the appropriated
amount were reduced because conversions from Section 8 (U.S. Housing Act of 1937)-funded section 202 (Housing Act
of 1959) direct loan projects to rental assistance-funded section 202 grant projects did not occur at the rate anticipated
by Congress in the Appropriations Act. Reductions were made in the FY 1991 carryover balances to fund FY 1992 programs,
as provided in the Appropriations Act. The amount of funds available for LBP risk assessment in FY 1992 was $23,853,455.
Where funds awarded totaled less than the amount available, the remaining funds are to be carried over in subsequent
NOFAs. Thus, in FY 1992, the Department awarded $9,055,821. In FY 1993, $14,797,634 was available for LBP risk assessment
funding and $2,840,711 was awarded based on applications received. Additionally, $16,312 was awarded in FY 1994
to correct calculation errors made on applications submitted and eligible for funding in FY 1993. The total amount
of funding that remains available under this FY 1994 NOFA is $11,940,611. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection of applications for funding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to be considered for funding, an application must be complete and must meet the threshold criteria set forth
in Section II.B. of this NOFA. As such, it is required that the proposed risk assessment be for pre-1980 family developments.
Additionally, the Department has determined that a development(s) targeted within an application, will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be eligible for funding where a development has been: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tested and abated; OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tested and the results were negative; OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tested, results were positive and an adequate in-place management plan has been developed; OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The subject of a risk assessment previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In these instances, the Department recognizes that hazards have been addressed or identified; thus, there is no need
to conduct a risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where a development is eligible to be the subject of a complete risk assessment, in accordance with the threshold criteria
set forth in Section II.B. of this NOFA, the HA shall base its funding request on a per-unit-to-be-sampled-per-development
cost. The per-unit cost must include costs for collection of dust and soil samples, collection of paint chip samples
(where necessary), administration, laboratory analysis of collected paint, dust and soil samples, interpretation
of laboratory results on samples collected, review of maintenance and management practices, and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
development 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(not the implementation) of recommendations for in-place management. It is noted that while the risk assessment
includes soil testing for lead contamination, a level of hazard for lead in soil has not been set. That issue is currently
being examined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Once the results of the soil tests have been completed
and forwarded to the Department (copies of the results must be sent to the appropriate Field Office upon completion)
they will be gathered by the Department and provided to EPA. The Department will defer to EPA for the establishment
of a hazard level determination and for guidance to housing authorities for action where such levels are exceeded.
However, where State or local laws have established lead-in-soil standards and require action, HAs shall abide by
the State or local requirements. Costs associated with remediating soil are not eligible for funding under this NOFA.
Funding of such costs must be secured from other HA sources (i.e., CIAP, CGP, operating subsidy, operating reserves,
or State/local contributions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost-per-unit-to-be-sampled may not exceed the amount of $495. Prior year funding indicates that a number of
HAs were able to complete risk assessments at less than this amount (ranging from $250 to $350 per-unit-to-be-sampled,
excluding HA administrative costs). HAs are strongly encouraged to budget prudently for these costs. Where this
amount is exceeded, the HA must submit justification of the amount requested, and the Field Office will examine the
cost reasonableness of such request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method to be used to determine the number of units to be sampled is set forth below and in the risk assessment protocol,
which, at a minimum, must be used by HAs funded under this NOFA:

Funds will be assigned to the HUD Area Offices. In assigning funds to the Area Office, Headquarters will designate
an amount to be subassigned to each Indian and non-Indian Field Office. These amounts are based on the estimated sample
size of pre-1980 family units minus the number of units previously funded in Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, within each
Field Office.

As many eligible applications as possible will be funded within the available Field Office allocation of funds. If
after fully funding all eligible applications within its jurisdiction a Field Office has funds remaining from its

the funds based on remaining needs in other Field Offices. Headquarters will redistribute funds from Field Offices
that do not have enough fundable applications, to other Field Offices that have insufficient funds for fundable applications.

Subassignment of funds to non-Indian and Indian Field Offices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remaining funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event that the funds awarded under this NOFA total less than the amount available, the remaining amount will
be carried over to FY 1995, because the Appropriations Act specifically targets these funds for the assessment of
risks associated with lead-based paint. If funds are carried over to FY 1995, a subsequent NOFA for these remaining
set-aside funds will be published.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Eligibility and Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) All HAs with pre-1980 family developments are eligible (i.e., both large HAs funded under the Comprehensive Grant
Program (CGP) and small HAs funded under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP)). Specific developments
targeted for funding within an application must meet the requirements set forth in Section II.B. of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HAs, especially smaller ones, are encouraged to form a consortium for purposes of having risk assessments conducted.
Such a consortium would enable a number of HAs to obtain coordinated services for those risk assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In accordance with section 14(a)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) (added by the 1992 Appropriations
Act, 105 Stat. 759), pre-1980 family developments within a HA's inventory may be the subject of a LBP risk assessment.
As stated in section 14(a)(3), risk assessments are intended ``to assess the risks of lead-based paint poisoning
*&blank;*&blank;* in all projects constructed before 1980 that are, or will be, occupied by families.'' Risk assessments
are not mandatory; however, HAs are strongly encouraged to conduct them. In undertaking a risk assessment, a HA shall
use a risk assessment protocol that, at a minimum, follows the Department's protocol. Upon completion of the risk
assessment, the HA must provide a copy of the results of the risk assessment to the appropriate Field Office. The risk
assessment must be completed within eighteen (18) months of HUD's fund reservation notification to the HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the scope of the risk assessment may exceed the contents of the Department's protocol, funding shall be requested
based on this protocol. The goal of the protocol is to enable a HA to identify lead hazards so that appropriate in-place
management can be implemented until testing and abatement can be fully undertaken. Section 14(a)(3) of the 1937 Act
requires that professional risk assessments include dust and soil sampling and laboratory analysis. The risk assessment
protocol has been developed by the Department to ensure compliance with this provision and with certain requirements
of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs are expected to implement the in-place management recommendations resulting from the completed risk assessment,
especially in cases where abatement will not be undertaken within a reasonable timeframe (one year). However, actual
implementation of recommendations that result from the risk assessment conducted is not eligible for funding under
this NOFA. The implementation of resulting recommendations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, comprehensive or random testing, abatement of lead, in-place management measures, and work order modifications)
may be funded from other HA sources (i.e., CIAP, CGP, operating subsidy, operating reserves or State/local contributions).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In no instance shall the implementation of in-place management measures satisfy the HA's obligation under the Lead-Based
Paint Poisoning Prevention Act to abate lead-based paint hazards, rather they are interim measures to be used until
testing and/or full abatement can be undertaken, as appropriate. Similarly, in no instance shall conducting a risk
assessment satisfy the HA's obligation under the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act to test for and abate
lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) CIAP requirements, as set forth in 24 CFR part 968, subpart B, and the CIAP Handbook, 7485.1 REV&hyph;4, are applicable
to HAs funded under this NOFA. These requirements encompass implementation schedules, progress reports, budget
revisions, requests for extensions, closeouts, etc. Fund requisitions are to be processed through the LOCCS/VRS
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HAs must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 85 for the procurement of risk assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In accepting funding to perform a risk assessment, HAs must agree to participate, if requested by HUD, in a subsequent
evaluation of the risk assessment protocol. This evaluation will entail a review of collected sampling data and the
effectiveness of recommended in-place management procedures.

C. Ineligible Costs and Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) A specific development targeted within an application is not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligible for funding, in accordance with the threshold requirements set forth in Section II.B. of this NOFA, where
the development has been: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tested and abated; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Tested, results were positive, but an adequate in-place management plan has been developed; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The subject of a risk assessment previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Actual implementation of recommendations that result from the risk assessment conducted is not eligible for
funding under this NOFA. The implementation of resulting recommendations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 comprehensive or random testing, abatement of lead, in-place management measures, and work order modifications)
may be funded from other HA sources (i.e., CIAP, CGP, operating subsidy, or operating reserves). HAs are expected
to implement these recommendations, especially those related to in-place management measures when abatement of
lead hazards will not take place within a reasonable time (one year). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In no instance shall the implementation of in-place management measures satisfy the HA's obligation under the Lead-Based
Paint Poisoning Prevention Act to test and/or abate lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Funds under this NOFA may not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be used to purchase insurance including existing-conditions LBP liability insurance. While funds may be used to
conduct risk assessments required to be in place prior to the issuance of an insurance policy, under no circumstance
may these funds be used to pay for the premiums associated with this insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Selection of Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Applications will be selected for funding only after they have been deemed eligible in accordance with the threshold
requirements set forth in Section II.B. of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Field Offices will ensure that all applications (including copies) are date- and time-stamped immediately upon
receipt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Decisions for funding are to be made known to Headquarters by the date specified in the Processing Schedule in Section
III.B of this NOFA. The Field Office will be responsible for identifying, notifying applicants of, and receiving
corrections of any technical deficiencies in the application, as discussed in Section IV of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Field Office Public Housing Division Director shall make final funding decisions on the amounts assigned
to each Field Office. As many applications as possible will be funded within the Field allocation or any redistribution
of funds. Each Field Office will advise Headquarters, by the date specified in the Processing Schedule in Section
III.B of this NOFA, on whether there are sufficient eligible applications within its jurisdiction to require all
of the funds assigned. In cases where all assigned funds cannot be used within a Field Office's jurisdiction, Headquarters
will reassign the funds to other Field Offices that have identified a need for additional funds, as described in Section
I.A(4) of this NOFA.

IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediately after the submission of an application, the appropriate Field Office will screen the application to
determine whether all items were submitted. If items 1, 2, and 3 listed in Section III.A, Application Content, of this
NOFA are missing, the application will be considered substantially incomplete and, therefore, ineligible for processing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the HA fails to submit any of items 4&hyph;12 listed in Section III.A of this NOFA, or the application contains a technical
mistake, such as an incorrect signatory, the Field Office will immediately notify the HA that it has 14 calendar days
from the date of HUD's written notification to submit or correct the specified items. If any of items 4&hyph;12 are

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The finding
of no significant impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.

B. Federalism Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review
under the Order. The NOFA merely sets forth funding availability for HAs to conduct, at their discretion, risk assessments
for lead paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Family Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that this notice will likely have a beneficial impact on family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. Families could benefit from this funding action as a result of the identification of immediate and potential
lead-based paint hazards; that identification will ultimately lead to a safer environment. However, since the impact
on the family is not necessarily significant and is beneficial, no further review is considered necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) is codified as 24 CFR part 4 and applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements
of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD) (this is not
a toll-free number). The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However,
a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with
persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel
for the program to which the question pertains.

F. Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b), added by section 112 of the Reform
Act, contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance.
The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others
to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

G. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
The Department has determined that an IHA established by an Indian Tribe as a result of the exercise of its sovereign
power is not subject to the Byrd Amendment, but an IHA established under State law is subject to those requirements
and prohibitions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces that EPA will hold a public meeting on Wednesday, July 27, 1994 in Washington, D.C. which will
be devoted to environmental auditing policy, and the related issues of self-evaluation and disclosure. The focus
of the meeting, to be chaired by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, will be to
consider the need for reinforcing or modifying the Agency's existing policy on environmental auditing. The Agency
is providing this forum for the regulated community and other interested parties to present views on whether additional
incentives are needed to encourage the self-disclosure and prompt correction of environmental violations uncovered
during facility audits.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a memorandum dated May 13, 1994, Assistant Administrator Steven A. Herman announced that, in response to the request
of Administrator Browner, the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) will coordinate a reassessment
of EPA's current policy regarding environmental auditing and self-evaluation by the regulated community. OECA
will seek to ensure that any decision either to reinforce or to change existing policy on environmental auditing is
informed by fact. Therefore, the approach to the upcoming evaluation of auditing policy can best be characterized
as an empirical information-gathering effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is committed to investigating the perceived problems relating to auditing and self-disclosure. The Agency must,
however, develop a sufficient information base in order to give serious consideration to any policy options. EPA
hopes to collect such relevant data through implementation of four actions this summer: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA will convene the public meeting described in this notice as an opportunity for the Agency to obtain a wide variety
of views and to sharpen the focus on these issues. The range of issues appropriate for discussion at the public meeting
is outlined under ``Agenda/Focus Topics'' section below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Prior to the public meeting, EPA expects to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a restatement of the Agency's current audit policy. The most recent policy statement on environmental auditing was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 14, 1986, at 51 FR 25004. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a companion notice soliciting proposals for the Environmental Leadership Program (ELP) pilot projects. EPA expects
that the ELP pilot projects will generate useful data on auditing methodology and measures. The ELP projects may serve
as vehicles for experimenting with policy-driven incentives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Finally, EPA will encourage the private sector to collect data and survey auditing practices in order to gauge the
effect of enforcement policies on self-evaluation and disclosure in the regulated community.

II. Agenda/Focus Topics for Public Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is providing this forum for the regulated community and other interested parties to present argument and
evidence as to whether additional incentives are needed to encourage the self-disclosure and prompt correction
of environmental violations uncovered during facility audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is particularly interested in receiving information relating to the implementation of EPA's 1986 Environmental
Auditing Policy Statement. To date, the Agency has received only anecdotal reports relating to the use of the policy
by Federal inspectors and prosecutors and their State and local counterparts. EPA is interested in specific information,
supported with documentation, about both the successes and failures associated with the implementation of the 1986
policy. Matters that involved, or should have involved, penalty mitigation are especially relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the public meeting, EPA will encourage discussion of specific suggestions for auditing policy options. The presentation
of evidence supporting the viability of these options will be given priority. This forum presents an opportunity
for the Agency to establish a dialogue with the regulated community on ways to provide increased recognition and greater
certainty of enforcement response (through penalty mitigation or other mechanisms) for self-disclosure and correction
of violations discovered through auditing. EPA is particularly interested in options which adapt existing mechanisms
or policies, and which expand the approaches used in current EPA self-disclosure/penalty reduction programs (e.g.,
the Compliance Audit Program under section 8(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four States (Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, and Oregon) have recently enacted legislation which, with some variations,
creates a ``self-evaluative'' privilege for audit reports. EPA has consistently opposed this approach, principally
because of the risk of weakening State enforcement programs, the imposition of unnecessary transaction costs and
delays in enforcement actions, and the potential increase in the number of situations requiring the expenditure
of scarce Agency resources, including the ``overfiling'' of State enforcement actions. EPA urges States that are
considering a privilege-oriented approach to actively participate in the comprehensive process described in this
notice before pursuing any legislative action. The Agency also encourages States that have passed such legislation
to present documentary justification for this approach at the public meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that significant interest exists with regard to the potential use of auditing results in criminal
enforcement. Discussion of the relationship of auditing to criminal sanctions is therefore appropriate at the public
meeting. Relevant background information includes the Department of Justice document entitled, ``Factors in Decisions
on Criminal Prosecutions for Environmental Violations in the Context of Significant Voluntary Compliance or Disclosure
Efforts by the Violator,'' dated July 1, 1991, and the EPA memorandum on ``The Exercise of Investigative Discretion,''
from Earl E. Devaney, Director, Office of Criminal Enforcement, dated January 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, EPA is interested in discussion of advances in the field of auditing since 1986; any revision of auditing policy
should reflect more recent trends and developments in the auditing field. At the public meeting, discussion may include
the potential applicability of concepts relating to auditing and environmental management systems incorporated
into the Draft Corporate Sentencing Guidelines for Environmental Violations, dated November 16, 1993, as well as
evolving international auditing and management standards. Finally, comment is expected on the potential role of
the Environmental Leadership Program pilot projects in promoting auditing practices or implementing auditing
policy.
