SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management is adopting as final the interim regulations authorizing payment of a separate
maintenance allowance to Federal civilian employees assigned to Johnston Island, a nonforeign post of duty dedicated
to chemical weapon storage and disposal facilities. A separate maintenance allowance assists an employee in meeting
some of the additional expenses of maintaining a spouse and/or dependents elsewhere who would normally reside with
the employee. The final regulations provide for determining which employees are eligible for the separate maintenance
allowance, which relatives qualify as dependents, the method of payment, and the payment amounts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published an interim rule on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51565). The 30-day public
comment period ended on November 3, 1993. No comments were received on the interim rule; therefore, OPM is adopting
as final the interim rule implementing section 1092 of Public Law 102&hyph;190, December 5, 1991 (the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993). Section 1092 amended chapter 59 of title 5, United States Code,
by adding section 5942a to provide a separate maintenance allowance to assist an employee assigned to Johnston Island
to meet the additional expenses of maintaining a spouse and/or dependents elsewhere who would normally reside with
the employee. On November 16, 1992, this regulatory authority was delegated to OPM by Executive Order 12822.

The final regulations provide procedures and rules under which the head of the agency may determine eligibility for
a separate maintenance allowance and the appropriate payment amount. The regulations define: (1) Dependents, (2)
the annual rate to be paid to an employee according to the number of his or her dependents, (3) the method of payment,
and (4) the responsibilities of the agencies and OPM.

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Hartzell Propeller Inc. Model HC&hyph;E4A&hyph;3A/E10950()
composite bladed propellers installed on but not limited to Beech Model 1900D aircraft. This action requires installation
of new propeller blade pitch change knob twelve point flange head attachment bolts, new preload plates, and new propeller
blade pitch change knob brackets. This amendment is prompted by reports of 15 propeller blade pitch change knob screw
failures found during routine maintenance. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a severe propeller
vibration in flight and possible loss of propeller pitch control.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received reports of 15 propeller blade pitch change knob screw failures
found during routine maintenance on Hartzell Propeller Inc. Model HC&hyph;E4A&hyph;3A/E10950() composite bladed
propellers installed on but not limited to Beech Model 1900D aircraft. The FAA also received pilot reports of vibration
and unusual propeller noise, and additional reports of several incidents when the propeller would not go completely
into the feather position after engine shutdown on the ground. Investigation into these incidents revealed a failed
screw head had lodged in the internal pitch change mechanism. Investigation further reveals that the screws failed
due to high cycle fatigue. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a severe propeller vibration in flight
and possible loss of propeller pitch control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Hartzell Propeller Inc. Alert Service Bulletin (ASB)
No. A190, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures for installation of new propeller blade pitch change
knob twelve point flange head attachment bolts to replace the countersunk screws currently used, new preload plates,
and new propeller blade pitch change knob brackets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Hartzell Propeller Inc. Model
HC&hyph;E4A&hyph;3A/E10950() composite bladed propellers of the same type design, this airworthiness directive
(AD) is being issued to prevent a severe propeller vibration in flight and possible loss of propeller pitch control.
This AD requires installation of a design change to the propeller pitch change knob attachment. This installation
consists of new propeller blade pitch change knob twelve point flange head attachment bolts to replace the countersunk
screws currently used, new preload plates, and new propeller blade pitch change knob brackets. Propellers with serial
numbers HJ199 and greater are excluded from this AD, as the propellers were modified during manufacturing. The actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;05.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Beech Model 400A and 400T airplanes, that requires inspection to detect damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the wire harness in the wheel well of the main landing gear (MLG), and modification, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of damage to wire harnesses due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abrasion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel supply to the engine or loss of control of the retraction/extension system for the MLG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and MLG door.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5965). That action proposed to require inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to detect damage of the wire harness in the wheel well of the main landing gear (MLG), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modification, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 59 Model 400A and 400T airplanes of the affected design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $5,060, or $110 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Model A300 series airplanes,
that requires modification of certain evacuation door slides. This amendment is prompted by a report that, during
flight crew training, the toe end of the slide lane tore. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent damage
to the slide, which could render the slide unusable, contribute to injury of passengers on the slide, and delay or impede
the evacuation of passengers during an emergency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5964). That action proposed to require modification of certain evacuation door slides.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there are no Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes equipped with BFGoodrich evacuation door slides
on the U.S. register. However, should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future,
the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 6.2 work hours per slide to accomplish the required actions, and
that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by BFGoodrich at no cost to the operators.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD would be $341 per slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes,
that requires modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure. This amendment is prompted by results
of a stress analysis check, which revealed that the factor of safety of the aileron drive quadrant support structure
on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength requirements specified in the
Federal Aviation Regulations. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent cracking of the support structure,
which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Jetstream 4101 airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5359). That action proposed to require modification of the aileron drive quadrant support
structure below the flight compartment floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $1,100 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 This document contains the final regulations relating to the circumstances in which a party shall be deemed to have
exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of the recovery
of court costs and certain fees in a civil tax proceeding brought in a court of the United States (including the Tax Court
and the Court of Federal Claims). These regulations differ from the final regulations previously issued under section
7430, which were effective for civil tax proceedings commenced after February 28, 1983, and before January 1, 1986,
and addressed the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement for recovery of litigation costs incurred
by taxpayers with respect to a court proceeding in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any
tax, interest, or penalty. Portions of the final regulations previously issued under section 7430 were held to be
invalid by the United States Tax Court in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code
(the Code) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19828 [IA&hyph;003&hyph;89, 1992&hyph;1 C.B. 1100]). The amendments were issued under the authority
contained in section 7805 of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One public comment was received concerning these regulations. After consideration of the public comment received,
the proposed regulations are adopted, as revised by this Treasury decision.

Explanation of Regulatory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, under section 7430 of the Code, a prevailing party may recover the reasonable litigation costs incurred
in a civil proceeding if the proceeding relates to the determination, collection or refund of any tax, interest or
penalty under the Internal Revenue Code and the party has exhausted all the administrative remedies related to that
party's tax matter. These final regulations provide information concerning the circumstances in which a party's
administrative remedies shall be deemed to have been exhausted. In general, administrative remedies are deemed
to have been exhausted if the party has requested (and if granted, participated in) an Appeals office conference on
the party's tax matter prior to filing an action in a court of the United States (including the Tax Court and the Court
of Federal Claims). A party has participated in an Appeals office conference if the party has disclosed all relevant
information regarding the matter to the Appeals office. In the case of the revocation of a determination that an organization
is described in section 501(c)(3), a party must complete the procedures set forth in section 7428 and in regulations,
rules and revenue procedures thereunder to exhaust its administrative remedies. Where no administrative procedure
covering a party's tax matter allows the party to request an Appeals office conference, the party's administrative
remedies will not be deemed to have been exhausted unless the party has filed a written claim for relief with the district
director having jurisdiction over the tax matter and allowed the district director a reasonable period of time to
act on the claim. A party is not required to pursue its administrative remedies if the Internal Revenue Service has
notified the party in writing that such pursuit is unnecessary, has not given the party an opportunity to request an
Appeals office conference before sending a statutory notice of deficiency, or has failed to grant the party an Appeals
office conference with respect to a claim for refund within six months of the filing of such claim for refund. A party
must participate in an Appeals office conference during either the deficiency procedures or the refund procedures
with respect to the tax matter, but is not required to participate during both procedures. Thus, if a party participated
in an Appeals office conference with respect to a tax matter prior to the issuance of the statutory notice of deficiency,
the party does not need to request an Appeals office conference after filing a claim for refund with respect to the same
tax matter.

Comments on the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One public comment objected to, and requested deletion of, the requirement that a party request (and if granted, participate
in) an Appeals office conference on the party's tax matter prior to filing an action in a court of the United States (including
the Tax Court and the Court of Federal Claims). This suggestion was not adopted in the final regulations because conferences
with Appeals have historically been a fundamental method for providing administrative remedies to taxpayers who
do not agree with the Internal Revenue Service. Such remedies are pivotal to the effort to resolve issues promptly,
efficiently, fairly and without resort to litigation. In order to avoid costly litigation consistent with the legislative
intent and to encourage usage of this process to resolve disputes, the regulations require taxpayers, in order to
be deemed to have exhausted their administrative remedies, to pursue such remedies with the Appeals office, if available,
prior to instituting litigation.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice
of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment
on their impact on small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer A exchanges property held for investment for similar property and claims that the gain on the exchange is
not recognized under section 1031. The Internal Revenue Service conducts a field examination and determines that
there has not been a like-kind exchange. No agreement is reached on the matter and a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day
letter) is sent to A. A does not file a request for an Appeals office conference. A pays the amount of the proposed deficiency
and files a claim for refund. A notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service. A does not
request an Appeals office conference and, instead, files a civil action for refund in a United States District Court.
A has not exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

office conference and files a civil action for refund in a United States District Court. A has exhausted the administrative
remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

all relevant legal arguments supporting the taxpayer's position. B properly requests an Appeals office conference.
The Appeals office, to obtain an additional period of time to consider the tax matter, requests that B sign Form 872
to extend the time for an assessment of tax, but B declines. Appeals then denies the request for a conference and issues
a notice of deficiency. B has exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

On January 2, the Internal Revenue Service serves a summons issued under section 7609 on third-party recordkeeper
D to produce records of taxpayer E. On January 5, notice of the summons is given to E. The last day on which E may file a petition
in a court of the United States to quash the summons is January 25. Thereafter, E files a written claim for relief with
the district director having jurisdiction over the matter together with a copy of the summons. The claim and copy are
received by the district director on January 20. On January 25, E files a petition to quash the summons. E has exhausted
the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

A notice of Federal tax lien is filed in County M on March 3, in the name of F. On April 2, F pays the entire liability thereby
satisfying the lien. On May 2, F files a written claim with the district director having jurisdiction over the tax matter
demanding a certificate of release of lien. Thereafter, F provides the district director with a copy of the notice
of Federal tax lien and a copy of the canceled check in satisfaction of the lien, which are received by the district director
on May 15. F's claim is deemed to have been filed on May 15. Accordingly, F must wait until after July 14 (60 days following
the filing of the claim for relief on May 15) to commence an action, in order to have exhausted the administrative remedies
available within the Internal Revenue Service.

A revenue officer seizes an automobile to effect collection of G's liability on January 10. On January 22, H submits
a written claim to the district director having jurisdiction over the tax matter claiming that H purchased the automobile
from G for an adequate consideration before the tax lien against G arose, and demands immediate return of the automobile.
A copy of the title certificate and H's canceled check are submitted with the claim. The claim is received by the district
director on January 25. On January 30, H brings a wrongful levy action. H has exhausted the administrative remedies
available within the Internal Revenue Service.

Example 9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service issues a revenue ruling which holds that ear piercing does not affect a function or structure
of the body within the meaning of section 213 and therefore is not deductible. Taxpayer I deducts the costs of ear piercing
and, following an examination, receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter) disallowing the treatment
of such costs. Because of the revenue ruling, I believes a conference would not aid in the resolution of the tax dispute.
Accordingly, I does not request an Appeals office conference. After receiving a statutory notice of deficiency,
I files a petition in the Tax Court. I has not exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal
Revenue Service. The issuance of a revenue ruling covering the same fact situation but taking a contrary position
does not constitute notification by the Internal Revenue Service to I that the pursuit of administrative remedies
is unnecessary. Similarly, the issuance to I of a private letter ruling or technical advice does not constitute notification
by the Internal Revenue Service that the pursuit of administrative remedies is unnecessary.

Taxpayer J is assessed a penalty under section 6701 for aiding in the understatement of the tax liability of another
person. J pays 15% of the penalty in accordance with section 6703 and files a claim for refund on June 15. J is not issued
a notice of proposed disallowance and thus cannot participate in an Appeals office conference within six months of
the filing of the claim for refund. J brings an action on December 23. J has exhausted the administrative remedies available
within the Internal Revenue Service.

statutory notice, and after filing a petition with the Tax Court, K requests an Appeals office conference. K has not
exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service because the request for an
Appeals office conference was made after the issuance of the statutory notice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains the final regulations relating to the recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred
by taxpayers in connection with an administrative proceeding within the Internal Revenue Service. Changes to the
applicable law were made by section 6239(a) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA) (Pub. L.
No. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3342). These regulations affect all taxpayers involved in an administrative proceeding
within the Internal Revenue Service, and provide guidance regarding the definition of reasonable administrative
costs and the period within which the costs must be incurred in order to be recoverable. These regulations also set
forth the requirements and procedures for the recovery of such costs, and the definitions of prevailing party, administrative
proceeding and administrative proceeding date. A table of contents to the regulations under section 7430 is provided
in &sect;301.7430&hyph;0.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed additions to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 301) under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code
(the Code) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 23, 1992 (57 FR 61020 [IA&hyph;003&hyph;89, 1993&hyph;1 C.B. 789]). These proposed additions were issued
under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code. A summary of the proposed additions is contained in the preamble
that was published with the proposed additions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No changes have been made to the proposed regulations. One public comment objected to the failure of the regulations
to provide for the recovery of amounts expended by taxpayers during the examination of their returns. As section 7430
does not provide for such awards, this suggestion was not adopted. After consideration of the public comment received,
the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice
of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment
on their impact on small business.

Introduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 7430(a)(1) provides for the recovery, under certain circumstances, of reasonable administrative costs
incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service. Paragraph (b) of
this section lists the requirements that a taxpayer must meet to be entitled to an award of reasonable administrative
costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Internal Revenue Service will grant a taxpayer's request for recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred
in connection with an administrative proceeding under section 7430 and this section only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The underlying substantive issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before
any court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction
over those issues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable administrative costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The costs were reasonable administrative costs as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;4; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prevailing party.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The taxpayer is a prevailing party as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;5; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Not unreasonably protracted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The administrative proceeding was not unreasonably protracted by the taxpayer as discussed in paragraph (d) of this
section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedural requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The taxpayer follows the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination by court.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for reasonable administrative costs where the requirements
of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, a taxpayer may file a claim for reasonable administrative costs
with the court with jurisdiction over the judicial proceeding. The court may award the taxpayer reasonable administrative
costs under section 7430(a). Under section 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii), where the final determination with respect to the
tax, interest, or penalty at issue is made by a court, the court determines whether the taxpayer qualifies as a prevailing
party. Thus, where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, the taxpayer's only possibility
of obtaining an award of reasonable administrative costs is to obtain an award of such costs from the court. In the event
the court awards reasonable administrative costs, it may also award litigation costs for the reasonable costs of
pursuing the claim for reasonable administrative costs, provided the requirements under section 7430 regarding
an award of reasonable administrative costs are satisfied with respect to such costs. A claim filed with the court
should be made in accordance with the rules of the court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for recovering reasonable administrative costs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service will not award administrative costs under section 7430 unless the taxpayer files a written
request to recover reasonable administrative costs in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

the taxpayer making the request, the taxpayer may send the request to the District Director for the district that considered
the underlying matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of Request.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No specific form is required for the request other than one which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of
this section. Where practicable the required statements may be included in a single document. Similarly, where practicable,
the required affidavits may be combined in a single affidavit to the extent they are to be executed by the same person.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Period for requesting costs from the Internal Revenue Service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To recover reasonable administrative costs pursuant to section 7430 and this section, the taxpayer must file a request
for costs no later than 90 days after the date the final decision of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to all
tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding is mailed, or otherwise furnished,
to the taxpayer. The final decision of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of this section is the document which
resolves the tax liability of the taxpayer with regard to all tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue in the administrative
proceeding (such as a Form 870 or closing agreement), or a notice of assessment for that liability (such as the notice
and demand under section 6303), whichever is earlier mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the taxpayer. For purposes
of this section, if the 90th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the 90-day period shall end on the next
succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The term legal holiday means a legal holiday in the
District of Columbia. If the request for costs is to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at an office of the Internal
Revenue Service located outside the District of Columbia but within an internal revenue district, the term legal
holiday also means a Statewide legal holiday in the State where such office is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Internal Revenue Service is authorized, but not required, to notify the taxpayer of its decision to grant or deny
(in whole or in part) an award for reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by certified
mail or registered mail. If the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to a request by the taxpayer
for an award of reasonable administrative costs filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 6 months after
such request is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond may be considered by the taxpayer as a decision
of the Internal Revenue Service denying an award for reasonable administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Appeal to Tax Court.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A taxpayer may appeal a decision by the Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for reasonable
administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by filing a petition for reasonable administrative costs
with the Tax Court. The petition must be in accordance with the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure and must
be filed with the Tax Court after the Internal Revenue Service denies (in whole or in part) the taxpayer's request for
reasonable administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unreasonable protraction of administrative proceeding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An award of reasonable administrative costs will not be made where the taxpayer unreasonably protracted the administrative
proceeding. However, a taxpayer that unreasonably protracted only a portion of the administrative proceeding,
but not other portions of the administrative proceeding, may recover reasonable administrative costs for the portion(s)
of the administrative proceeding that the taxpayer did not unreasonably protract, if the requirements of paragraph
(b)(1) of this section are otherwise satisfied.

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration.
Appeals requests that A submit certain documents as substantiation for the tax matters at issue. Although A complies
with this request, the information is misdirected and not considered by Appeals. Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency.
A does not file a petition with the Tax Court. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A convinces Appeals that the
notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. Appeals then closes the case showing a zero deficiency and
mails A a notice to this effect. Assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied, A may recover reasonable
administrative costs incurred after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date).
To recover these costs, A must file a request for costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled A's tax matter,
or if that person is unknown to A, with the District Director of the district which considered the underlying matter,
within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that A owes no tax.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that after receipt of the notice of deficiency, A meets with an Appeals officer, but no agreement is reached
on the tax matters at issue. A then files a petition with the Tax Court and prevails. Since the underlying tax issues
have been determined by a court, the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for recovery of the reasonable
administrative costs incurred by A. To recover reasonable administrative costs, A must file a claim with the Tax Court
as prescribed under the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure.

Administrative proceeding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 7430, an administrative proceeding generally means any procedure or other action before
the Internal Revenue Service that is commenced after November 10, 1988. However, an administrative proceeding does
not include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Proceedings involving matters of general application, including hearings on regulations, comments on forms,
or proceedings involving revenue rulings or revenue procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proceedings involving requests for private letter rulings or similar determinations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Proceedings involving technical advice memoranda, except those submitted after the administrative proceeding
date (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Proceedings in connection with collection actions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), including proceedings
under sections 7432 or 7433.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collection action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A collection action generally includes any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax (or any interest,
additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax) or any action taken
by a taxpayer in response to the Internal Revenue Service's act or failure to act in connection with the collection
of a tax (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition
to the tax). For example, a collection action for purposes of section 7430 and this section includes any action taken
by the Internal Revenue Service under Chapter 64 of Subtitle F to collect a tax. Collection actions also include those
actions taken by a taxpayer to remedy the Internal Revenue Service's failure to release a lien under section 6325 and
to remedy any unauthorized collection action as defined by section 7433. However, an action or procedure directly
relating to a claim for refund filed with the Service Center's Collection Branch or District Director's Collection
Division after payment of an assessed tax is not a collection action.

General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, the term administrative proceeding date means the earlier
of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date of the notice of deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service
Office of Appeals is the final written document, mailed or delivered to the taxpayer, that is signed by an individual
in the Office of Appeals who has been delegated the authority to settle the dispute on behalf of the Commissioner, and
states or indicates that the notice is the final determination of the entire case. A notice of claim disallowance issued
by the Office of Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. Solely for purposes
of determining the administrative proceeding date, a notice of deficiency issued by the Office of Appeals is not a
notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of deficiency. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of deficiency is a notice described in section 6212(a), including a notice rescinded pursuant to section
6212(d). For purposes of determining reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder,
a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment described in section 6223(a)(2) will be treated as a notice
of deficiency. A notice of final S corporation administrative adjustment issued pursuant to section 6223(a)(2)
as made applicable to subchapter S items by section 6244 will also be treated as a notice of deficiency.

Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals
office conference. At the conference, an agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. A cannot recover any costs
because they were not incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date, which is the earlier of the date of receipt
by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, or the date of the notice
of deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). B pays the amount of the proposed deficiency
and files a claim for refund. B's claim is disallowed and a notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the District
Director. B does not request an Appeals office conference and the District Director issues a notice of claim disallowance.
B then files suit in a United States District Court. B cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because, although
the District Director issued a notice of claim disallowance, the Internal Revenue Service did not issue either a notice
of decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals or a notice of deficiency.

except that after B files a claim for refund and receives the notice of proposed disallowance, B requests and is granted
Appeals office consideration. No agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a notice of claim
disallowance. B does not file suit in District Court but instead contacts the Appeals office to attempt to reverse
the decision. B convinces the Appeals officer that the notice of claim disallowance is in error. The Appeals officer
then abates the assessment. Because a notice of claim disallowance issued by Appeals is a notice of the decision of
the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, B may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after
the receipt of the notice of claim disallowance (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the other requirements
of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. B cannot recover the costs incurred prior to receipt
of the notice of claim disallowance because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date.

Instead, C pays the deficiency and files a claim for refund. The claim for refund is considered by the Internal Revenue
Service and the District Director issues a notice of proposed disallowance. C requests and is granted Appeals office
consideration. C convinces Appeals that C's claim is correct and Appeals allows C's claim. C may recover reasonable
administrative costs incurred on or after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date),
but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied.

Taxpayer E files an individual income tax return showing a balance due. No payment is made with the return and the Internal
Revenue Service assesses the amount shown on the return. The Internal Revenue Service issues a notice and demand for
tax pursuant to section 6303. E contacts the Collection Division (Collection) regarding E's outstanding liability.
No agreement is reached with respect to the timing of E's payment, and Collection issues a notice of intent to levy pursuant
to section 6331(d). Prior to the levy, E enters into an installment agreement with Collection. The costs that E incurred
in connection with the notice and demand were not incurred in an administrative proceeding, but rather in a collection
action. Accordingly, E may not recover those costs as reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the
regulations thereunder.

Appeals considers the issues and decides to uphold Collection's recommended assessment. Appeals notifies F of this
decision in writing. Collection then assesses the tax. Pursuant to section 6672(b), within 30 days after the notice
and demand is made, F pays the minimum amount required to commence a court proceeding, files a claim for refund, and
furnishes the required bond. Collection then considers and disallows the claim. Appeals then reconsiders the claim
and reverses its original position, thus upholding F's position. Appeals then abates the assessment. F may recover
reasonable administrative costs incurred after the receipt of the original decision of Appeals (the administrative
proceeding date) that Appeals was upholding Collection's recommended assessment, but only if the other requirements
of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. F cannot recover costs that are attributable to any
procedure or other action before Collection prior to filing F's administrative claim for refund.

Representative and specially qualified representative_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A representative is a person compensated for services rendered in connection with the administrative proceeding,
who is authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service or the Tax Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specially qualified representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a specially qualified representative is
a representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) possessing a distinctive knowledge or a unique
and specialized skill that is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer in the proceeding. Examples of a unique
and specialized skill or distinctive knowledge would be an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law or
knowledge of a foreign law or language where such specialty or knowledge is necessary to adequately represent the
taxpayer in the proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, neither knowledge of tax law nor experience in representing
taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service is considered distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill.
An extraordinary level of general representational knowledge and ability that is useful in all proceedings is not
considered, in and of itself, distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill. Specially qualified representatives
also do not include those who have a distinctive knowledge of the underlying subject matter of the controversy in circumstances
where such distinctive knowledge could reasonably be supplied through the use of an expert, or could readily be obtained
through literature pertaining to the subject.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as otherwise provided in this section, fees described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section that are recoverable
under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder as reasonable administrative costs may not exceed $75 per hour
increased by a cost of living adjustment (and if appropriate, a special factor adjustment).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service will make a cost of living adjustment to the $75 per hour limit by using the Consumer Price
Index of All-Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U) published by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics and referenced
in Internal Revenue Code section 1(f)(5). If the CPI&hyph;U is no longer published, a comparable index will be used,
and any reference in this section to the CPI&hyph;U will be considered to refer to such comparable index.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Percentage adjustment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the base year for determining the cost of living adjustment
is the calendar year 1986. The cost of living adjustment for fees incurred in any calendar year subsequent to 1986 is
the percentage (if any) by which the yearly average CPI&hyph;U for the calendar year immediately prior to the year
in which the fees are incurred exceeds the January CPI&hyph;U for the calendar year 1986.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the presence of a special factor is demonstrated by the taxpayer, the amount reimbursable is the amount of reasonable
fees paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the proceeding for the services of a representative as defined
in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special factor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A special factor is a factor, other than an increase in the cost of living, which justifies an increase in the $75 per
hour limitation of section 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii). The novelty and difficulty of the issues, the undesirability of
the case, the work and the ability of counsel, the results obtained, and customary fees and awards in other cases, are
factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation and do not constitute special factors for the purpose of increasing
the $75 per hour limitation. The limited availability of a specially qualified representative for the proceeding
does constitute a special factor justifying an increase in the $75 per hour limitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limited availability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless disputed by the Internal Revenue Service, limited availability of a specially qualified representative
is established by demonstrating that a specially qualified representative for the proceeding is not available at
the $75 per hour rate (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living). Initially, this showing may be made by submission
of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by the taxpayer's counsel, that in a case similar to the taxpayer's, a specially
qualified representative that practices within a reasonable distance from the taxpayer's principal residence
or principal office would normally charge a client similar to the taxpayer at a rate in excess of this amount. If the
Internal Revenue Service challenges this initial showing, the taxpayer may submit additional evidence to establish
the limited availability of a specially qualified representative at the rate specified above.

Example.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer A is represented by B, a CPA and attorney with an LL.M. Degree in Taxation with Highest Honors and who regularly
handles cases dealing with TEFRA partnership issues. B represents A in an administrative proceeding involving TEFRA
partnership issues and subject to the provisions of this section. Assuming the taxpayer qualifies for an award of
reasonable administrative costs by meeting the requirements of section 7430, the amount of the award attributable
to the fees of B may not exceed the $75 per hour limitation (as adjusted for the cost of living), absent a special factor.
Under these facts alone, B is not a specially qualified representative since even extraordinary knowledge of the
tax laws does not constitute distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill constituting a special factor.

Costs not incurred in an administrative proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs incurred in an administrative proceeding that are incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date,
and that are otherwise described in paragraph (b) of this section, are not recoverable unless they are reasonable
in both nature and amount. For example, costs normally included in the hourly rate of the representative by the custom
and usage of the representative's profession, when billed separately, are not recoverable separate and apart from
the representative's hourly rate. Such costs typically include costs such as secretarial and overhead expenses.
In contrast, costs which are normally billed separately may be reasonable administrative costs that may be recoverable
in addition to the representative's hourly rate. Therefore, necessary costs incurred for travel; expedited mail
delivery; messenger service; expenses while on travel; long distance telephone calls; and necessary copying fees
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, any court, bank or other third party, when normally billed separately from
the representative's hourly rate, may be reasonable administrative costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Rule for Expert Witness' Fees on Issue of Prevailing Market Rates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the taxpayer may initially establish a limited availability of
specially qualified representatives for the proceeding by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by
the taxpayer's representative. The Internal Revenue Service may endeavor to rebut the affidavit submitted on this
issue by demonstrating either that a specially qualified representative was not necessary to represent the taxpayer
in the proceeding, that the taxpayer's representative is not a specially qualified representative or that the prevailing
rate for specially qualified representatives does not exceed $75 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost
of living). Unless the Internal Revenue Service endeavors to demonstrate that the prevailing rate for specially
qualified representatives does not exceed $75 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living), fees for
expert witnesses used to establish prevailing market rates are not included in the term reasonable administrative
costs.

then issues a notice of deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, A discontinues A's administrative efforts
and files a petition with the Tax Court. A's costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of a petition
with the Tax Court are litigation costs and not reasonable administrative costs. Furthermore, A's costs incurred

 except that after A receives the notice of deficiency, A recontacts Appeals. Again, A's costs incurred before the
administrative proceeding date, the date of the notice of deficiency as set forth in &sect;301.7430&hyph;3(c)(3),
are not reasonable administrative costs. A's costs incurred in recontacting and working with Appeals after the issuance
of the notice of deficiency, and up to and including the time of filing of the petition, are reasonable administrative
costs. A's costs incurred in connection with the filing of a petition with the Tax Court are not reasonable administrative
costs because those costs are litigation costs. Similarly, A's costs incurred after the filing of the petition are
not reasonable administrative costs, as those are litigation costs.

(1) Establishes that the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified;

Position of the Internal Revenue Service
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The position of the Internal Revenue Service in an administrative proceeding is the position taken by the Internal
Revenue Service as of the administrative proceeding date (as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;3(c)) or any date thereafter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The position of the Internal Revenue Service is substantially justified if it has a reasonable basis in both fact
and law. A significant factor in determining whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service is substantially
justified as of a given date is whether, on or before that date, the taxpayer has presented all relevant information
under the taxpayer's control and relevant legal arguments supporting the taxpayer's position to the appropriate
Internal Revenue Service personnel. The appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel are personnel responsible
for reviewing the information or arguments, or personnel who would transfer the information or arguments in the normal
course of procedure and administration to the personnel who are responsible.

Exception
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified with respect to some issues in the proceeding
and not substantially justified with respect to the remaining issues, any award of reasonable administrative costs
to the taxpayer may be limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to those issues with respect
to which the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. If the position of the Internal
Revenue Service was substantially justified for only a portion of the period of the proceeding and not substantially
justified for the remaining portion of the proceeding, any award of reasonable administrative costs to the taxpayer
may be limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to that portion during which the position of
the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. Where an award of reasonable administrative costs
is limited to that portion of the administrative proceeding during which the position of the Internal Revenue Service
was not substantially justified, whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified
is determined as of the date any cost is incurred.

Most significant issue or set of issues presented

Only in a multiple issue proceeding can a most significant issue or set of issues presented exist. However, not all
multiple issue proceedings contain a most significant issue or set of issues presented. An issue or set of issues constitutes
the most significant issue or set of issues presented if, despite involving a lesser dollar amount in the proceeding
than the other issue or issues, it objectively represents the most significant issue or set of issues for the taxpayer
or the Internal Revenue Service. This may occur because of the effect of the issue or set of issues on other transactions
or other taxable years of the taxpayer or related parties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Internal Revenue Service, in the conduct of a correspondence examination of taxpayer A's individual income
tax return, requests substantiation from A of claimed medical expenses. A does not respond to the request and the Service
Center issues a notice of deficiency. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A presents sufficient information
and arguments to convince a revenue agent that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. The revenue
agent then closes the case showing no deficiency. Although A incurred costs after the issuance of the notice of deficiency,
A is unable to recover these costs because, as of the date these costs were incurred, A had not presented relevant information
under A's control and relevant legal arguments supporting A's position to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
personnel. Accordingly, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified at the time the
costs were incurred.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the purchase of an ongoing business, taxpayer B obtains from the previous owner of the business a covenant not to
compete for a period of five years. On audit of B's individual income tax return for the year in which the business is
acquired, the Internal Revenue Service challenges the basis assigned to the covenant not to compete and a deduction
taken as a business expense for a seminar attended by B. Both parties agree that the covenant not to compete is amortizable
over a period of five years. However, the Internal Revenue Service asserts that the proper basis of the covenant is
$2X while the taxpayer asserts the basis is $4X. Thus, under the Internal Revenue Service's position, B is entitled
to a deduction of two-fifths $X in the year under audit and for each of the subsequent four years. B's position, however,
would result in a deduction of four-fifths $X for the year under audit and each of the subsequent four years. The deduction
for the seminar attended by B was reported on the return in question in the amount of $X. The Internal Revenue Service's
position is that the deduction for the seminar should be disallowed entirely. In the notice of deficiency, the Internal
Revenue Service determines adjustments of two-fifths $X (the difference between the Internal Revenue Service's
position of two-fifths $X and the reported four-fifths $X) regarding the basis of the covenant not to compete, and
$X resulting from the disallowance of the seminar expense. Thus, of the two adjustments determined for the year under
audit, that attributable to the disallowance of the seminar is larger than that attributable to the covenant not to
compete. However, due to the impact on the next succeeding four years, the covenant not to compete adjustment is objectively
the most significant issue to both B and the Internal Revenue Service.

Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Collection Branch of a Service Center of the Internal Revenue Service determines in the matching process of various
Forms 1099 and W&hyph;2 that taxpayer C has not filed an individual income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service
sends notices to C requesting that C file an income tax return. C does not file a return, so the Service Center's Collection
Branch prepares a substitute for return pursuant to section 6020(b). The calculation is sent to C requesting that
C either sign the return pursuant to section 6020(a) or file a tax return prepared by C. C does not respond to the Internal
Revenue Service's request and the Service Center's Collection Branch issues a notice of deficiency based on information
in its possession. C does not file a petition with the Tax Court and does not pay the asserted deficiency. The Internal
Revenue Service then assesses the tax shown on the notice of deficiency and issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant
to section 6303. After receiving notice and demand, C contacts the Collection Branch and convinces Collection to
stay the collection process because C does not owe any taxes. The Collection Branch recommends that the Examination
Division examine the tax liability and make an adjustment to income. The Examination Division then redetermines
the tax and abates the assessment due to information and arguments presented by C at that time. The costs C incurred
before the Collection Branch are incurred in connection with an action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect
a tax. Therefore, these costs are incurred with respect to a collection action and not an administrative proceeding.
Accordingly, they are not recoverable as reasonable administrative costs. Costs incurred before the Examination
Division are reasonable administrative costs; however, C may not recover any reasonable administrative costs with
respect to the proceeding before the Examination Division because, as of the date the costs were incurred, C had not
previously presented all relevant information under C's control and all relevant legal arguments supporting C's
position to the Collection Branch or Examination Division personnel (the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
personnel under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.7430&hyph;5(c)), and thus, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Treasury decision amends 27 CFR 70.92, in Part 70, Procedure and Administration. The amendments clarify the
period during which interest is allowed on taxpayer overpayments which are credited against other liabilities of
the same taxpayer for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments are necessary as a result of changes
to the law made by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The regulations
affect all taxpayers who have overpayments credited against underpayments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document contains amendments to the regulations on Procedure and Administration (27 CFR part 70) under &sect;6611
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) to clarify the period during which interest is allowed on overpayments that
are credited against a taxpayer's liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments will conform
the regulations to &sect;344 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;248,
96 Stat. 635), and &sect;158 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA) (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 696).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applies &sect;6611 to the taxes it administers and enforces. The IRS published
a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 25, 1992 (57 FR 38457), and Treasury Decision 8524 (59 FR 10075) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on March 3, 1994, adopting final rules implementing the TEFRA and DEFRA amendments. ATF believes these regulations
are equally applicable to its tax collection activities and is adopting such regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Interest on Underpayments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6611(a) of the IRC provides that interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment in respect of any internal
revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under &sect;6621.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;6402(a), the Secretary may credit any overpayment (including any interest allowed thereon) against
any liability imposed on the taxpayer under the IRC. Under &sect;6611(b)(1), interest is allowed on an overpayment
that is so credited from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the taxpayer's liability against which the overpayment
is credited. For purposes of this interest computation, a definition of the term ``due date'' is provided in &sect;70.92(d)
of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, &sect;6601(f) provides that once an overpayment is credited to satisfy a taxpayer's liability, interest
no longer accrues on that liability. Section 344 of TEFRA added &sect;6622 of the IRC, which requires interest imposed
by the IRC to be compounded daily. The effect of &sect;6601(f) on the compounding requirement of &sect;6622 is that
once an overpayment is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest, that credit cuts off any further
compounding of the interest (i.e., interest no longer accrues on the taxpayer's interest liability against which
the credit has been made).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, it is appropriate that no interest liability to the taxpayer accrues on the overpayment once the overpayment
is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest. Thus, the regulations amend &sect;70.92(d)(2)(iii)
to clarify that interest ceases to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against the taxpayer's
liability for interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Certain Additions to the Tax
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to DEFRA, interest only accrued on additions to the tax from the date of notice and demand, and then only if not
paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. In &sect;158 of DEFRA, Congress added &sect;6601(e)(2)(B)
to the IRC, requiring taxpayers to pay interest on certain additions to tax from the due date of the relevant return
(including any extensions) until the addition to the tax is paid. The number of additions to the tax that bear interest
from the due date of the return was increased by Congress in 1988 and again in 1989. This regulation amends &sect;70.92(d)(2)(iv)
to clarify that interest ceases to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against certain additions
to the tax for any period after the due date of the return (including extensions) to which the addition to the tax relates.

Prior Regulations Obsolete
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When ATF assumed responsibility for the collection and enforcement of taxes imposed under Subtitle E of the IRC, it
patterned many of its procedural regulations upon those already promulgated by the IRS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, T.D. ATF&hyph;301, 55 Fed. Reg. 47608 (November 14, 1990); T.D. ATF&hyph;251, 52 Fed. Reg. 19314 (May 22, 1987).
However, since enactment of &sect;6622 of the IRC in TEFRA and &sect;6601(e)(2)(B) in DEFRA, the prior regulations
regarding interest and certain additions to tax have been obsolete. Accordingly, ATF has been computing interest
consistent with the statutory changes and these regulatory amendments acknowledge existing agency practice.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604)
are not applicable to this final rule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking
under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law. A copy of this final rule has been submitted to the Administrator of the Small Business
Administration for comment on the impact of such regulation on small business, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7805(f).

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action because (1) it will not have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the
principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this final rule merely adopts existing IRS procedural regulations regarding overpayment interest, it is
found to be unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision for notice and public procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)
or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 U.S.C. 553(d).

The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing

 In the case of a credit against interest that accrues for any period ending prior to January 1, 1983, the due date is the
earlier of the date of assessment of such interest or December 31, 1982. In the case of a credit against interest that
accrues from any period beginning on or after December 31, 1982, such interest is due as it economically accrues on
a daily basis, rather than when it is assessed.

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in Branford Harbor, around the fireworks barge GT 1000 located approximately
1200 feet southwest of Parker Memorial Park, Branford, CT, on July 1, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the
maritime community from possible navigation hazards associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone is
prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation. The Coast Guard
did not receive from the sponsor the final details concerning the event's exact location, which is essential information
for the purposes of establishing a safety zone in sufficient time to publish a NPRM. If the event, which is centered
around a national holiday and the Town of Branford's 350th birthday, were required to be postponed by publishing a
NPRM, the event would be cancelled. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest
since the fireworks display is for the benefit of the public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sponsor, The Town of Branford and American Legion Post 83, Branford, CT has requested that a 45 minute fireworks
display, launched from a floating platform, be permitted in the port of Branford in the vicinity of Parker Memorial
Park, Branford, CT. This zone is required to protect the maritime community from the dangers associated with this
fireworks display which is occurring over Branford Harbor. The safety zone covers all waters of Branford Harbor within
a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barge GT 1000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The event will last approximately 45 minutes. The area affected by this event receives infrequent commercial traffic.
Because of the short duration of the event and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities will
be able to adjust to any disruptions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons addressed under the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation
to be minimal and certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in Sippican Harbor, Marion, MA, during the Marion Fourth of
July fireworks display. The safety zone will cover the area of Sippican Harbor along the Silver Shell Beach shoreline
out to 400 yards east of the shoreline. The safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard
these vessels from injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks.

 publication. Due to the date when this office received the application, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed
rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to public interest since the
fireworks display is for public viewing and is intended to celebrate the 4th of July holiday weekend.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 4, 1994, the town of Marion, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Fourth of July Fireworks display between the
hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. The fireworks will be launched from a site on Silver Shell Beach and will project onto the waters
of Sippican Harbor. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area of Sippican Harbor over
which the fireworks will be launched. The Coast Guard will establish this safety zone from the shoreline of Silver
Shell Beach (north end of safety zone is buoy C ``7'' and runs south to Spragues Cove), extending eastward 400 yards
into Sippican Harbor, between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 4, 1994. In the event of inclement weather, the rain
date will be July 5, 1994 at the same times.

Regulatory Evaluation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for two hours on one
day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These
vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 400
yards from the shoreline, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible
due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation,
the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C.
605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in Onset Harbor, Onset, MA, on July 9, 1994 during the Onset
Fire Department Centennial Celebration. While this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into
or out of Sunset Cove. This safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard these vessels from
injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 9, 1994, the town of Onset, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Onset Fire Works Centennial Celebration between
the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area over which the fireworks
will be launched. The safety zone will include all waters from the Shell Point Beach south to buoy C ``1'' then southwest
to a danger buoy at position 41 degrees 44.13
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; North and 70 degrees 39.83
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; West then northwest to the mouth of Sunset Cove, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 9, 1994. While
this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into or out of Sunset Cove.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for one hour on one
day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These
vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 300
yards from the staging area, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible
due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation,
the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C.
605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Postal Service regulations concerning the disposition of stolen mail matter and property acquired by the Postal
Inspection Service for use as evidence are published in title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as part 946.
Section 946.11, disposition of property declared abandoned, is amended to authorize the Chief Postal Inspector
to delegate authority to approve the sharing of property declared abandoned with federal, state, or local law enforcement
agencies. This will make section 946.11 consistent with the other sections of part 946.

, decided May 2, 1994), the Supreme Court held that ash generated by certain municipal waste-to-energy facilities
that burn household wastes alone or in combination with nonhazardous wastes from industrial and commercial sources
is not exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). When the
decision takes effect, persons who generate such ash will need to determine whether it is a hazardous waste under Subtitle
C of RCRA. Ash that is hazardous will need to be managed in compliance with all applicable hazardous waste regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Court's decision, EPA is today announcing that there has been substantial confusion as to when the
owners and operators of facilities managing such ash were required to file applications for RCRA hazardous waste
permits. EPA is exercising its authority under 40 CFR 270.10(e)(2) to extend the deadline for filing permit applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also is announcing today that it considers ash from these combustion facilities to be a newly identified waste
for purposes of the land disposal restrictions under sections 3004(d)-(m) of RCRA. Current land disposal restrictions
do not apply. Rather, the Agency has a duty to promulgate ash-specific restrictions 6 months from the date of today's
document. All other hazardous waste regulations will apply to hazardous ash when the decision takes effect.

, decided May 2, 1994). The Court held that this provision does not exempt ash generated at resource recovery facilities
burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial wastes (hereafter ``waste-to-energy facilities'') from
the hazardous waste requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA. The Court also held that Section 3001(i) terminated a 1980
regulatory exemption for ash generated at waste-to-energy facilities that burn only household wastes. The opinion
requires EPA to revise its prior position that both types of ash were exempt from hazardous waste regulation. It abruptly
ends nearly a decade of controversy over the regulatory status of ash from these facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this decision, ash from waste-to-energy facilities has the same status as other solid wastes. Persons
who generate such wastes must determine whether that waste is a hazardous waste under EPA's hazardous waste identification
rules at 40 CFR part 261. Since EPA has not listed ash as a hazardous waste, generators must determine whether ash exhibits
any of the characteristics of hazardous waste at 40 CFR 261.21&hyph;.24. Ash that exhibits a characteristic must
be managed in compliance with Subtitle C requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained below, the regulatory status of ash has been the subject of confusion for several years. EPA's action
today responds by giving owners and operators of facilities that manage ash that is determined to be characteristically
hazardous a reasonable opportunity to obtain interim status by applying for a RCRA hazardous waste permit. Without
this opportunity, persons managing hazardous ash would be out of compliance with RCRA's permit requirements and
face potentially significant civil and criminal penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice EPA is also announcing that it will consider ash that is characteristically hazardous to be a ``newly
identified'' waste under the land disposal restrictions. EPA needs time to determine what treatment standards would
be appropriate. By considering such ash to be a newly identified waste under the land disposal restrictions, EPA will
have an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of the existing standards and, if necessary, develop new ash-specific
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that all other applicable Subtitle C regulations will apply to ash on the date that the Court's decision takes
effect. See the discussion of state authorization below for assistance in determining when the Court's decision
will affect particular facilities. The Agency interprets the Court's decision to cut-off the exemption for waste
management at waste-to-energy facilities at the point that ash is generated. Subsequent management of hazardous
ash on-site is subject to regulation under Subtitle C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Combustion of municipal solid waste, particularly through waste-to-energy facilities, can be an important component
of a local government's waste management practices. As of 1990, approximately 196 million tons of municipal solid
waste were generated annually in the U.S., 16 percent of which (32 million tons) was combusted. The states with the
greatest municipal waste combustion capacity are Florida, New York and Massachusetts. There are approximately
150 municipal waste combustors in the U.S., 80 percent of which are waste-to-energy facilities. The remaining 20
percent incinerate waste without recovering energy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 25 percent (by weight) of the waste that is combusted remains as ash, amounting to around eight million
tons of municipal waste combustor ash generated annually. Generally, these combustion facilities generate two
basic types of ash_bottom ash and air pollution control residuals, commonly referred to as ``fly ash.'' Bottom ash
collects at the bottom of the combustion unit and comprises approximately 75&hyph;80% of the total ash. Fly ash collects
in the air pollution control devices that ``clean'' the gases produced during the combustion of the waste and comprises
around 20&hyph;25% of the total. Based on several analytical studies, fly ash generally contains the highest concentrations
of inorganic chemical constituents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies also show that ash (usually fly ash) has sometimes exhibited EPA's Toxicity Characteristic (``TC''). Typically,
ash that ``fails'' the TC leaches lead or cadmium above levels of concern. Because a number of factors can influence
whether ash passes or fails the TC (e.g., the nature of the incoming waste stream, the type of combustion unit, the nature
of the air pollution control device and the ash sampling location), EPA cannot predict an overall failure rate for
ash from municipal waste combustors.

RCRA requires any person treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste to obtain a permit or a pre-permit authorization
called ``interim status.'' Section 3005; 40 CFR 270.1(b). To qualify for interim status a facility must meet criteria
set out in RCRA section 3005(e), which include filing a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When EPA promulgates RCRA rules subjecting a new group of facilities to hazardous waste permitting requirements,
the permit regulations provide 6 months for the filing of part A of the permit application. 40 CFR 270.10 (e). EPA routinely
publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the specific permit deadline for persons regulated by the new rules. See 270.10 (e), note. Section 270.10(e)(2) provides
that EPA can extend the date for permit applications by

 notice if it finds that there has been ``substantial confusion'' as to whether the owner or operator was required to
file a permit application and the confusion was due to ambiguities in EPA's regulations. For the reasons explained
below, EPA today is exercising its discretion to extend the submission dates for part A permit applications for facilities
treating, storing and disposing of ash from waste-to-energy facilities that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous
waste.

B. Regulatory History of Waste-to-Energy Ash
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1980, EPA promulgated a rule exempting household wastes from all RCRA requirements for hazardous wastes. 40 CFR
261.4(b)(1). EPA interpreted this exemption to extend to residuals from the treatment of household wastes, including
ash from the combustion of household wastes. The exemption, however, did not address ash from the combustion of household
wastes combined with nonhazardous commercial and industrial wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984 Congress added to RCRA a new Section 3001(i), entitled ``Clarification of Household Waste Exemption.'' This
provision addressed waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial and industrial
wastes to produce energy. In July 1985, EPA promulgated a rule that codified this provision. In the preamble accompanying
this rule, EPA announced that it interpreted the statute and the rule to exempt the facilities_but not their ash_from
Subtitle C, 50 FR 28702, 28725&hyph;26 (July 15, 1985). EPA did not publish any statement informing owners of facilities
managing ash of any deadline for obtaining RCRA permits.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the late 1980's, various EPA officials began taking the position that Section 3001(i) could be interpreted to exempt
ash from Subtitle C. They also expressed the opinion that ash could be managed safely in nonhazardous waste disposal
facilities. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed citizen suits in two separate U.S. District Courts to enforce
the 1985 interpretation of the statute against two specific waste-to-energy facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the late 1980's, Congress considered a number of bills that would have explicitly exempted ash from Subtitle
C requirements. In November 1990, Congress enacted an uncodified amendment to the Clean Air Act prohibiting EPA from
regulating ash as a hazardous waste under Section 3001 of RCRA for a period of two years. Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub.L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these events, a number of states authorized to implement Subtitle C programs in lieu of EPA began treating
ash from waste-to-energy facilities as exempt. Some interpreted their own regulations virtually identical to Section
3001(i). Others promulgated specific ash exemptions. Many of these specific exemptions were accompanied by detailed
regulations for the management of ash as a nonhazardous waste. Consistent with the evolving federal position on the
regulation of ash, EPA took no action affecting these state programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in September 1992, just before the expiration of the Clean Air Act ash ``moratorium,'' EPA Administrator
William Reilly signed a memorandum announcing that the Agency now interpreted Section 3001(i) to exempt ash from
waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous wastes from Subtitle C requirements. This
memorandum also announced that EPA believed that ash could be disposed of safely in landfills meeting new standards
for municipal solid waste facilities promulgated in 1991 and codified at 40 CFR part 258.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA finds that the events above have created substantial confusion about the status of ash under the rule EPA wrote
to codify the exemption in Section 3001(i). Although EPA's 1980 and 1985 preambles indicated that there was no exemption
for ash from combined sources, later events suggested that ash was not regulated. Persons may have relied on the two
District Court decisions, the 1990 ash moratorium, or the 1992 Reilly memorandum to conclude that Section 3001(i)
and 40 CFR 261.4(b)(2) were ambiguous about the status of ash from combined sources. They could quite reasonably have
concluded that they could manage ash from combined sources without obtaining hazardous waste permits. If EPA did
not act to extend the Part A deadline, however, these facilities would be unable to obtain interim status because the
Court's action is not a statutory or regulatory change establishing a new period for obtaining interim status under
RCRA section 3005(e). Such facilities would have to cease handling hazardous ash until EPA took final action on their
completed permit applications_a process that typically takes several years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 270.10(e)(2) was written to prevent such harsh results. EPA is today invoking its authority to provide a reasonable
opportunity for persons managing combined ash to satisfy RCRA's permitting requirements. Applying the substantial
confusion approach to facilities managing this ash is consistent with previous precedents. See, e.g., 52 FR 34779&hyph;81
(Sept. 15, 1987) (notice of substantial confusion for big city cement kilns).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons handling ash from the combustion of 100% household waste could have relied with even greater justification
on the Agency's 1980 interpretation of the household waste exemption to handle such waste without a hazardous waste
permit. They are also entitled to an opportunity to satisfy the permit requirement. Since they are becoming subject
to Subtitle C without the enactment of a statute or the promulgation of a rule, they do not technically qualify for the
normal 6 months provided for persons newly subject to Subtitle C regulation. See section 40 CFR 270.10(e)(1). Section
270.10(e)(1)(ii), which provides 30 days for filing a Part A after a facility ``first becomes subject to the [Subtitle
C] standards'' could apply to these facilities. EPA, however, interprets this provision to apply to facilities whose
own actions subject them to Subtitle C rather than to facilities affected by regulatory events. (An example would
be a generator that exceeded the small quantity generator monthly waste generation limit.) See generally 45 FR 76630,
76633 (November 19, 1980). Consequently, EPA believes the ``substantial confusion'' approach is also appropriate
for persons who manage 100% household waste. Moreover, it reduces confusion by establishing a single deadline for
both types of ash from waste-to-energy facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA today establishes that facilities that are handling hazardous ash from waste-to-energy facilities
that wish to continue to do so may file Part A applications anytime before December 7, 1994. See the discussion of state
authorization below for guidance on where to request and submit an application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another statutory requirement for obtaining interim status is the filing of any notification required under section
3010(a) of RCRA. Under section 3010, EPA may require all persons that handle hazardous wastes_including generators
and transporters_to notify EPA of the location of their activities within 90 days of the promulgation of a new rule
identifying additional characteristics or listing a waste. This provision does not literally apply because EPA
is not promulgating or revising a rule. However, failure to satisfy it could cloud a facility's claim that it obtained
interim status. In order to prevent this result, EPA is exercising its discretion to waive filing of section 3010 notifications
by facilities managing ash from resource recovery facilities. EPA notes that persons who manage ash will be required
to obtain EPA identification numbers in the near future. This process will furnish the information that the notifications
would have provided.

IV. Land Disposal Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RCRA land disposal restrictions (LDRs) prohibit land disposal of hazardous wastes unless those wastes are first
treated to substantially reduce toxicity or mobility of the hazardous constituents in the wastes so as to minimize
threats to human health and the environment. RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (g), (m). The restrictions specify dates
on which particular groups of wastes are prohibited from land disposal unless they are treated. RCRA sections 3004
(d), (e), (g). For wastes which are ``newly identified or listed'' after November 8, 1984, EPA must promulgate treatment
standards within 6 months of the date of identification or listing. RCRA section 3004(g)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 1, 1990, EPA promulgated treatment standards for constituents in wastes identified as hazardous under the
``EP toxicity'' characteristic, the predecessor to the current TC. 55 FR 22520. The treatment standards for metal
constituents are levels identical to the EP toxicity standards themselves. 40 CFR 268.41. (EPA notes that it must
revise these standards under

EPA,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 976 F.2d 2 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (the ``Third Third'' decision).) Persons generating wastes that fail the current TC test
must determine whether their TC wastes exceed these EP levels, and, if they do, comply with the treatment standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, believes that ash from waste-to-energy facilities is ``newly identified'' for purposes of the land
disposal restrictions. Although technically ash would be identified as hazardous under the existing TC rather than
a new characteristic rule, the Supreme Court's decision is bringing ash into the Subtitle C system for the first time
(for ash from 100% household waste) or returning it to the system after a period of uncertainty and actual legislative
exemption (for ash from combined sources). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA dealt with a similar situation in a 1990 LDR rule. In that notice, EPA interpreted section 3004(g)(4) for mineral
processing wastes brought into RCRA by a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
holding that EPA had improperly considered them to be exempt from Subtitle C under the statute's ``Bevill amendment''.
(The mineral processing wastes also sometimes exceed the TC and EP toxicity levels for metals.) In that notice, EPA
explained that section 3004(g)(4) is ambiguous as to whether it applies to wastes brought into the system after 1984
due to regulatory reinterpretation. See 55 FR 22667 (June 1, 1990). EPA determined that it was preferable to read section
3004(g)(4) to include such wastes because that reading was more consistent with the policy goals that prompted Congress
to establish a separate schedule for new wastes in the first place: the need to study such wastes separately to set appropriate
treatment standards, and the established priority of subjecting older wastes to the land ban first. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also noted that, before it developed specific treatment standards for the newly-identified mineral processing
wastes, the wastes could be regulated under existing treatment standards for EP toxicity metals. EPA determined
that it would not be appropriate to apply those treatment standards, however, because it had not analyzed and tested
the wastes to determine whether those standards would meet the statuary requirements of reduced toxicity and mobility.
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ash from 100% household waste clearly fits this precedent. It, too, is being regulated under Subtitle C for the first
time as the result of a court decision narrowing an Agency interpretation of an existing Subtitle C exemption. Further,
as explained in more detail below, EPA needs to determine whether exiting EP toxicity treatment standards will meet
land treatment standard requirements for this ash. Accordingly, EPA interprets section 3004(g)(4) to apply to this
ash. EPA will not apply the current treatment standards for the EP toxicity characteristic to ash which is identified
as hazardous under the TC. Section 3004(g)(4) will require EPA to promulgate treatment standards for this ash within
6 months of the date of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ash from combined sources is not entering Subtitle C jurisdiction for the first time_it was not exempt under EPA's
original household waste exemption, and was not originally viewed as exempt under section 3001(i). Nevertheless,
EPA believes that it would be appropriate and consistent with the goals of the LDRs to view it as a newly identified waste
under section 3004(g)(4). Section 3004(g)(4) is ambiguous as to wastes reentering Subtitle C after several years
of confusion and two years of clear statutory exemption. Moreover, EPA has not studied ash to determine what treatment
standards would meet the requirements of Section 3004(m) of RCRA, and in fact is reviewing what the appropriate treatment
standards are for all of the wastes with metal constituents exhibiting the Toxicity Characteristic. 58 FR 48116 (Sept.
14, 1993). Congress' priority scheme for land disposal restrictions directs EPA to promulgate standards for post-1984
wastes in chronological order. If EPA were required to immediately determine whether the current EP toxicity standards
for ash were appropriate, it would have to postpone work on treatment standards for new listings and a new characteristic
promulgated several years prior to the City of Chicago

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For these reasons, EPA will also consider ash from combined sources to be newly identified for purposes of the land
disposal restrictions. Furthermore, it will not apply the existing treatment standards for EP toxicity. As a result
of this decision, Section 3004(g)(4) requires EPA to promulgate treatment standards for combined ash within 6 months
of the date of this notice.

V. Other Subtitle C Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is not extending compliance dates for any other aspect of the hazardous waste regulations. Facilities generating,
transporting, or treating, storing or disposing of hazardous ash must, as a matter of federal law, comply with the
substantive requirements of 40 CFR parts 260&hyph;270 on the effective date of the Court's decision. (See the discussion
of state authorization below to determine when the decision takes effect under authorized state RCRA programs.)
EPA reminds generators, transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities that they must promptly obtain
EPA identification numbers. See, e.g., 40 CFR 262.12. EPA intends to issue an implementation strategy in the near
future that will provide additional information on complying with other RCRA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate compliance with Subtitle C, EPA has developed draft guidance for the sampling of ash from waste-to-energy
facilities. EPA has already released this draft. Interested parties may obtain a copy by calling the RCRA/Superfund
Hotline, Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (800)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that by following certain waste management practices, some facilities may not need interim status or a RCRA
permit. For example, under federal regulations, generators of hazardous ash may accumulate and treat ash onsite
in tanks or containers for up to 90 days without obtaining hazardous waste permits under 40 CFR 262.34. See also 51 FR

1. General Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3006(b) of RCRA allows states to obtain authorization to implement state hazardous waste programs in lieu
of federal law. To obtain authorization, a state must show that its program is equivalent to the Federal program. EPA
interprets this requirement to mean that state laws and rules must be no less stringent than federal requirements.
Section 3009, however, expressly allows states the option of establishing more stringent requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forty-eight states and territories are now authorized for all of the RCRA requirements established prior to November
1984 (the RCRA ``base program''). In these states, the state's definition of hazardous waste_including any exemptions_operates
in lieu of the federal definition. Changes to the federal definition do not automatically revise independently promulgated
state regulations. Rather, the states are required to revise their programs and submit the revisions to EPA for approval.
The revision does not take effect under federal law until EPA approves the revision. As explained below, in a few of
these states, the Court's decision may not take effect on its federal law effective date. EPA believes that there are
very few states in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the Court's decision does eliminate an exemption for ash, the hazardous waste characteristic most likely to
apply to ash is the TC as determined by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (``TCLP'') promulgated by
EPA in 1990. This rule was promulgated under one of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (``HSWA''). Section
3006(g) provides that rules promulgated under HSWA take effect in all states at the same time, displacing state rules
unless the state rules are more stringent. EPA implements the new HSWA rule until the state adopts an equivalent provision,
submits it to EPA, and obtains EPA approval. 50 FR 28728&hyph;30. (July 15, 1985). The TC and TCLP displaced the 1980
EP toxicity characteristic and leaching procedure. The EP, however, also remains in effect as a matter of state law
in many states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixteen states are now authorized for the TC and TCLP (see list in Table 1). EPA continues to implement the TC and the
TCLP in the remaining states. EPA takes the position that, where it implements the TC, it uses federal permitting procedures.
Consequently, EPA will implement the permit deadline extension announced today in all states where it implements
the TC. Owners and operators in those states would file Part A applications with EPA Regional Offices. (See list in
Table 2.) Where a state has been authorized to implement the TC, however, state permit procedures are in effect. Today's
deadline extension is not in effect in those states. Moreover, since the extension makes permit requirements less
stringent, states are not required to adopt equivalent extensions. If any of these states chooses to provide equivalent
relief, owners and operators would file permit applications with the state agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To summarize, in order to determine the impact of today's action, persons handling ash must determine (1) the impact
of the Court's decision on the RCRA program in each state (primarily an issue of whether a state's base program contains
an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
authorized 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
exemption for ash) and (2) whether the entity authorized to implement the TC and TCLP has extended its permit deadline.

a. Unauthorized states.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the eight states and territories where EPA implements all portions of the RCRA program (see Table 1 for a list of these
states and territories), including the base program, the Court's decision will eliminate EPA's interpretative
ash exemption on the opinion's effective date. Since EPA implements the TC, the permit deadline extension will take
effect today. Owners and operators of facilities who wish to obtain interim status to manage hazardous ash may file
Part A applications with EPA Regional Offices. (See list in Table 2.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(i) States with no ash exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since states may maintain more stringent RCRA programs, some states may never have exempted ash from hazardous waste
requirements. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
City of Chicago
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision has no impact in these states. No permit deadline extensions are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) States with unauthorized ash exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA knows that, during the years of confusion over the status of ash, some states exempted ash from their Subtitle C
programs. Most of these states, however, did not submit these provisions to EPA for authorization reviews. Although
they arguably may have made the state programs less stringent than the federal program, EPA would have taken no action
to force the states to eliminate them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Effect of court's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of these states adopted provisions resembling 3001(i) and interpreted them to exempt ash. Whether the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
City of Chicago 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision requires these states to abandon these interpretations is an issue of state law that can be answered authoritatively
only by state officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other states promulgated rules under their solid waste authorities that established ash-specific management standards
that implicitly_or explicitly_transferred ash management from their hazardous waste programs to their solid waste
programs. The status of these provisions is again an issue of state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Effect of today's deadline extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the state never obtained authorization for its exemption for ash, its authorized program still regulates ash
as a hazardous waste. The regulated community, however, could have been confused about the status of ash, so the relief
provided by the deadline extension would be appropriate. Whether or not the extension is in effect, however, depends
on which entity is authorized to implement the TC. As explained above, where EPA implements the TC, it will apply today's
notice. Where states implement the TC, today's notice cannot operate to revise state permit rules. The state would
need to determine whether it wanted to provide equivalent relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Requirements for program revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the court's decision, states with unauthorized ash exemptions now have state law requirements that
are less stringent than the federal Subtitle C program. EPA is today notifying those states that they must revise their
laws and regulations to eliminate the less stringent provisions. Although EPA is not today initiating any withdrawals
of state programs, it advises states to take timely action to eliminate their ash exemptions. Since these provisions
are not part of states' authorized RCRA programs, no Subtitle C program revisions will be necessary. Rather, EPA advises
states to notify Regional Offices informally by letter when they have eliminated their exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Where to file Part A applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where EPA implements the TC, owners and operators must file Part A applications with the appropriate EPA Regional
Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a state that is authorized to implement the TC decides to extend the filing deadline, owners and operators must
file with the state hazardous waste agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) States with authorized ash exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may have authorized a few ash exemptions during the late 1980's and early 1990's. EPA has not found any such authorization
during a limited review prior to the publication of this emergency notice. Consequently, EPA believes that there
are very few states in this category. Nevertheless, in case such states exist, EPA is explaining their obligations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Effect of court decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether or not the decision affected the state law or rule that EPA authorized is a state law issue. State officials
will need to make that determination. If a state determines that its state provision is still in effect, both the state
law and the authorized RCRA program will continue to exempt ash until such time as the state revises its program and
obtains EPA approval for its revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Effect of today's permit deadline extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If ash is still exempt under both state law and the authorized program, no permits are currently required. Today's
filing date extension would not take effect. As explained in (D.) below, in some cases EPA will announce an extension
when it approves a revision eliminating an ash exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) State program revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where ash exemptions remain in effect, state programs will be less stringent than the federal program. Formal state
program revisions, including notice and comment rulemaking, will be required under 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(ii). The
deadline for these revisions will be July 1, 1995 under 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(ii). An additional year is available where
states must make statutory changes. 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Where to file Part A applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time that the state receives EPA authorization for the revision that eliminates its ash exemption, if EPA is
still implementing the TC, it will make a finding of substantial confusion and extend the Part A deadline for that state.
Owners and operators desiring interim status will need to file applications with the appropriate EPA Regional Office.
EPA will not be able to provide this relief where a state is authorized to implement the TC. Those states must determine
whether they want to extend permit deadlines. If they do, owners and operators wishing to obtain interim status will
need to file applications with the appropriate state agency.

B. Land Disposal Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The LDRs are HSWA rules initially implemented by EPA. Moreover, EPA has established that it will not delegate its authority
to set treatment standards to states. EPA views determinations linked to the need for and scope of treatment standards
as similarly nondelegable. This includes today's interpretation that ash from waste-to-energy facilities is a
newly identified waste under section 3004(g)(4). This interpretation is effective in all states, including those
authorized to implement the delegable portions of the land disposal restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Good Cause Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 270.10(e)(2) does not require notice and comment rulemaking for substantial confusion notices. Rather,
it simply requires EPA to publish a ``notice'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To the extent that this notice is a rulemaking for the purposes of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA), EPA believes that it has ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA to extend the permit application
deadline without prior notice and opportunity for comment. First, EPA believes that its determination regarding
the existence of regulatory confusion is an ``interpretative rule'' for which notice and comment is not required
under section 553(b)(3)(A) of the APA. It clarifies and explains existing law rather than creating new duties. Moreover,
the establishment of a due date for Part A permit applications is a procedural rule also exempt from notice and comment
under section 553(b)(3)(A) of the APA. The effect of establishing this new date is that EPA will not take enforcement
action for operation without a RCRA permit against a facility that submits its application in compliance with this
notice and that meets the other conditions of RCRA section 3005(e). Finally, EPA views the issues of whether confusion
existed and whether it was ``substantial'' as subjects on which comment would not be useful and would not serve the
public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's findings concerning the land disposal restrictions are also ``interpretative rules'' exempt from notice
and comment requirements. They provide EPA's views on the scope of section 3004(g)(4) of RCRA. Moreover, EPA would
have good cause to eliminate notice and comment even if these determinations are regarded as legislative rules. The
land disposal restrictions would take effect for ash approximately 25 days after the Court issued its opinion. It
would be impossible for facilities managing ash to come into compliance with the restrictions in that short time.
See 55 FR 22521 (June 1, 1990) (Third Third LDR rule_EPA provides 90 days for persons managing wastes subject to new
treatment standards to come into compliance.) The Court's decision thus creates an emergency justifying use of the
``good cause'' exemption under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it involves novel policy issues arising out of legal mandates. However, OMB waived review of this
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the Agency to prepare and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes
the impact of a proposed or final rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the Administrator certifies that the rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ruling of the Supreme Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
City of Chicago 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will result in additional costs for waste management facilities and some of those costs will be borne by small entities.
The Agency does not have estimates of those costs. Today's rule extends the date by which affected facilities must
submit a Part A permit application. This action will lower the costs to small entities that will have to comply with
the Court's ruling. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605b, I certify that this regulation will not have a substantial
impact on small entities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule provides that operators may not transport a hazardous liquid in a steel interstate pipeline constructed
before January 8, 1971, a steel interstate offshore gathering line constructed before August 1, 1977, or a steel intrastate
pipeline constructed before October 21, 1985, unless the pipeline has been pressure tested hydrostatically according
to current standards or operates at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. In addition,
this final rule creates a comparable requirement for carbon dioxide pipelines constructed before July 12, 1991,
except for production field distribution lines in rural areas. The purpose of this final rule is to ensure that the
affected pipelines have an adequate safety margin between their maximum operating pressure and test pressure. This
safety margin is essential to prevention of particular kinds of pipeline accidents.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any steel pipeline may contain hidden physical defects that result from the manufacture or transportation of pipe
and from pipeline construction. Over the operational life of the pipeline, new physical defects can be created by
external forces acting on the pipeline. When a physical defect is large enough, it can cause the pipeline to fail during
operation. Also, during pipeline operation, internal or environmental stresses can cause smaller defects to grow
and become large enough to cause the pipeline to fail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate pressure testing can disclose hidden physical defects in a pipeline. Pressure testing involves raising
a pipeline's internal pressure above its maximum operating pressure (MOP) for a time sufficient for leaks to develop
from defects. A test that is adequate in pressure level and duration will disclose physical defects that are large
enough to cause pipeline failure during operation. In addition, an adequate pressure test will provide a proven margin
of safety against failure during operation from the growth of defects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Line pipe research has demonstrated that 125 percent of MOP is the minimum test level adequate to protect hazardous
liquid pipelines against failure in operation from physical defects. A pressure test at this level for a sufficient
duration provides a 25 percent proven margin of safety against failures caused by the growth of physical defects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;195.302, new steel pipelines must be pressure tested to provide at least a 25 percent proven margin of
safety. Hazardous liquid pipelines must be pressure tested hydrostatically, but carbon dioxide pipelines may be
tested pneumatically, using inert gas or carbon dioxide as the test medium (see &sect;195.306). Portions of existing
steel pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed are also subject to this pressure testing requirement.
The requirement became effective as follows for pipelines subject to part 195: January 8, 1971, for interstate pipelines
transporting hazardous liquid (35 FR 17183); August 1, 1977, for interstate offshore gathering lines transporting
hazardous liquid (41 FR 34039); October 21, 1985, for intrastate pipelines transporting hazardous liquid (50 FR
15895); and July 12, 1991, for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide in a supercritical state (56 FR 26922). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 195.302 also requires that certain older pipelines transporting highly volatile liquids (HVL) must have
at least a 25 percent proven margin of safety. These pipelines are onshore steel interstate pipelines constructed
before January 8, 1971, and onshore steel intrastate pipelines constructed before October 21, 1985. If an older HVL
pipeline has not been hydrostatically tested to part 195 standards, &sect;195.302(b) permits operators to provide
the proven margin of safety either by hydrostatic testing or by establishing the pipeline's MOP under &sect;195.406(a)(5)
at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. Establishing MOP under &sect;195.406(a)(5)
and hydrostatic testing to part 195 standards provide equivalent proven margins of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from these older HVL pipelines, the 25 percent proven margin-of-safety requirement does not apply to older
pipelines constructed before the dates (stated above) the pressure testing requirement went into effect for new
pipelines. Consequently, many older pipelines subject to part 195 are not operated with a minimum 25 percent proven
margin of safety. It was not common industry practice to test to at least 125 percent of MOP or to test to that pressure
level for a sufficient duration.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Older pipelines that do not have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety are more susceptible to failures from
defect growth in service than pipelines that meet the part 195 pressure testing requirements. They are also more susceptible
to failure from defect growth during instances of overpressure permitted by &sect;195.406(b). This increased potential
for failure is prevalent in pipelines made of pre-1970 electric resistance welded (ERW) pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA's pipeline accident statistics show the benefits of requiring older pipelines to have a minimum 25 percent proven
margin of safety. September 15, 1985, was the date by which onshore interstate pipelines constructed before January
8, 1971, that transport HVL had to have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety. By that date these pipelines had
to have been pressure tested hydrostatically to part 195 requirements or operated at 80 percent or less of a qualified
prior test or operating pressure. To learn the effect of the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement, RSPA compared
the period for which accident data were available before the requirement was adopted with the period from September
15, 1985, through December 31, 1989. Onshore HVL interstate pipelines had a 68 percent lower rate of failure from material
defects and corrosion during the latter period. RSPA attributed this dramatic drop in failure rate to the 25-percent-safety-margin
requirement imposed on the older onshore HVL interstate pipelines. In addition, RSPA concluded that operators could
achieve a comparable reduction in failure rate on all other older pipelines subject to part 195 that lack an adequate
proven margin of safety.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To bring about this reduction in failure rate, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (Docket PS&hyph;121;
56 FR 23538, May 22, 1991) on testing older pipelines. The notice proposed to extend the part 195 requirement for a proven
margin of safety to all pipelines that are covered by part 195 but excepted from the testing standards in subpart E of
part 195. These pipelines are (1) hazardous liquid steel interstate pipelines constructed before January 8, 1971,
other than onshore HVL pipelines; (2) hazardous liquid steel interstate offshore gathering lines constructed before
August 1, 1977; (3) hazardous liquid steel intrastate pipelines constructed before October 21, 1985, other than
onshore HVL pipelines; and (4) carbon dioxide steel pipelines constructed before July 12, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, RSPA also discussed the unique safety problems with longitudinal seams on ERW pipe manufactured before
1970. RSPA proposed that operators give pipelines with a predominance of pre-1970 ERW pipe priority in scheduling
tests. Under this proposal, testing of pipelines known to have more than 50 percent (by mileage) of pre-1970 ERW pipe
would have to be completed within 4.5 years after a final rule is published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirteen persons submitted written comments on the NPRM: 11 pipeline operators, the American Petroleum Institute
(API), and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). A discussion of the significant comments and their disposition
in development of the final rules follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters discussed specific problems they anticipated in carrying out the rulemaking proposals, without
objecting to them outright. DOI favored adoption of the proposals, especially for offshore pipelines. One commenter,
a major operator of hazardous liquid pipelines, clearly supported the proposed rules. A few other operators hedged
their apparent agreement with the proposals by suggesting RSPA allow smart pigs as a substitute for pressure testing
or MOP reduction, an issue discussed separately below. Another operator asserted that RSPA should require pressure
testing or MOP reduction only where risk is heightened by factors such as adverse leak or corrosion history, environmental
sensitivity, or high population. Only two operators strongly objected to the proposals. But, they aimed their remarks
at carbon dioxide pipelines, and as discussed below, the final rule addresses their concerns. By and large, RSPA believes
the commenters supported the objective of the notice concerning older untested or inadequately tested hazardous
liquid pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting the application of the proposed rules to older pipelines that have an increased risk of failure or that are
near environmentally sensitive areas or a large number of people does not sufficiently address safety concerns.
The problem of the growth of defects is common among all pipelines regulated by part 195. It is not limited to pipelines
that are in a worrisome condition or a high risk location. For such problems, RSPA believes that all pipelines should
provide a basic level of protection. The proposals in the NPRM were consistent with this view. They would assure that
older pipelines provide at least the same basic level of protection against the growth of defects as newer pipelines
must provide. Also, limiting the proposed rules to pipelines that involve some added element of risk would leave many
miles of older pipelines without adequate protection against failures caused by the growth of defects. RSPA strongly
believes these potential failures and preventable damages should not go unchecked.

Pump Stations and Tank Farms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
API and two operators argued that the proposed rules should not apply to pump stations, tank farms, or tank farm delivery
facilities. They said compliance would be an extremely time-consuming task because of the many fittings, valves,
tanks, and instrumentation. API also suggested the benefits would be questionable since most accidents, as described
in the NPRM, occur on pipeline rights-of-way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 195 has limited application at tank farms. In general, it applies to only receiving and reinjection lines, to
tanks used as breakout tanks, and to facilities associated with breakout tanks.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the job of testing pump station and breakout tank facilities may be time-consuming, it is crucial to ensure
public safety and protect the environment. Population has encroached on the older pump stations and tank farms since
their construction, increasing their threat to public safety. Also, slow leaks at tank farms have polluted ground
water and endangered neighborhoods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering the issue of pump stations and tank farms, RSPA examined the existing rule in &sect;195.302 regarding
the testing of older onshore HVL pipelines. Except for tank farm facilities to which the rule does not apply, &sect;195.302
does not exclude any of the facilities the commenters suggested RSPA exclude from the present rulemaking. RSPA believes
non-HVL facilities should not be treated differently. Leaks at non-HVL hazardous liquid facilities can have fire
and pollution consequences. Also, even minor accidents at breakout tanks in tank farms have the potential to become
uncontrollable emergencies because of proximity to other large volume hazardous liquid storage tanks. Therefore,
RSPA has adopted the final rule as proposed concerning pump stations and breakout tanks. The demands of testing these
facilities should be mitigated, however, by the compliance deadlines, which are discussed next. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance Deadlines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA proposed a deadline of 1 year after publication of the final rule for operators to plan and schedule testing or
to reduce MOPs. RSPA also proposed a deadline of 4.5 years after publication of the final rule for testing all pipelines
with more than 50 percent pre-1970 ERW pipe, and for testing at least 50 percent of all other pipelines. Finally, RSPA
proposed that operators complete all testing within 7.5 years after publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator argued that RSPA should allow operators to use the entire test period to plan testing or to reduce MOPs.
This commenter said that planning for testing or reduction in MOP would involve complicated analyses that would take
longer than 1 year. The commenter also said any plan may need to be changed because of unforeseen operational problems
that may arise during the test period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA proposed a 1-year deadline to assure that operators start their testing program early in the test period. Early
planning is necessary to minimize unexpected delays and assure that operators complete testing within the time allowed.
Also, RSPA assumed that when operators plan to reduce MOP, the reduction could be done without lengthy preparations.
Further, RSPA strongly believes any MOP reduction should be done early in the program to lessen the continuing risk
to the public. If unforeseen testing or operational problems arise during the test period, an operator could modify
its initial testing plan and schedule as needed to resolve those problems. Of course, any modified plan or schedule
would still have to provide for completion of testing before the applicable deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed 1-year deadline for MOP reduction or planning and scheduling testing was the same amount of time that
&sect;195.302 allowed for similar activities on the older onshore HVL pipelines. However, the process will involve
more mileage than it did for onshore HVL pipelines. Also, RSPA expects operators will need further planning to maintain
the product-supply requirements of their customers. Therefore, RSPA has extended the proposed planning and scheduling
deadline to 1.5 years in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another operator thought the proposed test period for pre-1970 ERW pipelines was unfair to operators who have many
of these pipelines. These operators would not be able to spread costs and impacts on operations over as much time as
other operators. This commenter suggested that an equitable approach would be to require that operators give pre-1970
ERW pipelines priority in testing over the full test period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA proposed a shorter test period for the pre-1970 ERW pipelines because these pipelines have unique safety problems.
The unique problems cause pre-1970 ERW pipelines to have a greater potential for failure than other older pipelines.
Since pre-1970 ERW pipelines pose a greater risk, requiring operators to test them sooner than other older pipelines
is critical to safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API declared that the proposed testing periods would create an undue hardship on consumers and the pipeline industry.
It suggested RSPA lengthen the period to 10 years for all older pipelines, with testing priorities based on risk. Operators
and shippers need the additional time, API said, so the nation's pipeline network can adapt to the impact of the testing
program on the market. The operators and shippers would use the time to arrange alternative transportation and to
prevent regional supply disruptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using similar reasoning, two operators also urged us to allow more time for testing. One operator thought a reasonable
period would be 7 years for pre-1970 ERW pipelines, and 10 years for the others. The other operator thought the periods
should be 5 and 10 years, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA, too, is concerned about the potential adverse impact on the nation's fuel supplies that could result from testing
thousands of miles of pipelines. Aside from the substantial planning that must be done before testing, many operators
will need time to obtain waste water disposal permits from various jurisdictions. Operators will need time to prepare
pipeline systems for testing and to arrange for personnel and equipment to conduct the tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
System changes and actual testing must be coordinated with product-supply operations to minimize the impact on refineries,
distributors, and users of the transported products. Also, operators need time to assure that testing is done safely,
with the least environmental risk, and in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations. However, RSPA
weighed these time demands in deciding upon the compliance deadlines proposed in the NPRM. None of the commenters
who addressed the compliance-time issue substantiated their opinions that more time should be allowed. Although
it is admittedly difficult to predict how much time is appropriate, the comments do not convince us that there are too
many pre-1970 ERW pipelines to test in 4.5 years or that a decade is needed to complete testing of all other pipelines.
Therefore, the final rule adopts the testing deadlines as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA has not adopted API's suggestion to allow 10 years for all older pipelines, with priorities based on risk, because
the unique problems of pre-1970 ERW pipelines demand correction sooner. Also, considering the mileage involved,
the potential savings from reusing test water, and the need to minimize market impacts, API's suggestion would further
complicate the development of test schedules. Still, the final rule does provide operators flexibility in planning
and scheduling tests. When feasible, operators could use this flexibility to select pipelines for testing according
to leak history or other risk factors. RSPA encourages such testing priorities provided all required testing is completed
within the periods allowed.

Charts or Logs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two operators commenting on proposed &sect;195.406(a)(5) asked us not to limit allowable documentation of prior
tests or operating pressures to recording charts or logs. They said the industry has never had to keep these charts
and logs for older pipelines, and many have been lost. They suggested that the final rule allow alternative documentation,
such as construction specifications, pipeline completion reports, and affidavits from responsible people.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the importance of a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety to the integrity of pipelines, public safety
cannot tolerate doubts about whether a pipeline has been adequately tested. Only recording charts or logs made at
the time of prior testing or operations show with certainty that the minimum margin exists for the pipeline concerned.
Alternative documentation, including specifications, reports, or affidavits, is less probative. Such evidence
leaves some room for doubt because it does not result directly from pipeline testing or operation. Although recording
charts and logs may no longer be available for some older pipelines, RSPA does not believe a lack of proper records justifies
allowing a lesser level of proof for a matter so serious as pipeline integrity. Therefore, the final rule allows only
recording charts or logs to document a prior test or operating pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another operator was concerned that the documentation available for use under the proposed revision of &sect;195.406(a)(5)
may not meet existing &sect;195.310. For example, the operator said calibration data may not be available. Section
195.310 specifies the records operators must keep for each pressure test required by subpart E of part 195. Section
195.310 does not affect the documentation required by existing &sect;195.406(a)(5), and would not affect documentation
under the proposed revision of &sect;195.406(a)(5). Thus, operators need not have documentation under final &sect;195.406(a)(5)
in the same detail as &sect;195.310 requires.

Permits for Disposal of Test Water
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When existing petroleum pipelines are pressure tested hydrostatically, the testing process introduces hydrocarbons
into the test water. If test water picks up unacceptable quantities of hydrocarbons, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) governs its discharge into the environment. (See 40 CFR parts 122&hyph;124.) The NPDES
is a regulatory program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in cooperation with qualified
State agencies under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters were concerned that the procedure of obtaining NPDES permits from State agencies and EPA for treatment
and disposal of test water could significantly delay testing. This potential for delay probably would be limited
to areas where operators do not transport test water to refineries for treatment and discharge, or do not store it for
use in subsequent tests. Although none of the commenters estimated the time that would be needed to secure the NPDES
permits, RSPA has considered this potential for delay in setting deadlines for compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two operators and API suggested that RSPA somehow help the industry in obtaining from EPA a general NPDES permit for
the disposal of treated test water. They also requested our assistance in obtaining a general waiver of the EPA requirement
to measure the toxicity of test water. API said these actions would provide flexibility for efficient scheduling
and implementation of testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has procedures for issuing permits and waivers under its NPDES program. EPA's decisions on applications for permits
and waivers depend on facts known to the industry. Under these circumstances, RSPA believes an operator is the appropriate
party to apply for permits or waivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To hasten the process, RSPA will notify EPA of this final rule. RSPA will urge that agency to give prompt attention to
requests for NPDES permits involving disposal of test water used to comply with the final rule. RSPA will also ask EPA
to request its cooperating State agencies to give prompt attention to requests for permits and waivers.

Smart Pig Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several operators and API recommended that the final rule allow the use of smart pigs (internal inspection devices)
as an alternative to pressure testing for all pipelines, except the pre-1970 ERW pipelines. Two of these operators
said pigging is superior to pressure testing because it shows where potential problems lie. Two operators thought
pigging is better at finding corrosion problems, particularly deep isolated pits that may survive a pressure test.
One operator and API argued that smart pigs could alleviate potential disruptions of service and many environmental
and scheduling problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the capabilities of smart pigs, RSPA knows of no evidence that they can provide satisfactory long-term protection
against the growth of defects. Only a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety between MOP and a previous test or operating
pressure is generally recognized as able to provide this protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various manufacturers have significantly improved the data collection and recording capabilities of smart pigs.
The ability of trained personnel to interpret recorded pig data has also improved. Yet smart pigs still cannot detect
as many pipeline defects that could grow to failure during operation as can an adequate pressure test. Longitudinal
defects, like cracks in a longitudinal weld seam, are particularly resistant to detection by smart pigs. More important,
an adequate pressure test provides a basis for safe operation, with a proven margin of safety against the growth of
defects that survive the test. Smart pigs cannot provide such a margin of safety. Thus, they are not an adequate substitute
for pressure testing in achieving the objectives of this rulemaking proceeding.

Carbon Dioxide Pipelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two operators argued that RSPA should not adopt the proposed rules for older carbon dioxide pipelines, particularly
production field distribution lines. They offered various reasons to exempt carbon dioxide pipelines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Carbon dioxide is non-polluting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The pipelines are relatively new, having been constructed in the 1980s.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The pipelines have been pressure tested hydrostatically, but perhaps not to part 195 standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The failure data used as a basis for the proposed rules did not include carbon dioxide pipelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After hydrostatic pressure testing, carbon dioxide pipelines must be dehydrated, an expensive process that
is not applicable to hazardous liquid pipelines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Pneumatic testing with carbon dioxide or inert gas poses a greater risk than hydrostatic testing because of
the high pressures at which supercritical carbon dioxide pipelines operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The alternative of MOP reduction would dramatically reduce enhanced oil recovery rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for carbon dioxide distribution lines, the two operators said these pipelines generally are smaller than transmission
lines, and only affect isolated areas in oil production fields. The commenters said pressure testing of carbon dioxide
distribution systems would seriously disrupt oil field operations. One of these operators said that over 50 separate
tests may be needed to minimize disruption, depending on the layout of the distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of these comments, RSPA has reviewed both the need to apply the proposed rules to carbon dioxide pipelines and
the burden of compliance. Carbon dioxide pipelines have not been subject to part 195 long enough for us to develop an
accident history for them. Still, because of their similarity to hazardous liquid pipelines, untested or inadequately
tested carbon dioxide pipelines can fail in service from the growth of physical defects, whatever the pipeline's
age. Although carbon dioxide is non-polluting and nonflammable, any failure that releases large quantities of carbon
dioxide would expose nearby persons to the risk of suffocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This risk is less, however, for production field distribution lines that transport carbon dioxide than for transmission
lines that transport carbon dioxide. Compared to transmission lines, which move large volumes of carbon dioxide
over long distances, individual pipelines in a production field distribution system carry smaller volumes over
localized areas. Normally these areas are rural. In addition, the burden of compliance would be greater for field
distribution systems than for transmission lines. Testing field distribution systems could disrupt oil production
and require a multiplicity of tests to minimize that disruption. RSPA believes this combination of decreased risk
and increased burden of compliance justifies excluding from the final rule production field distribution lines
that are in a rural area. As defined in &sect;195.2, the term ``rural area'' means ``outside the limits of any incorporated
or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated residential or commercial area such as a subdivision,
a business or shopping center, or community development.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rules, &sect;195.302(b)(2)(ii) reflects our decision to exclude older carbon dioxide field distribution
lines in rural areas from the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement. Consistent with the present pressure testing
requirement, any portion of these older lines that is replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed on or after July 12,
1991, or any older line converted to carbon dioxide service under &sect;195.5 would have to be pressure tested to at
least 1.25 times its MOP.

Test Pressure

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to redesignate existing &sect;195.302(c), concerning the level and duration of test pressure,
as new &sect;195.303. RSPA received no comments on this proposal, and has adopted it as final. However, the term ``hydrostatic
test'' is replaced by ``pressure test'' because under existing requirements, carbon dioxide pipelines may be pressure
tested either pneumatically or hydrostatically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Test Medium
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most cases, operators must use water as the hydrostatic test medium for hazardous liquid pipelines (&sect;195.306(a)).
However, under specified conditions, onshore pipelines may be tested with petroleum that does not vaporize rapidly
(&sect;195.306(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception allowing operators to use petroleum as the test medium was established when only newly constructed
pipelines were subject to hydrostatic testing under part 195. Newly constructed pipelines are less likely to rupture
during a hydrostatic test than pipelines that have been in operation for a number of years and never tested or inadequately
tested. Therefore, RSPA is concerned that if existing pipelines subject to testing under the final rule were tested
with petroleum, operators would not be able to contain all the petroleum that would spill from ruptures. To preclude
this outcome, RSPA has revised &sect;195.306(b) to prohibit the use of petroleum as a test medium in pressure testing
pipelines to meet the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RSPA's NPRM did not propose to limit the use of petroleum, the NPRM asked operators to estimate the pipeline
mileage they would test with petroleum to learn the extent to which operators might use petroleum instead of water
as the test medium. Only four operators responded, and the answers ranged from none to practically none. Based on this
information and RSPA's experience in administering the hydrostatic testing rules of part 195, disallowing the use
of petroleum as a test medium under the final rule should not significantly affect the burden of compliance with the
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RSPA believes this action is within the scope of the NPRM, because we did not specifically propose it, &sect;195.306(b)
will be effective August 8, 1994, unless by July 7, 1994, RSPA receives comments that illustrate that this final rule
is not in the public interest. Upon receipt of such comments, RSPA will withdraw &sect;195.306(b) before the effective
date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw this section of the final
rule. The other will announce a proposal to disallow the use of petroleum as a test medium for pressure testing required
by this rulemaking and establish a new comment period. If RSPA does not receive comments that illustrate that &sect;195.306(b)
is not in the public interest, RSPA will publish a notice advising that &sect;195.306(b) will be effective on August
8, 1994.

RSPA presented a draft of the NPRM to the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC)
for its consideration at a meeting in Washington, DC on September 14, 1988. THLPSSC is RSPA's statutory advisory committee
for hazardous liquid pipeline safety. It is comprised of 15 members, representing industry, government, and the
public, who are technically qualified to evaluate liquid pipeline safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THLPSSC's discussion of the draft centered on cost of compliance; problems of compliance, such as waste water disposal;
and the smart-pig alternative. THLPSSC voted not to support the draft NPRM primarily because RSPA had not yet demonstrated
that the proposed rules were cost beneficial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At a meeting on September 14, 1989, RSPA updated THLPSSC on the status of the draft NPRM. Committee members discussed
many issues, including product supply to customers, disposal of test water, and the time needed for compliance. Although
no vote was taken, THLPSSC members representing industry indicated agreement with the need to test the older untested
or inadequately tested pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA has decided to adopt final rules in this proceeding despite THLPSSC's negative vote in 1988. RSPA did so because
THLPSSC's primary concern was that the rules be cost beneficial, and the final regulatory evaluation supports that
conclusion. Also, RSPA has addressed THLPSSC's other concerns elsewhere in this preamble in response to similar
concerns raised by commenters. The THLPSSC's reports of the 1988 and 1989 meetings are available in the docket of this

The final rules are worded differently from the proposed rules. However, other than the substantive changes discussed
above, the changes in wording are for editorial or clarification purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several existing rules, the word ``hydrostatic'' or ``hydrostatically'' is replaced by ``pressure,'' because
under subpart E carbon dioxide pipelines may be pressure tested either hydrostatically or pneumatically. Also,
the title of subpart E is changed from ``Hydrostatic Testing'' to ``Pressure Testing.'' In &sect;&sect;195.304(b)
(1) and (2), the word ``hydrostatically'' is not changed to ``pressure,'' because these rules concern factory testing
of components, not post-construction pipeline testing.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively the agencies) are amending their regulations
regarding appraisals of real estate. This final rule is adopted pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule increases to $250,000 the threshold at or below which appraisals are not required pursuant to Title
XI, expands and clarifies existing exemptions to the Title XI appraisal requirement, identifies additional circumstances
when appraisals are not required under Title XI, and specifies when exempt transactions nevertheless require appropriate
evaluations. In addition, the final rule amends existing requirements governing appraisal content and the use of
appraisals prepared by other financial services institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are adopting this final rule to further federal financial and public policy interests by reducing regulatory
burden, while requiring Title XI appraisals when necessary to protect the safety and soundness of financial institutions
or otherwise advance public policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), 12 U.S.C. 3331 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
directs each Federal banking agency to publish appraisal regulations for federally related transactions within
its jurisdiction. The purpose of the legislation is to protect federal financial and public policy interests in real
estate related transactions by requiring that real estate appraisals utilized in connection with federally related
transactions are performed in writing, in accordance with uniform standards, and by individuals whose competency
has been demonstrated and whose professional conduct will be subject to effective supervision. See 12 U.S.C. 3331.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1121(4) of FIRREA, 12 U.S.C. 3350(4), defines a federally related transaction as a real estate-related financial
transaction that is regulated or engaged in by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and requires the
services of an appraiser. A real estate-related financial transaction is defined as any transaction that involves:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The sale, lease, purchase, investment in or exchange of real property, including interests in property, or the
financing thereof;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The refinancing of real property or interests in real property; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The use of real property or interests in real property as security for a loan or investment, including mortgage-backed
securities. See 12 U.S.C. 3350(5) (FIRREA section 1121(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their appraisal regulations, the agencies identify categories of real estate-related financial transactions
that do not require the services of an appraiser in order to protect federal financial and public policy interests
or to satisfy principles of safe and sound banking. These real estate-related financial transactions are not federally
related transactions under the statutory and regulatory definitions. Accordingly, they are subject to neither
Title XI of FIRREA nor those provisions of the agencies' regulations governing appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1992, Congress confirmed that the agencies may set a threshold level below which the services of state
certified or licensed appraisers are not required in connection with federally related transactions if the agencies
determine in writing that the threshold does not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
See Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550, section 954 (amending 12 U.S.C. 3341).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies jointly published a proposed rule to amend their appraisal regulations on June 4, 1993. See 58 FR 31878.
The agencies published a notice of the availability of supplemental information concerning the proposed rule and
invited further comments on November 10, 1993. See 58 FR 59688. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are issuing this joint final rule under their authority to issue rules to implement Title XI of FIRREA
and each agency's authority to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out its responsibility to ensure that the
institutions under its supervision conduct their activities in accordance with safe and sound banking principles.
This final rule is intended to protect federal financial and public policy interests and the safety and soundness
of financial institutions, while reducing duplication, costs and regulatory burden.

B. General Comments on the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Regulated institutions generally endorsed the proposed changes to the appraisal regulations, though a small number
of savings associations, banks, and other commenters opposed changing the regulation. Appraisers almost unanimously
opposed changing the threshold, and a large number of appraisers opposed the business loan exemption. However, appraisers
commented favorably on other parts of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of appraisers commented that the proposed changes would lead to abuses that caused savings associations
to fail in the mid-to-late 1980s and that the changes would violate the intent of Congress. In the experience of the
agencies, and in the opinion of studies conducted on the failures of the 1980s, abuses were related to real estate acquisition
or development projects and larger loans. The regulations issued today continue to require appraisals for these
transactions. Moreover, the regulations fully comply with the intent of Congress by continuing to protect federal
financial and public policy interests in real estate-related financial transactions as well as the safety and soundness
of financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated institutions and appraisers have over three years experience with the appraisal regulations and have
urged changes in the regulations to improve credit availability and reduce duplication, costs, and regulatory burden.
Some commenters, focusing on the proposed threshold, opposed changing the regulations because they believed that
additional time was needed to study the effect of the existing regulations. Delaying the issuance of the final rule
would deny regulated institutions, appraisers, and borrowers the benefits of these changes. To the extent that subsequent
events demonstrate that additional changes are needed, the agencies can further amend the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One appraisal organization suggested that several of the proposed exemptions should be replaced with guidelines
regarding when to obtain Title XI appraisals. Because regulated institutions and appraisers can become liable for
substantial penalties for violating the regulation, the agencies believe that it benefits regulated institutions,
appraisers, and the public for the agencies to identify categories of exempt transactions in the regulation. However,
the agencies intend to provide supplemental information about the appraisal and evaluation practices of regulated
institutions in guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that they were denied an opportunity to comment on the supplemental information identified
in the November 10th notice because the materials were available only in Washington, DC, and the comment period was
30 days. The agencies believe that the public procedures on the proposed amendments to the appraisal regulations
fully complied with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and accorded the public a full opportunity
to participate in the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 10th notice explained that the supplemental materials were available from each of the agencies. In accordance
with established procedures, all agencies mailed copies of those materials to any person requesting them, as well
as having the documents available for review at each agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also believe the 30-day comment period was appropriate for the second comment period on the proposed
amendments. The notice of supplemental information requested comment on materials that dealt almost exclusively
with the appraisal threshold. As shown in Table B above, more than 11,000 comment letters were received in response
to the November 10th notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting the proposed definition of ``business loan'' as a loan or extension of credit to any corporation,
general or limited partnership, business trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship (including
an individual engaged in farming), or other business entity. The definition is used in connection with the exemption
for business loans of $1 million or less that are not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate
as the primary source of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that the agencies amend the definition of business loan to include loans to individuals for
business purposes and to permit use of the exemption when individuals lease real estate to a related business. Loans
to individuals are included in the definition of business loan as loans to sole proprietorships and other business
entities. This exemption does not apply to loans to individuals that are consumer or personal loans. Therefore, the
agencies do not believe that it is necessary to amend the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(h) Real Estate or Real Property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is adding a definition of ``real estate'' and ``real property'' to &sect;225.62 of its regulation. The Board
proposed this amendment to incorporate the definition of real estate and real property employed by the other agencies.
That definition specifically excludes mineral rights, timber rights, growing crops, water rights, and similar
interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XI of FIRREA does not define ``real estate'' or ``real property'' nor does the context in which these terms are
used suggest that the terms are intended to have different technical meanings. See 55 FR 27762 (July 5, 1990).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board used ``real property'' and ``real estate'' interchangeably throughout its appraisal rule to mean interests
in an identified parcel or tract of land and improvements. However, the Board did not intend these terms to include
mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops when they are considered separately from the parcel or tract of land.
Valuation of such interests generally requires the services of a professional other than a real estate appraiser.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify this distinction, the Board has amended its regulation to define ``real property'' and ``real estate''
for purposes of the appraisal regulation as an identified parcel or tract of land, including improvements, easements,
rights of way, undivided or future interests and similar rights in a tract of land, but excluding mineral rights, timber
rights, or growing crops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Few commenters expressed an opinion on this proposed change. Those few commenters who opposed the definition stated
that timber and growing crops should not be excluded from the definition of real estate in that the value of such items
is tied to the value of the land. Comments opposing this definition were generally from appraisers who perform farm
and timber appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many states, minerals, timber, and growing crops that have not been severed from the land are considered interests
in real estate or real property. Consequently, if mineral rights are collateral for a loan in one of those states, a
question arises whether the institution must obtain a real estate appraisal of the parcel or tract of land to which
the mineral rights are attached but in which the institution has no interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's final rule clarifies that regulated institutions are not required to obtain appraisals of the parcel
of land to which mineral rights, or similar severable interests in real estate are attached, if the transaction only
involves the severable interest rather than the parcel or tract of land. Where mineral rights, timber rights, or growing
crops, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the associated parcel or tract of land, are the subject of a real estate-related financial transaction, the services
of a licensed or certified appraiser would be required unless the transaction is otherwise exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the contribution of relevant mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops should be included when
appraising a parcel of land which possesses any of these features. However, valuation of these interests would not
be required if they are not part of the transaction or if they are not relevant to the analyses which the appraiser needs
to perform to arrive at an estimate of value for the parcel or tract of land.

(1) Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies proposed an increase from $100,000 to $250,000 in the threshold at or below which a Title XI appraisal
is not required, and specifically asked commenters whether a $250,000 or some other threshold would be appropriate.
In addition, the agencies requested information on loss experience of depository institutions for loans greater
than $250,000 and loans of $250,000 or less. On November 10, 1993, the agencies made available supplemental information
on the proposed rule and extended the comment period for 30 days in order to allow commenters to consider and comment
on the information. The supplemental information related primarily to the proposed increase in the threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters addressed the threshold issue. Almost all of the commenters opposed to the increase were
appraisers, while almost all of the commenters in favor of the increase were depository institutions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of those opposed stated as the basis for their opposition that an increase in the threshold would cause substantial
losses for depository institutions, and thereby for the deposit insurance funds. To support this view, commenters
generally cited the thrift failures of the 1980s and asserted that an increase in the threshold would lead to the same
result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 74 comment letters provided data on loss experience. The institutions providing the data varied in size,
and included large regional multi-bank holding companies, as well as small banks. This data is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons set forth below, the agencies have decided to raise the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000. Such an
increase will benefit consumers and lenders and will not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions,
particularly as an evaluation will be required for all loans exempt under the threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefits for Consumers and Lenders of an Increase in the Threshold. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters stated that an increase in the threshold would benefit consumers and lenders. Numerous bank and thrift
commenters pointed to the cost and time needed in order to obtain an appraisal as an impediment to lending. The appraisal
was cited by several commenters as the most important factor causing delay in small business lending, and the cost
of the appraisal was described as high, especially for commercial borrowers. Commenters reported that appraisal
fees for commercial transactions between $100,000 and $250,000 could cost 5 percent of the loan amount to the borrower.
Banks and thrifts also commented that increasing the threshold would reduce regulatory burden associated with making
loans below $250,000. Many appraisers, however, commented that appraisal costs have remained relatively steady.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many appraisers also stated that appraisals by certified or licensed appraisers are necessary to protect the consumer.
The agencies believe that this assertion mischaracterizes the role of the institution's determination of collateral
value in a typical consumer transaction. The regulated institution obtains the appraisal or evaluation as part of
its loan underwriting process in order to make certain that it is adequately secured. Any appraisal ordered by a financial
institution is not designed, and generally comes too late, to assist the consumer in negotiating a contract price.
In a purchase of real estate, the purchase offer is generally made before financing is sought and the financial institution
orders an appraisal. Therefore, the appraisal represents an after-the-fact cost. Further, even when a Title XI appraisal
is not required, nothing prevents a consumer from independently obtaining an appraisal by a licensed or certified
appraiser for the consumer's own use in the negotiating process. Moreover, the agencies' rules require an institution
to obtain an appropriate evaluation of the real property collateral for transactions below the threshold, and that
evaluation would be available to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that many of the concerns about consumer protection are addressed under statutory and regulatory
programs other than Title XI of FIRREA, which focuses on bank and thrift safety and soundness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) establishes procedures for lenders to disclose to consumers the
charges for a variety of settlement services, including appraisals and evaluations. To comply with the letter and
intent of the Board's Regulation B (implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act), regulated institutions must
either disclose to the borrower the right to receive a copy of the documents the lender uses to value the collateral
in an application for a loan secured by a dwelling, regardless of whether the documents constitute a Title XI appraisal
or evaluation, or, as a matter of course provide the borrower with the appraisal or evaluation. Thus, to the extent
that a borrower benefits from knowing the value the lender places on the property the borrower has contracted to purchase
or pledged as collateral, the borrower should be able to benefit from that knowledge whether it is in the form of a Title
XI appraisal or an evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, although such a disclosure is not required by RESPA, Regulation B, or Title XI, the agencies believe
that a regulated institution should advise consumers whether the institution intends to have a licensed or certified
appraiser prepare the estimate of value. This should be done early enough in the loan application process to allow
the consumer to make an informed decision that the intended method of estimating the real estate's value meets his
or her needs.

Effects on Safety and Soundness of Financial Institutions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies have concluded that a $250,000 threshold would not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benefits to Safety and Soundness. The agencies believe that the increase in the threshold will have affirmative benefits
for safety and soundness. A decrease in appraisal requirements should relieve regulatory burden for banks and thrifts
and thereby improve their competitiveness with non-regulated lenders. Appraisal costs represent a significant
expense for certain small loans, making such lending less attractive to a potential borrower or less profitable for
the lender. Numerous comments from lenders supported this conclusion. The problem is particularly troubling for
lenders in small towns, who must pay a premium for a licensed or certified appraiser to visit the town. A GAO survey of
bankers in connection with a study of small business lending revealed that the minimum cost to perform the necessary
appraisal on commercial real estate property used as collateral for small business loans was approximately $3,000.

Experience with the $100,000 Threshold. The Board has had a $100,000 threshold in place since August 1990, and the
other agencies have had a $100,000 threshold since March or April 1992. The experience of the agencies has demonstrated
that the $100,000 threshold has posed no risk to safety and soundness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 no bank or thrift has failed or suffered significant losses as a result of appraisal problems with loans under $100,000
or even up to $250,000. Each of the regional representatives of the Board, the FDIC, and the OCC supported adoption
of the $250,000 threshold as consistent with safety and soundness. Representatives of the OTS suggested that the
threshold should only apply to healthier thrifts. As described below, this concern has been addressed by the agencies
in the final regulation.

The Central Region of the OTS was the only OTS respondent to identify failures attributable to inadequate appraisal
practices. The Central Region identified fewer than six failures over the previous twelve years where appraisal
issues for loans under $250,000 were a major contributing factor to a thrift's failure. The Central Region noted that
in those failures where inadequate appraisal practices were a problem, other areas of loan underwriting were usually
found to be equally deficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One OCC survey respondent reported that one institution had failed because of residential and commercial loans between
$100,000 and $500,000. The respondent noted that the problems occurred before 1987, when the OCC issued guidelines
that would have prevented the institution's real estate valuation problems.

The $250,000 threshold was also supported by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), the professional association
for state officials who supervise and regulate state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The CSBS concluded
that the increased threshold would reduce unnecessary costs and would not represent a threat to the safety and soundness
of financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous bank and thrift commenters also reported that their experience with the $100,000 threshold had been good.
Moreover, commenters opposed to the increased threshold did not identify institutions that had failed or suffered
significant losses because of the existence of the $100,000 threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that low loss experience with a $100,000 threshold provides justification for an increase in
the threshold to $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data Indicate Similarities Between the $100,000 Threshold and $250,000 Threshold. A substantial body of evidence
provides strong reasons to believe that exempting loans between $100,000 and $250,000 from the Title XI appraisal
requirement will not present materially greater risk than the prior exemption for loans under $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) for year-end 1992 show
that approximately 53 percent of the dollar volume of all real estate-secured loans of all sizes in the commercial
banking industry are loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from the Thrift Financial Reports (TFR) for year-end 1992 show that the number is 77 percent in the thrift industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on loan size are not reported for residential loans on the Call Report or TFR. However, information from the National
Association of Realtors, the Census Bureau, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicate that
approximately 29 percent of the dollar volume of 1-to-4 family real estate loans to purchase new homes, and 33 percent
of the dollar volume of loans to finance the purchase of existing homes, fell below the prior $100,000 threshold. Approximately
56 percent of the dollar volume for new 1-to-4 family homes and 49 percent of the dollar volume for existing homes fell
between $100,000 and $250,000. In sum, 85 percent of the dollar volume of mortgages financing new homes and 82 percent
of the volume of mortgages financing purchases of existing homes will fall below the $250,000 threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, increasing the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 is likely to more than double the amount of lending for 1-to-4
family residential real estate loans exempt from the Title XI appraisal requirement. Inasmuch as a solid majority
of total real estate lending is composed of 1-to-4 family loans, the agencies believe that 1-to-4 family loans will
be the largest block of loans exempted by the increase in the threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in 1-to-4 family residential real estate loans exempted by the $250,000 threshold will not affect safety
and soundness, as these loans are traditionally the safest in a lending institution's portfolio. In 1992, the net
loan charge-off rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for all commercial bank loans secured by 1-to-4 family real estate was 0.23 percent; for thrifts, the net charge-off
rate for loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential real estate was 0.22 percent. Low loss rates for 1-to-4 family
residential real estate loans predate enactment of Title XI; for example, in 1991, when the great majority of 1-to-4
family loans had been originated prior to implementation of Title XI in August 1990, the charge-off rate for 1-to-4
family loans was 0.20 percent for commercial banks and 0.11 percent for thrifts. See FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile
(4th Quarter 1991) and Thrift Financial Reports (1991).

Beginning June 30, 1993, commercial banks and thrifts are required to report annually the number and dollar amount
of non-farm non-residential real estate loans, which basically constitute business loans secured by real estate.
They are also required to report the number and dollar amount of all agricultural loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data from the June 1993 Call Reports show that 12 percent of the dollar volume of real estate-secured business loans
was below the $100,000 threshold. Also by dollar volume, only 11 percent of outstanding real estate-secured business
loans fell between $100,000 and $250,000. For thrifts, the TFRs show that 10 percent of the dollar volume of all real-estate
secured business loans was below $100,000, and 9 percent between $100,000 and $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These findings are consistent with data compiled in the 1989 National Survey of Small Business Finances, which surveyed
firms with fewer than 500 employees. See National Survey of Small Business Finances (1989) (cosponsored by the Federal
Reserve Board and Small Business Administration). According to that survey, of the commercial mortgages to small
businesses by depository institutions, 6 percent of the dollar volume of these loans was in loans of less than $100,000,
and 12 percent was in loans between $100,000 and $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the regional examiner surveys, the $100,000 threshold has not resulted in significant losses, even though
that threshold captures 12 percent of the dollar volume of small business loans. The agencies do not believe that an
increase in the threshold that exempts another 11 percent of business loans will significantly increase such losses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Call Report data also show that 63 percent of the dollar volume of agricultural real estate loans fell below the $100,000
threshold, and that 15 percent fell between $100,000 and $250,000. For thrifts, TFR data show that 46 percent of farm
loans fell below $100,000, and 36 percent between $100,000 and $250,000. Farm loans represented approximately one-half
of one percent (.58%) of non-residential mortgages held by thrifts. Thus, in the area of farm loans, only a relatively
small amount of additional loans will be exempted by the raised threshold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the increase in the threshold will increase the dollar volume of exempt transactions, the agencies believe
that the quality of loans and lending practices of banks and thrifts will not change for these transactions. Moreover,
an institution must obtain evaluations for these exempt transactions when it does not obtain appraisals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there is evidence that the loss rates on loans below the $250,000 threshold will be low. For 1992, the commercial
bank loss rate for farm loans was .23 percent (approximately the same loss rate as for 1-to-4 family loans). These loss
rates on residential and farm loans are significantly lower than the loss rates for the types of real estate loans that
are much less likely to fall below the $250,000 threshold_construction loans (3.54% loss rate for commercial banks)
and multifamily loans (1.68% loss rate for commercial banks). Loss rates for non-farm non-residential real estate
loans at commercial banks were 1.55 percent, higher than residential or farm loans, but still below the loss rates
experienced for loans for construction or multifamily housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in addition to the relatively lower risk of the portfolio of real estate related loans between $100,000 and
$250,000, the fact remains that the dollar amount of each credit is relatively small. In the experience of the agencies,
banks and thrifts generally do not fail because of real estate-related financial transactions under $250,000. It
is generally large construction and development loans that have created safety and soundness problems. For example,
much of the thrift losses of the 1980s were caused by losses in large, speculative real estate development projects,
such as construction of offices, condominiums, and apartments. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GAO Report AFMD 89&hyph;62, Thrift Failures: Costly Failures Resulted from Regulatory Violations and Unsafe Practices.
Such projects generally involve loans in much greater amounts than $250,000. The experience of the agencies continues
to be that larger development and construction loans are most likely to cause significant losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although many commenters suggested that raising the threshold would result in losses similar to those of the thrift
failures of the 1980s, they did not offer analysis to support those statements. The agencies do not believe that inadequate
appraisals on loans under $250,000 were a significant cause of those failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional Protections. Significant protections exist so that loans under $250,000 will not create a safety and
soundness problem once the $250,000 threshold is in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, each agency will, during each required full-scope, on-site examination, analyze the prudence of each institution's
credit underwriting practices, including appraisal and evaluation practices, as appropriate to the institution's
size and nature of its real estate-related activities. If an institution is doing a poor job of evaluating real estate
for transactions under $250,000, then the appropriate agency may order the institution to obtain appraisals for
certain loans or for all loans above a certain amount that are not subject to another exemption.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted below, the agencies may require an appraisal for loans between $100,000 and $250,000 (not otherwise subject
to an exemption) when an institution is in troubled condition, and that troubled condition is attributable to underwriting
problems in the institution's real estate loan portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, even though a bank or thrift will not generally be required to obtain a Title XI appraisal for real estate-secured
loans under $250,000, the institution must determine the value of the real estate before making the loan. Under the
appraisal regulations, banks and thrifts must support any transaction below the threshold with an evaluation that
is consistent with the agencies' guidelines. Evaluations will be performed by persons who are capable of rendering
an appropriate estimate of value of real estate as a result of their real estate-related experience or training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As several commenters noted, a $250,000 threshold will have its greatest effect in smaller communities where property
values are lower. However, as many community bank commenters pointed out, local lenders in small communities tend
to be extremely knowledgeable of property values. Also, collateral for loans of this size do not typically represent
complex problems of analysis or valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a $250,000 threshold does not prevent the use of appraisals when needed. Banks and thrifts may obtain appraisals
prepared by licensed or certified appraisers whenever the institutions believe it is prudent, and customer may independently
obtain such appraisals. If, as some commenters contend, history demonstrates that such appraisals are important
to the decision to lend and the failure to obtain such an appraisal will lead to higher loss rates, then banks and thrifts
would presumably have a strong incentive to use appraisals. As several commenters noted, institutions will obtain
appraisals when their underwriting criteria warrant one, regardless of whether regulations require it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, in many cases involving residential real estate, banks and thrifts will be required to obtain the equivalent
of a Title XI appraisal in order to make the loan eligible for sale in the secondary market. According to HUD data, in
1992, secondary mortgage market purchasers, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), purchased approximately 63 percent of all 1-to-4 family
mortgages originated in the United States. In addition to the 63 percent that were purchased by major secondary mortgage
market entities, other loans were originated so as to be eligible for sale to such entities. The agencies have concluded
that the appraisal requirements of these government sponsored agencies should protect federal financial and public
policy interests in the loans that are eligible to be purchased by them. The agencies also believe that compliance
with these appraisal requirements will protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions.

Data Submitted by Commenters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice of proposed rulemaking asked commenters to submit loan loss data for different categories of real estate-secured
loans above and below $250,000. Many depository institution commenters noted that they do not maintain loss data
by loan size and that this information is not reasonably accessible. Only a small number of depository institutions
submitted such data. The agencies do not believe that this response is sufficiently large to base any conclusions
about industry-wide conditions. Nonetheless, the agencies note that the information provided by commenters is
consistent with the low loss rates for real estate lending indicated by other sources. The responses that the agencies
received are summarized in the following table.

Additional Comments on the $250,000 Threshold_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB Study. Several commenters opposing an increase in the threshold pointed to an August 1992 study by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) entitled Report to Congress: De Minimis Levels for Commercial Real Estate Appraisals.
The OMB study did not oppose an increase in the threshold level but instead stated, ``OMB does not recommend_at this
time_a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level higher than $100,000.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' OMB study at i.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that the major concerns identified by the OMB in urging delay have been addressed with the passage
of time. Most importantly, each of the agencies now has an additional year's experience with the $100,000 threshold.
Furthermore, OMB noted that FIRREA's appraisal requirements had not been implemented in all states, but such implementation
has now occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking Process. Several commenters stated that the agencies had failed to justify increasing the threshold
from $100,000 to $250,000 because the agencies had not produced a definitive study showing that doing so would not
increase loss rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress granted the agencies explicit authority to establish a threshold consistent with safety and soundness.
The delegation of authority was broad, and no requirement for quantitative analysis was included. Nor is it reasonably
feasible for the agencies to conduct a definitive quantitative analysis that isolates the effect of obtaining Title
XI appraisals on institutions' losses on real estate-secured loans given the many variables, including changing
market conditions and varying loan underwriting practices, that may affect institutions' ultimate loss experience.
For the same reason, the agencies did not conduct a random sampling of the experience of financial institutions, as
suggested by one commenter. This does not mean, however, that the final rule fails to rely on objective data. Moreover,
that data was analyzed in light of the agencies' experience and expertise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this rulemaking, the agencies reviewed the data the agencies currently collect from financial institutions
and sought out data that would enable the agencies to analyze the effect of the threshold on regulated institutions.
Consistent with statutory requirements, the agencies have carefully considered the effect of raising the threshold
and determined that a $250,000 threshold level does not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial
institutions based on the agencies' judgment, expertise, and experience. In making this determination, the agencies
have, as described above, analyzed the available data, the comments received during the rulemaking, and relevant
work of other governmental agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appraiser Employment. Many commenters from the appraisal industry objected to the proposed increase in the threshold
on the grounds that it would decrease their business and employment in the appraisal industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that an appraisal is not required because the transaction falls below $250,000, the appraisal regulation
nonetheless requires that an evaluation of the property be conducted. The agencies' appraisal rules do not impede
licensed and certified appraisers from performing these evaluations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAO Study. Several commenters suggested that the agencies delay action on any rulemaking pending completion of General
Accounting Office (GAO) studies of the threshold scheduled for completion in April 1994 and October 1995. Congress
delegated authority to the agencies to establish a threshold in the same legislation that directed the GAO to conduct
two studies of the appraisal threshold. Congress clearly did not require the agencies to withhold action on the threshold
pending completion of the GAO studies; nor did it make agency action contingent on the outcome of the GAO studies or
any other studies. Also, in the Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability issued March 10, 1993, the agencies
identified a need to reexamine their existing appraisal rules to make certain that thresholds below which formal
appraisals are not needed are reasonable. Therefore, the agencies believe that it is appropriate to proceed with
the rulemaking. The agencies are cooperating with the GAO by providing information that it may use in preparing its
studies.

Private Mortgage Insurance Industry Experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A trade association representing the private mortgage insurance industry opposed increasing the threshold level
to $250,000, citing substantial losses on loans under $100,000. However, it also noted that for loans originated
in 1984, loans above $250,000 had a relative claim rate more than 50 percent higher than the claim rate for loans originated
under $100,000. Information provided by this commenter also showed that the relative claim rates on loans below $100,000
and loans between $100,000 and $250,000 were close for most years, while the relative claim rate for loans above $250,000
exceeded the claim rates for loans below $250,000 in all years except one. The commenter did not provide actual claim
rates nor dollar amounts of claims. Nor did the commenter disclose the average loan-to-value ratios for those mortgages,
a factor that could affect the loss experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the trade association stated its belief that a significant amount of the claims experienced by its members
were related to inadequate appraisals, bank and thrift commenters stated that losses on foreclosed properties were
more directly related to deterioration in the local real estate market, damage to the property, or actions or inaction
by the borrower.

Application of $100,000 Threshold to Certain Troubled Institutions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in more detail below, the agencies are adopting substantially as proposed a separate amendment stating
that each agency continues to reserve the right to require a regulated institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal whenever
the agency believes that an appraisal is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. This authority may involve
the agency requiring an institution to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit or an entire group
of credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether an institution will be required, pursuant to this provision or existing safety and soundness authority,
to obtain an individual appraisal or group of appraisals may depend on the condition of that institution. If an institution's
troubled condition is attributable to real estate loan underwriting problems, then the appropriate agency may require
appraisals for all new real estate-related transactions of more than $100,000 that are not subject to an exemption.

A ``problem'' association is defined as an association that: (1) Has a composite MACRO rating of 4 or 5; (2) is undercapitalized
under prompt corrective action standards; (3) is subject to a capital directive or a cease and desist order, a consent
order, or a formal written agreement, relating to the safety and soundness or financial viability of the savings association,
unless otherwise informed in writing by the OTS; or (4) has been notified in writing by the OTS that is has been designated
a problem association or an association in troubled condition. (See Regulatory Bulletin 27a, Executive Compensation.)

then the agencies will reassess that threshold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The ``Abundance of Caution'' Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are amending their regulations to clarify and expand the scope of the exemption for real estate liens
taken in an ``abundance of caution.'' Under the amended rule, regulated institutions will be able to apply the abundance
of caution exemption to a broader range of transactions in which real estate is taken as additional collateral for
an extension of credit that is well supported by income or other collateral of the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to adoption of this amendment, the abundance of caution exemption was available only for transactions in which
a lien on real estate had been taken as collateral solely through an abundance of caution and where the terms of the transaction
as a consequence had not been made more favorable than they would have been in the absence of a lien. In the agencies'
experience, however, this standard was being interpreted too narrowly. As a result, regulated institutions obtained
appraisals even though they were unnecessary to protect federal financial and public policy interests in the transaction
or bank and thrift safety and soundness. Further, a transaction would not qualify for the exemption if the regulated
institution made the terms more favorable to the borrower because of the real estate collateral. Therefore, bankers
believed they were unable to use this exemption when common business practices would call for a lower interest rate
on a secured loan than an unsecured loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To qualify for the amended exemption, the regulated institution's decision to enter into the transaction must be
well supported by the borrower's income or collateral other than real estate. The following examples from the proposed
rule help to explain how this standard is applied. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A business with an established cash flow seeks a loan from a regulated institution to purchase an adjacent property
for expansion. As a common business practice, the institution takes a lien against real estate whenever available
for greater comfort. However, the institution's analysis determines that the current income from the business and
personal property available as collateral support the decision to extend credit without knowing the real estate's
market value. During loan negotiations, the institution offers to make the loan on slightly better terms for the borrower
if it receives a lien on real estate. The borrower accepts the offer and provides the real estate as additional collateral.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated institution may reasonably conclude that the lien on the real estate was taken in an abundance of caution
because the current income from the business and personal property taken as collateral support the decision to extend
credit. Therefore, no appraisal would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner of a shop seeks a term loan from a regulated institution for modernization of its facilities. The institution
determines that other sources of repayment and collateral do not sufficiently support the decision to extend credit
without taking a lien on the real estate and knowing the real estate's market value. Therefore, in order to extend credit
to the borrower prudently, the institution needs an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated institution should conclude that the real estate lien has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
been taken in an abundance of caution because the other sources of repayment and collateral do not support the decision
to extend credit without knowing the real estate's market value. This transaction would not qualify for the abundance
of caution exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated institutions generally supported the proposed amendment. Some commenters representing appraisers
agreed that the abundance of caution exemption had been too narrowly interpreted and supported the proposal to extend
the scope of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other appraisers commented that the agencies should require an appraisal, limited scope appraisal, or evaluation
any time a regulated institution takes real estate as collateral. Some regulated institutions noted that the prior
rule caused them to forgo liens on real estate collateral in order to avoid the expense of an appraisal, thus potentially
increasing their exposure unnecessarily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are not requiring appraisals for these transactions because an estimate of the real estate collateral's
value generally would not assist the regulated institution to make its lending decision. Therefore, an appraisal
generally would not further the purposes of Title XI of FIRREA nor significantly improve the safety and soundness
of financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a uniform exemption for transactions that are not secured by real estate. The exemption
makes clear that a regulated institution is not required to obtain a Title XI real estate appraisal in connection with
a loan used to acquire or invest in real estate if the institution does not take a security interest in real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prior appraisal regulations of the OCC, FDIC and OTS exempted these transactions, and the amendment does not result
in any substantive change in regulatory requirements for these agencies. The amendment eliminates minor differences
between the text of the rules adopted by the OCC and OTS and the text of the FDIC's rule. Prior to adoption of the amendment,
the Board's appraisal regulation did not specifically exempt these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a few appraisers stated that Title XI appraisals should be obtained for these transactions, other commenters,
including appraisers, supported this exemption. Several commenters stated that Title XI was never intended to reach
transactions that were not secured by real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In transactions covered by this exemption, the value of the real estate has no direct effect on the regulated institution's
decision to extend credit because the institution has no security interest in the real estate. The agencies conclude
that federal financial and public policy interests would not be served by requiring lenders and borrowers to incur
the cost of obtaining Title XI appraisals in connection with these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Liens for Purposes Other Than the Real Estate's Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a new exemption for transactions in which a regulated institution takes a lien on real estate
for a purpose other than the value of the real estate. This amendment will permit regulated institutions to take liens
against real estate to protect rights to, or control over, collateral other than the real estate without obtaining
an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated institutions frequently take real estate liens to protect legal rights to other collateral and not because
of the value of the real estate as an individual asset. For example, in lending associated with logging operations,
a regulated institution typically takes a lien against the real estate upon which the timber stands to ensure its access
to the timber in the event of default. Similarly, where the collateral for a loan is a business or manufacturing facility,
a regulated institution may take a lien against the land and improvements in order to be able to sell the entire business
or facility as a going concern if the borrower defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Title XI appraisal contains an opinion of the market value of real estate. When the market value of the real estate
as an individual asset is not needed to support the regulated institution's decision to lend, no purpose is served
by requiring the institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally favored adopting an exemption addressing these circumstances, agreeing that Title XI appraisals
did not enhance the safety and soundness of these transactions because the lenders were basing their decision to extend
credit on the value of collateral other than real estate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that this exemption could be combined with the abundance of caution exemption. Although
there are situations in which the two exemptions overlap, the agencies believe that both exemptions are necessary
because there will be transactions that qualify for one exemption, but not the other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Real Estate-Secured Business Loans of $1 Million or Less
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a new exemption for business loans with a value of $1 million or less where the sale of, or rental
income derived from, real estate is not the primary source of repayment. The agencies also are adopting the proposed
definition of ``business loan'' as a loan or extension of credit to any corporation, general or limited partnership,
business trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship (including an individual engaged in farming),
or other business entity. This provision allows a regulated institution to take real estate as security in connection
with a loan to a small- or medium-sized business when the primary source of repayment for the loan does not depend on
sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule differs in two respects from the proposed rule. First, the exemption is available for business loans
of $1 million or less. The proposed rule would have exempted business loans less than $1 million. The change was adopted
to reduce confusion by making this provision consistent with the way other limits are treated in the rule. The change
affects the scope of the exemption very slightly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, under the final rule, the exemption is available for business loans that do not depend on real estate sales
and rental income as the primary source of repayment for the loan. The proposed rule would have exempted business loans
that were not dependent on sale of, or rental income derived from, the real estate taken as collateral as the primary
source of repayment. The change narrows the scope of the exemption by preventing a borrower from qualifying for the
exemption by showing that the primary source of repayment for the loan is income from real estate sales and rentals
involving real estate other than the real estate in which the lender has a security interest. This means, for example,
that a real estate developer cannot qualify for the exemption by showing that a real estate-secured loan for one project,
in which the lender has taken a security interest, will be repaid with income from real estate sales or rentals from
other real estate projects, in which the lender does not have a security interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following examples illustrate the application of this exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner of a shop seeks a term loan for $1 million or less from a regulated institution. The loan will be repaid with
income derived from operations. The regulated institution would not extend credit to the borrower without a lien
against the real estate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because the loan is for $1 million or less and the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate is not
the primary source of repayment, a Title XI appraisal would not be required for this transaction under this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A company acquires an adjacent parcel of land to construct an office building. The company seeks a loan of $1 million
or less from a regulated institution to provide construction financing and a permanent mortgage for the office building.
The company intends to lease part of the building and will use the rental income to help repay the loan. The lender estimates
that operations of the business would contribute approximately 45 percent of the funds necessary to repay the loan
and rental income approximately 55 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated institution should conclude that rental income derived from real estate serves as the primary source
of repayment for the loan. Therefore, assuming no other exemption is applicable to the transaction, a Title XI appraisal
would be required.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Increased Lending to Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the experience of the agencies, the appraisal requirement may have adversely affected the ability of small- and
medium-sized businesses to obtain credit. In particular, there are indications that the cost of an appraisal may
impede small- and medium-sized businesses from receiving working capital, operating loans, and other business-related
credits that otherwise would be consistent with prudent banking practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of financial institutions and financial institution trade associations that responded to the agencies'
request for comment on the effect of the business loan exemption on credit availability stated that the proposed exemption
would increase credit availability by reducing the cost and time to make real estate-secured business loans. These
commenters generally stated that the changes would have the most significant effect on credit availability for small-
and medium-sized businesses. Some appraisers also stated that the proposed changes would increase credit availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of commenters responding to the specific request for comment thought that the changes would have no
effect on credit availability. These commenters included appraisers and appraiser trade associations, a small
number of financial institutions, and other commenters. Some of these commenters stated that the ability of financial
institutions to earn a reasonable return by making relatively risk-free investments in U.S. government securities
was the cause of credit availability problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that the final rule may reduce the cost of real estate-secured loans to small- and medium-sized
businesses and increase the availability of loans to these borrowers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect on Safety and Soundness.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters stated that this exemption would eliminate the requirement to obtain Title XI appraisals for a large
portion of the real estate-secured business loans in their communities. Others stated that this exemption raised
safety and soundness concerns because the only tangible collateral for many businesses is real estate. Though real
estate may be an important asset of many small- and medium-sized businesses, the agencies have concluded that this
exemption for certain business loans that do not rely on real estate as the primary source of repayment will not threaten
the safety and soundness of regulated institutions nor pose a threat to federal financial and public policy interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agencies are not requiring Title XI appraisals in connection with these business loans, the agencies
are requiring regulated institutions to obtain appropriate evaluations of the real estate collateral. The evaluation
should provide the institution with sufficient information on the value of the real estate to satisfy principles
of safe and sound banking. In addition, during each required full-scope, on-site examination, each agency will analyze
the prudence of each institution's credit underwriting practices, including appraisal and evaluation practices,
as appropriate to the institution's size and nature of its real estate-related activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shortly after the agencies issued the proposed rule, the GAO completed its report entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Impediments to Small Business Lending Should Be Removed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (September 1993). In the report's summary, the GAO stated: ``Specifically, we believe that real estate appraisal
requirements can be safely modified when applied to collateral taken as supplementary support for traditional small
business loans. Therefore, we agree with those aspects of the rule changes recently proposed by the banking regulators
to expand the exemptions from mandatory appraisals as they pertain to such loans.'' The GAO noted that the report and
its comment on the proposed appraisal regulations were limited ``to situations in which real estate collateral is
used to support loans to small businesses for such purposes as working capital and equipment purchases.'' This exemption
is intended to reach these loans, as well as loans for other business purposes where sale of, or rental income derived
from, real estate is not the primary source of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusion that exempting these transactions will not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions
is supported by responses to a 1993 OCC survey of its senior examining staff. The survey asked for information on the
effect of the proposed business loan exemption on bank safety and soundness, as well as information on the significance,
by loan size, of losses on loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential real estate and other categories of real estate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen of the 20 respondents to the OCC survey stated that the proposed exemption for business loans would not threaten
the safety and soundness of financial institutions, although some respondents noted that the exemption could present
more serious risks for small financial institutions. Respondents to the survey identified loans above $1 million
secured by non-residential real estate as the category of transactions that had the most significant losses attributable
to inadequate appraisals, followed by loans secured by non-residential real estate in the ranges $750,000 to $1 million
and $500,000 to $750,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, respondents noted that where real estate serves as only a secondary source of repayment for a business
loan, an evaluation of the collateral would be sufficient to address safety and soundness issues. Although the other
bank regulatory agencies' surveys did not include the specific questions posed in the OCC survey, the results of the
other bank regulatory agencies' surveys also generally support the business loan exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the survey responses, the data from the 1992 commercial bank Call Reports and savings associations'
TFR indicate that the exposure to the banking system from these transactions is limited. All commercial loans secured
by non-farm non-residential real estate in the range between $250,000 and $1 million (this includes both non-exempt
and exempt transactions) represent less than 4 percent of all loans for commercial banks and less than 3 percent of
all loans for savings associations. Furthermore, these loans represent less than 27 percent of commercial loans
secured by non-farm non-residential real estate at commercial banks and less than 36 percent of commercial loans
secured by such real estate at savings associations. This generally agrees with the National Survey of Small Business
Finances (1989), cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and Small Business Administration. The results of the
survey (adjusted to 1992 dollars) show that 22 percent of all commercial mortgages were for amounts between $250,000
and $1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies requested specific comment on loss experience for real estate-secured business loans. Only a small
number of banks and no thrifts submitted the requested data. Although the agencies do not believe the response is large
enough to reach conclusions about industry-wide loss experience, the data submitted is consistent with the conclusion
that regulated institutions are not suffering high levels of losses in connection with real estate-secured business
loans of $1 million or less that do not depend on real estate sales or rental income as the primary source of repayment.
The responses that the agencies received are summarized in the following table.

The exemption applies only to transactions involving business loans with a value of $1 million or less. Capping the
exemption at $1 million serves two purposes. It helps to ensure that the transactions involve small- and medium-sized
businesses. It also limits the overall exposure of the banking system to transactions exempt under this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulated institutions typically are subject to capital-based lending limits that restrict the amount of credit
they can extend to any one borrower. While a $1 million business loan may be much more significant to a smaller institution,
the agencies believe that a second capital-based limit in the appraisal regulation is inappropriate because it can
place smaller institutions at a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions. In addition, the agencies regularly
examine the lending practices of all regulated institutions and can address problems with individual institutions
if they arise. The agencies believe it is appropriate, however, to place a limit on the size of loan that can qualify
for this exemption. Many commenters agreed that a $1 million dollar limit was appropriate.

 Some commenters suggested that the exemption should be available only if the borrower could repay the loan entirely
from sources other than sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate. Commenters also suggested specific percentage
limits on the contribution of real estate to repayment of the loan ranging from 10 to 50 percent. Other commenters stated
that the exemption should allow a regulated institution to determine whether a business loan requires an appraisal,
regardless of the contribution of real estate sales or rental income to the borrower's repayment of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption is intended to improve the ability of small- and medium-sized businesses to obtain real estate-secured
loans for business purposes. As the contribution of real estate sales and rentals to the borrower's sources for repaying
the loan increases, repayment becomes more dependent on the performance of the real estate market. Therefore, in
deciding whether a transaction qualifies for this exemption, regulated institutions should be guided by the importance
of the real estate-related sources of income to the borrower's repayment of the loan, rather than applying a universal
numerical cap. In no case, however, may a business loan qualify for this exemption if real estate-related sources
of income contribute more toward repayment of the loan than non-real estate sources of income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempting these business loans will reduce the adverse effects on small- and medium-sized business lending associated
with the requirement to obtain a Title XI appraisal. Moreover, since repayment of these loans generally will not depend
primarily on the performance of the real estate markets, allowing lenders to make these business loans on the basis
of evaluations of the real estate collateral does not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

Agricultural Lending. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies received comment letters from appraisers in rural areas who stated that the exemption should not apply
to agricultural production loans because use of the real estate generates the income for repayment of the loan. For
any transaction exempt under this provision, the regulated institution is responsible for documenting that the
borrower's sources of income are not primarily dependent upon the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate.
The agencies do not view the sale of growing crops as the sale of real estate, nor as providing rental income derived
from real estate. The agencies have concluded that transactions involving agricultural operations present no greater
risk than other types of business operations, provided the primary source of repayment for the loan is not sale of,
or rental income derived from, real estate.

(6) Leases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies did not propose changes to the existing exemption for leases. Under this exemption, regulated institutions
are not required to obtain appraisals of leases that are not the economic equivalent of the purchase or sale of real
estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the agencies did not propose changes to this exemption, some commenters suggested that Title XI appraisals
should be required if a regulated institution takes any security interest in a real estate lease. The distinction
between operating leases and capital leases is well recognized in accounting practice. Consistent with the distinction
in accounting for operating and capital leases, the agencies have concluded that, in general, operating leases,
which are not equivalent to the purchase or sale of the leased property, should not require Title XI appraisals given
the limited real estate interest such leases represent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In transactions that involve capital leases (leases that are the economic equivalent of purchasing or selling real
estate), the given real estate interest is of sufficient magnitude to be counted as an asset of the lessee under accounting
practices. Generally, the agencies will continue to require regulated institutions to obtain appraisals in connection
with transactions that involve capital leases.

(7) Renewals, Refinancings, and Other Subsequent Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for renewals, refinancings, and other subsequent
transactions at the lending institution to simplify the conditions under which the exemption applies. Under the
final rule, regulated institutions will be permitted to renew or refinance existing extensions of credit without
first obtaining a Title XI appraisal for two general classes of transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, a subsequent transaction is exempt provided there has been no obvious and material change in market conditions
or physical aspects of the property that threatens the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection
after the transaction, even with the advancement of new funds. This modification to the proposed rule is intended
to emphasize that an institution must consider the effect of changes in market conditions and physical aspects of
the property on its collateral protection when it advances funds in excess of reasonable closing costs as part of a
renewal, refinancing, or other subsequent transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, a subsequent transaction is exempt provided that no new monies are advanced other than funds necessary to
cover reasonable closing costs. The proposed rule did not explicitly address this class of transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies note that this exemption would not be applicable if a borrower refinances a mortgage with a new lender.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the adoption of this amendment, the agencies did not require a Title XI appraisal for a subsequent transaction
that resulted from a maturing extension of credit if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The borrower had performed satisfactorily according to the original terms; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No new monies were advanced other than as previously agreed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The credit standing of the borrower had not deteriorated; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) There had been no obvious and material deterioration in market conditions or physical aspects of the property
which would threaten the institution's collateral protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the agencies' experience, the original exemption may not have provided sufficient flexibility to regulated institutions
and borrowers when a transaction was refinanced before its maturity. This is particularly true for refinancings
to reduce a loan's interest rate. Further, bankers questioned whether a Title XI appraisal would be required for a
refinancing where the borrower's payment history is sound and future repayment prospects are good, but the borrower's
collateral has declined in value as a result of a general market decline. The agencies believe that not requiring a
Title XI appraisal in such refinancings is consistent with safe and sound banking practices because the amount of
the loan (except for the addition of reasonable closing costs) and the lender's collateral remain the same, and the
lower loan payments may improve the ability of the borrower to repay the loan without adversely affecting the likelihood
that the lender will be repaid.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a subsequent transaction that includes the advancement of additional funds does not result in the level of collateral
protection being threatened, despite a change in the market conditions or physical aspects of the property, a Title
XI appraisal need not be obtained. For example, a loan originally extended with a low loan-to-value ratio could be
renewed and additional funds advanced above closing costs without a Title XI appraisal, even though market conditions
have deteriorated, if the regulated institution, after verifying the value of the collateral, concludes that the
new loan-to-value ratio will provide adequate protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, if a borrower is refinancing a loan where the real estate collateral is located in a market that has experienced
significant appreciation, the institution should ensure that the advancement of any new monies is based on substantiated
appreciation in value. An institution can advance funds against an appreciated property whose future use is consistent
with the use described in the original appraisal. If an institution makes a substantial advance that could possibly
threaten the institution's collateral protection, it should consider the need to obtain a new Title XI appraisal.
This exemption would not be available if a material change in the use of the property produces the reported appreciation,
such as when property is rezoned for a different use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While a Title XI appraisal is not required for transactions that qualify for this exemption, regulated institutions
are required to obtain an appropriate evaluation of the collateral in accordance with the agencies' guidelines.
The level of analysis and information included in the evaluation should be more detailed as the institution's exposure
in the transaction increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised questions about the applicability of this exemption to loan restructurings and workouts.
In such situations, the commenters contended that requiring a Title XI appraisal may impede an institution's ability
to obtain additional real estate collateral to shore-up its position or to advance new funds to protect its existing
collateral position. The agencies acknowledge that the time and cost of obtaining a Title XI appraisal may present
barriers to institutions in their negotiations with borrowers in a loan restructuring or workout. The agencies believe
that this situation has been addressed in the regulation and the agencies' guidance, such as the November 7, 1991 Interagency
Policy Statement on the Review and Classification of Commercial Real Estate Loans. It is the agencies' policy to encourage
lenders to work constructively with their borrowers when restructuring existing loans that have credible support
for repayment.

(8) Transactions Involving Real Estate Notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for transactions involving real estate-secured
loans, loan participations, pooled loans, interests in real property, and mortgage-backed securities. The amendment
clarifies when regulated institutions may engage in secondary mortgage market transactions involving real estate
loans and other interests in real estate without obtaining a new Title XI appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption adopted by the agencies clarifies and allows regulated institutions to purchase, sell, invest in,
exchange, or extend credit secured by, real estate-secured notes or interests in real estate without obtaining a
new Title XI appraisal if each note or real estate interest is supported by an appraisal that met the regulatory appraisal
requirements for the institution at the time the real estate-secured note was originated. The prior exemption referred
to purchases of these interests only. In addition, the agencies have changed the text of the final rule to more clearly
state the appraisal requirements that the underlying notes must meet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption serves federal public policy interests by helping to ensure that the appraisal regulation does not
unnecessarily inhibit secondary mortgage market transactions that involve these real estate-secured loans and
real estate interests. The exemption makes clear that a regulated institution need not obtain new Title XI appraisals
for loans originated before the effective date of the agencies' regulations in order to buy or sell them in the secondary
mortgage market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have concluded that the transactions exempted by this provision do not require new Title XI appraisals
to protect federal financial and public policy interests or the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
Principles of safe and sound banking practice require regulated institutions to determine the suitability of purchasing
or investing in existing real estate-secured loans and real estate interests. Typically, these transactions will
have a history of performance or will have been originated according to secondary mortgage market standards. The
additional information from these sources, when coupled with the original documentation, permits regulated institutions
to make appropriate decisions regarding these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that this exemption raised safety and soundness concerns because exempt transactions may
have appraisals performed before Title XI appraisal requirements went into effect. Because regulated institutions
will have other sources of information about the performance of these seasoned loans, the agencies believe that new
Title XI appraisals are not necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of these exempt transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters urged the agencies to expand the proposed exemption, or adopt new exemptions, to eliminate the Title
XI appraisal requirement for all mortgage-backed securities. In addition, commenters suggested that the agencies
exempt residential mortgage warehousing loans (loans to residential mortgage lenders who ultimately sell the mortgages
to the secondary mortgage market), transactions with credit ratings by established rating agencies, or transactions
that were not subject to the agencies' jurisdiction at origination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that to protect federal financial and public policy interests, the underlying loans or real
estate interests should have appraisals that meet the requirements that were applicable to regulated institutions
when the underlying transactions were originated. For this reason, the agencies are not adopting the suggestions
for exempting additional categories of transactions under this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters also suggested that the agencies should permit a regulated institution that purchases a pool of loans,
invests in mortgage-backed securities, or secures a mortgage warehousing loan with real estate notes, to confirm
that the loans have appropriate appraisals without reviewing the appraisal for each underlying loan. The agencies
agree that it should not be necessary to review the appraisal for each underlying loan in all cases. The agencies believe
that regulated institutions may use sampling and audit procedures to determine whether appraisals for the underlying
loans in a loan pool satisfy the regulation's requirements and to verify the seller's representations and warranties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also believe that a regulated institution may presume that the underlying loans in an investment-grade,
marketable, mortgage-backed security satisfy the requirements of the appraisal regulation whenever an issuer
makes a public statement, such as in a prospectus, that the appraisals comply with the agencies' regulations. To be
considered investment grade, a security must be rated in one of the top four rating classifications of at least one
nationally recognized statistical rating service. A marketable security is one that may be sold with reasonable
promptness at a price that corresponds to its fair value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For mortgage warehousing loans, sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac of the mortgages that secure the mortgage warehouse
loan may be used to demonstrate that the underlying loans complied with the appraisal requirements of the agencies'
regulations. The institution, however, must continue to monitor its borrower's performance in selling loans to
the secondary market and take appropriate steps, such as increased sampling and auditing of the loans and their documentation,
if the borrower experiences more than a minimal rejection rate.

(9) Transactions Insured or Guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency or U.S. Government Sponsored Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a uniform exemption for transactions that are wholly or partially insured or guaranteed
by a United States government agency or government sponsored agency because these loans pose little risk to insured
institutions. This exemption will eliminate the confusion among regulated institutions who may believe that two
separate appraisals are required_one meeting the banking agencies' regulations and another meeting the federal
loan programs' standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prior regulations of the OCC, FDIC, and OTS exempted many of these transactions. However, they previously required
that these transactions be supported by an appraisal that conformed to the requirements of the insuring or guaranteeing
agency. Prior to adoption of this amendment, the Board's appraisal regulation did not specifically exempt these
transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federally insured or guaranteed transactions must meet all the underwriting requirements of the federal insurer
or guarantor, including real estate appraisal requirements, in order to receive the insurance or guarantee. The
agencies believe that the standards of these loan programs are sufficient to protect the safety and soundness of regulated
financial institutions. Therefore, it is unnecessary to require that these transactions also meet the overlapping
requirements of the banking and thrift agencies' appraisal regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that the agencies should limit the application of this exemption to federal loan programs
with appraisal requirements that conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and
require the use of licensed or certified appraisers. In addition, commenters raised concerns that some loan programs
may not have appraisal standards and asked the agencies to list those loan programs to which this exemption applies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB has directed federal agencies with government guaranteed or insured loan programs to conduct real estate appraisal
programs in a manner to reduce default risks to the federal government. Specifically, these federal agencies are
required to ensure that all real estate credit transactions over $100,000 have an appraisal performed by a state licensed
or certified appraiser and that the appraisal be conducted under appraisal standards that are consistent with the
USPAP.

The agencies believe that the authority of OMB to ensure that federal agencies adopt appropriate real estate appraisal
standards eliminates the need to list specific loan programs for which this exemption applies. Moreover, OMB is monitoring
the implementation of those appraisal programs and has required any federal agency not having appraisal standards
and practices in place to submit an implementation plan and schedule to OMB. If the agencies later determine that a
particular federal loan program poses a threat to the safety and soundness of regulated institutions, the agencies
have retained the authority to require appraisals in such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption also applies to certain other real estate-related financial transactions involving government
agencies or government sponsored agencies. For example, the U.S. Postal Service typically contracts with a developer
to erect and lease a special purpose building for the Postal Service's use. Applicable contract procedures normally
require only cost estimates when determining who is awarded the contract. The Postal Service also enters into a lease
with the developer. The lease payments, which are assigned to the lender, are sufficient to repay the loan. Because
the developer is complying with applicable contract procedures, which require only cost estimates, it would be an
unnecessary burden for the developer or the lender to also obtain a Title XI appraisal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for transactions that meet the qualifications
for sale to any U.S. government agency or government sponsored agency. By referring to any U.S. government agency
or sponsored agency, the exemption includes not only loans sold to federal agencies, but also any transaction that
meets the qualifications for sale to agencies established or chartered by the federal government to serve public
purposes specified by the U.S. Congress. These government sponsored agencies are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Banks for Cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption permits regulated institutions to originate, hold, buy, or sell transactions that meet the qualifications
for sale to any U.S. government agency and the above listed government sponsored agencies without obtaining a separate
appraisal conforming to the agencies' regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption contains a modification to the original proposal that permits regulated institutions to accept appraisals
performed in accordance with the appraisal standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for any residential real estate
transaction, both single family and multifamily, regardless of whether the loan is eligible to be purchased by Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac. This modification clarifies that a regulated institution's ``jumbo'' or other residential real
estate loans that do not conform to all the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, but that are supported
by an appraisal that meets the appraisal standards of these agencies, will qualify for this exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption expands the prior exception to the regulations of the OCC, FDIC, and OTS for transactions involving
1-to-4 family residential properties that had appraisals conforming to the appraisal standards of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. In addition, the OTS exception applied to existing multifamily properties. These transactions were
not required to comply with the additional supervisory standards set forth in the prior regulations. The Board did
not have a similar exception in its prior regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the agencies continue the prior exception allowing the use of Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac standards for any loans involving 1-to-4 family residential real estate. Other commenters stated that the proposed
exemption should not be adopted because the agencies would not be meeting their statutory obligation to set appraisal
standards for transactions within their jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe the appraisal standards of the U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies established
to maintain a secondary market in various types of loans are appropriate for these exempt transactions. Recently,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac revised their 1-to-4 family residential appraisal standards and report forms to incorporate
the USPAP as the minimum appraisal standards. Further, the appraisal standards and forms of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac are recognized as the appraisal industry's standard for residential real estate appraisals. The agencies have
concluded that those appraisal standards should protect federal financial and public policy interests in the loans
that are eligible for purchase by U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies. The agencies also believe that
compliance with these standards will protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that permitting regulated institutions to follow these standardized appraisal requirements,
without the necessity of obtaining a separate appraisal or an appraisal supplement for conformance with the banking
agencies' regulations, will reduce regulatory burden and increase an institution's ability to buy and sell these
types of loans, improving the institution's liquidity.

(11) Transactions by Regulated Institutions as Fiduciaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a new exemption for transactions in which a regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary
capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other law. The amendment clarifies that regulated institutions
acting as fiduciaries are not required to obtain appraisals under the agencies' appraisal regulations if no appraisal
is required under other law governing their fiduciary responsibilities in connection with those transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to adoption of this amendment, it was unclear whether the agencies' appraisal regulations required appraisals
for all real estate-related financial transactions in which regulated institutions participated as fiduciaries.
For example, other law may not require an appraisal in connection with the sale of a parcel of real estate to a beneficiary
of a trust on terms specified in the trust instrument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While financial institutions were in general agreement with the proposed exemption, some of these commenters stated
that a fiduciary should be exempt from meeting Title XI appraisal requirements regardless of whether other laws require
an appraisal. Commenters opposing this exemption believe that fiduciaries should be required to obtain a Title XI
appraisal for all their real estate-related transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have concluded that a Title XI appraisal should not be required when regulated institutions engage in
real estate-related financial transactions as fiduciaries and no other law (including state common law establishing
the responsibilities of fiduciaries) requires appraisals for those transactions. Losses as a result of these transactions
would not, absent some negligence by the institution, be incurred by the institution. Therefore, exempting these
transactions from the Title XI appraisal requirement should not adversely affect the safety and soundness of financial
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a fiduciary transaction requires an appraisal under other law, that appraisal should conform to the requirements
of the agencies' regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision was added to the rule to make clear that the agencies retain the authority to determine in a given case
when the services of an appraiser are not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only a few commenters addressed this issue. One commenter expressed the concern that the agencies are granting themselves
the authority to create new exemptions without the benefit of public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have the authority to implement and interpret regulations under their jurisdiction. The specific exemptions
of the regulation describe the major categories of transactions that would not require appraisals. As a result of
their experience in implementing their regulations, however, the agencies recognized that it is impossible to identify
all types of transactions for which the services of an appraiser should not be required under Title XI of FIRREA and
proposed this exemption to confirm their authority to determine that individual transactions do not require the
services of an appraiser. The agencies will adopt any new exemptions covering broad categories of transactions in
accordance with notice and comment rulemaking procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed amendment concerning evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule requires regulated institutions to obtain evaluations for real estate-related financial transactions
that do not require Title XI appraisals because they: (i) Are below the threshold level; (ii) qualify for the exemption
for business loans of $1 million or less where income from real estate is not the primary source of repayment; or (iii)
qualify for the exemption for subsequent transactions resulting from an existing extension of credit. The agencies
changed the text of this amendment to make clear that institutions must still obtain evaluations for these exempt
transactions. The regulation does not require the institution to have an evaluation if the transaction qualifies
for an exemption other than these three exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An evaluation provides a general estimate of the value of real estate and need not meet the detailed requirements of
a Title XI appraisal. An evaluation must provide appropriate information to enable the institution to make a prudent
decision regarding the transaction. Because institutions must tailor evaluations to provide appropriate information
for different types of transactions, the content and form of evaluations will vary for different transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their prior regulations, the OCC, Board and OTS required evaluations for all real estate-related financial transactions
that do not require appraisals. The FDIC's prior regulation stated that supervisory guidelines, general banking
practices or other prudent standards may require an appropriate valuation of real property collateral when a Title
XI appraisal is not required. For some institutions, the effect of these provisions may have been to require evaluations
in cases where they did not assist in protecting the institutions' safety and soundness. The agencies are amending
their regulations to require regulated institutions to have evaluations only for those real estate-related financial
transactions where an understanding of the real estate's value is generally needed to assist the institution in deciding
whether to enter into the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that evaluations should not be required for any exempt transactions and that the decision
to obtain an evaluation should be left to the institution. Commenters suggested that the agencies should require
appraisals for any transaction that requires an evaluation and raised questions about the qualifications and independence
of persons performing evaluations. Some commenters stated that only licensed or certified appraisers were qualified
to perform evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that safety and soundness principles require institutions to obtain an understanding of, and
document, the value of the real estate involved in transactions that: (i) Are below the threshold level; (ii) qualify
for the exemption for business loans of $1 million or less where income from real estate is not the primary source of
repayment; or (iii) involve an existing extension of credit. In these cases, while a Title XI appraisal is not required
to determine the value of the real estate, the agencies have concluded that regulated institutions must have an estimate
of the real estate's value as a matter of safe and sound banking practice. For this reason, the agencies have decided
that institutions should not have the discretion to decide whether they will obtain evaluations for these transactions.
However, institutions will have discretion, within the limits of safe and sound banking practice as indicated in
agency guidance, to determine the content and form of the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While licensed or certified appraisers may be qualified to perform evaluations, the agencies do not believe these
appraisers are the only persons that can render a competent estimate of the value of real estate for exempt transactions.
Requiring institutions to procure the services of a licensed or certified appraiser to prepare evaluations or Title
XI appraisals for exempt transactions could impose significant additional costs on lenders and borrowers without
significantly increasing the safety and soundness of the transactions. However, the agencies' regulations do not,
as suggested by some commenters, prohibit regulated institutions from using licensed or certified appraisers to
prepare evaluations. Nor do the regulations prevent regulated institutions from obtaining Title XI appraisals
for exempt transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also believe that regulated institutions can take steps to ensure that the individuals performing evaluations
are capable of providing an unbiased estimate of value. Institutions would generally be expected to check that persons
who prepare evaluations are subject to adequate safeguards and controls to assure the integrity of the evaluation
they perform. The agencies intend that regulated institutions have some flexibility in the safeguards they erect
to ensure the independence of the person performing the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies' experience with transactions exempt under their prior appraisal requirements indicates that employees
of a regulated institution generally can provide an unbiased and competent evaluation of real estate collateral
for exempt transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are deficiencies in an individual institution's evaluation procedures, including its procedures for determining
whether to order Title XI appraisals for exempt transactions, the agencies can take appropriate steps to have the
institution correct the problem. This can include requiring the institution to obtain appraisals for exempt transactions
to address safety and soundness problems.

.3(c)&blank;Appraisals To Address Safety and Soundness Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting substantially as proposed an amendment stating that each agency continues to reserve the
right to require a regulated institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal whenever the agency believes that an appraisal
is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. This authority may involve the agency requiring an institution
to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit or an entire group of credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised the concern that the agencies' authority to require a Title XI appraisal for safety and soundness
purposes should be exercised only on a prospective basis. Further, several commenters noted that the agencies' authority
to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an appraisal is required may lead to inconsistencies among the agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether an institution will be required, pursuant to this provision or existing safety and soundness authority,
to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit, or an entire group of credits, may depend on the condition
of that institution. If an institution is in troubled condition, and that troubled condition is attributable to underwriting
problems in the institution's real estate loan portfolio, then the agencies may require such an institution to obtain
an appraisal for all new real estate-related financial transactions below the threshold that are not subject to another
exemption. Thus, for example, a troubled institution whose problems are attributable to trading losses, investment
losses, or a defalcation might be allowed to continue to operate under the $250,000 threshold, whereas an institution
whose problems are attributable to poor underwriting of real estate loans may be subjected to a lower threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, regardless of an institution's condition, an examiner may determine that a particular real estate-related
financial transaction requires a Title XI appraisal. This provision confirms that the agencies have the authority
to require appraisals for a particular transaction to address safety and soundness concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination that a particular institution will have to obtain appraisals below the threshold will be made by the
appropriate agency's supervisory office. Although this provision is intended to be applied on a case-by-case basis
to address the problems of a particular institution, the agencies will work to maintain consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated in the discussion of the appraisal threshold, as a matter of policy, OTS intends to require problem
institutions or institutions in troubled condition to continue to obtain Title XI appraisals for loans over $100,000.
Given the overall concentration of real estate-related transactions in the thrift industry, OTS believes that a
problem thrift or a thrift in troubled condition will, in general, have real estate-related asset quality problems.

.4(a)&blank;Minimum Appraisal Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting five minimum appraisal standards in place of the 14 standards in the prior rule. The final
rule includes four modifications to the proposed rule concerning minimum appraisal standards. The final rule requires
all appraisals for federally related transactions to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the USPAP unless principles of safe and sound
banking require compliance with stricter standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Be written and contain sufficient information and analysis to support the institution's decision to engage
in the transaction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Analyze and report appropriate deductions and discounts for proposed construction or renovation, partially
leased buildings, non-market lease terms, and tract developments with unsold units; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Be based upon the definition of market value as set forth in the regulation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Be performed by State licensed or certified appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of these standards will simplify compliance with the appraisal regulation without affecting the usefulness
of the Title XI appraisals prepared for federally related transactions. The amendment allows institutions to make
use of the USPAP Departure Provision and eliminates several regulatory standards that parallel existing USPAP standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies proposed three alternatives for meeting the statutory requirement to use the USPAP in setting minimum
appraisal standards for federally related transactions. Under the first two alternatives, the agencies would have
published the USPAP as part of their regulations (either as an appendix to their rules or through incorporation by
reference). The agencies have chosen to adopt the third alternative that generally references USPAP, but does not
make USPAP a part of the agencies' regulations. The agencies agree with many commenters who believed that Alternative
III was the most workable approach because the agencies would not have to republish changes to the USPAP adopted by
the Appraisal Standards Board, and references to USPAP in the regulation could be assumed to always refer to the most
current USPAP edition. The agencies believe that Alternative III minimizes potential conflicts between an institution's
duty to follow the agencies' appraisal requirements and an appraiser's professional obligation to follow the latest
USPAP version. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the agencies are adopting Alternative III, USPAP provisions applicable to federally related transactions
will no longer be published as Appendix A to the agencies' appraisal regulations. Therefore, each agency has deleted
Appendix A from its appraisal regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because application of present or future USPAP standards to federally related transactions may be inconsistent
with maintaining the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the agencies have modified the standard on
compliance with the USPAP. This modification makes clear that principles of safe and sound banking may require institutions
to comply with stricter standards than the USPAP. Although the institution has the primary responsibility for obtaining
a Title XI appraisal that meets its needs, the agencies may by regulation or guidance identify USPAP standards that
are inappropriate for federally related transactions. For example, the USPAP allows an appraiser to appraise property
even though the appraiser may have a direct or indirect interest in the property, if the appraiser discloses this fact
in the appraisal report. The agencies believe, however, that federal financial and public policy interests are better
served by requiring that an appraiser for a federally related transaction not have any direct or indirect interest,
financial or otherwise, in the transaction or the property. The agencies have included this requirement in the section
of the regulation that deals with appraiser independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum standards also permit regulated institutions to use appraisals prepared in accordance with the USPAP
Departure Provision for federally related transactions. The Departure Provision permits limited exceptions to
specific guidelines in the USPAP. Appraisers preparing appraisals using the Departure Provision still must comply
with all binding requirements of the USPAP and must be sure that the resulting appraisal will not be misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that regulated institutions should be allowed to determine, with the assistance of the appraiser,
whether an appraisal to be prepared in accordance with the Departure Provision is appropriate for a particular transaction
and consistent with principles of safe and sound banking practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed standard that requires appraisals for federally related
transactions to be written. The modification makes clear that the written appraisal must contain sufficient information
and analysis to support the institution's decision to engage in the transaction. The modification puts regulated
institutions on notice of their responsibility to have appraisals that are appropriate for the particular federally
related transaction. The agencies are aware that the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation has proposed
changing the USPAP to expand the types of appraisal reports that appraisers may prepare. The agencies believe that
the standard on written appraisals permits regulated institutions to take advantage of additional flexibility
that may be available if the USPAP is amended, as long as the appraisal report contains information and analysis to
support the institution's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are retaining from the prior rule the standard regarding deductions and discounts. The USPAP provision
on this subject requires the appraiser to include a discussion of deductions and discounts only when it is necessary
to prevent an appraisal from being misleading. Although commenters were divided over the need to retain this regulatory
standard, the agencies have decided that it is appropriate to emphasize the need to include an appropriate discussion
of deductions and discounts applicable to the estimate of value in Title XI appraisals for federally related transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in order to properly underwrite a loan, a regulated institution may need to know a prospective value of
a property, in addition to the market value as of the date of the appraisal. A prospective value of a property is based
upon events yet to occur, such as completion of construction or renovation, reaching a stabilized occupancy level,
or some other event to be determined. Thus, more than one value may be reported in an appraisal, as long as all values
are clearly described and reflect the projected dates when future events could occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard on deductions and discounts is intended to make clear that appraisers must analyze, apply, and report
appropriate discounts and deductions when providing values based on future events. In financing the purchase of
an existing home, there typically would be no need to apply any discounts or deductions to arrive at the market value
of the property since the institution's financing of the project does not depend on events such as further development
of the property or the sale of units in a tract development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In place of the proposed standard on market value, the agencies are retaining the prior standard that required the
appraisal to be based on the definition of market value contained in the agencies' rules. Use of the standard from the
prior rule is intended to emphasize that the agencies are not changing the definition of market value or the manner
in which that definition is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are eliminating regulatory standards that parallel or duplicate requirements of the USPAP. The regulatory
standards originally were put in place because of uncertainty about the content of the USPAP and its interpretation.
Based on their experience with the USPAP, the agencies believe that the additional standards may be eliminated. Commenters
generally agreed. The majority of commenters responded to three specific questions on the need for additional regulatory
standards by indicating that it was unnecessary to adopt separate standards on: (i) Analysis of revenues, expenses
and vacancies; (ii) valuation of personal property; and (iii) reconciliation of the three approaches to value. The
elimination of regulatory standards that parallel USPAP standards should simplify the preparation of appraisals
for federally related transactions and reduce regulatory burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the agencies are adding a new provision to make clear that all appraisals for federally related transactions
must be prepared by licensed or certified appraisers. This requirement is mandated by Title XI of FIRREA and repeated
in other parts of the appraisal regulation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are removing the provision that required appraisers to disclose and explain when information necessary
to the completion of an appraisal is unavailable. The USPAP currently requires appraisers to disclose and explain
the absence of information necessary to completion of an appraisal that is not misleading. See USPAP Standard Rule
2&hyph;2(k). Moreover, when information that may materially affect the estimate of value is unavailable, the agencies
believe that generally accepted appraisal standards require appraisers to explain the absence of that information
and its effect on the reliability of the appraisal. Therefore, eliminating this provision does not result in a substantive
change in the requirements applicable to appraisals for federally related transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are removing a provision that merely confirmed the authority of regulated institutions to require appraisers
they use to comply with additional standards. The regulation's minimum appraisal standards for federally related
transactions do not prevent a regulated institution from requiring an appraiser to follow additional standards
or provide additional information to satisfy the institution's business needs and it is unnecessary to restate this
fact in the appraisal regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting the proposed amendment concerning the use of appraisals prepared for financial services
institutions other than institutions subject to Title XI of FIRREA. The agencies' prior appraisal regulations provided
that fee appraisers must be engaged by the regulated institution or its agent. An exception to this requirement was
permitted if the appraiser was directly engaged by another institution that is subject to Title XI of FIRREA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies concluded that the prior provision on the use of appraisals prepared for other institutions was too restrictive.
It required a regulated institution to obtain a new appraisal if the borrower originally sought a loan from an institution
that was not subject to Title XI of FIRREA and was not an agent of that regulated institution. There also was uncertainty
about the meaning of agent in these cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended provision permits a regulated institution to use an appraisal that was prepared for any financial services
institution, including mortgage bankers, if certain conditions are met. The appraiser must be engaged directly
by the financial services institution and must not have a direct interest, financial or otherwise, in the property
or the transaction. In addition, the regulated institution must ensure that the appraisal conforms to the requirements
of the regulation and is otherwise acceptable. The prohibition on the institution using an appraisal prepared for
the borrower remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments concerning this provision favored the proposed change. One commenter requested that the
agencies define financial services institutions and include mortgage brokers within that definition. Other commenters
requested clarification of the circumstances under which a non-regulated institution can be an agent of a regulated
institution and whether agents are prohibited from receiving a commission on each transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have decided not to adopt a specific definition of financial services institution. This term is intended
to describe entities that provide services in connection with real estate lending transactions on an ongoing basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies do not intend to limit the arrangements that regulated institutions have with their agents, provided
those arrangements do not place the agent in a conflict of interest that prevents the agent from representing the interests
of the regulated institution. For example, the agencies do not require that there be a written agreement between the
regulated institution and the agent, and the agent may represent the regulated institution solely with respect to
ordering appraisals. In addition, the agencies' regulations do not prohibit agents from receiving a commission
for transactions on which they order appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters opposed the amendment because of their concern that it would increase the pressure on appraisers
to render an estimate of value that favors the interests of the borrower. However, regulated institutions are not
required to accept appraisals that are prepared for other financial services institutions. Therefore, the institution
always retains complete control over the process of ordering real estate appraisals. In addition, institutions
must determine that the appraisal ordered by the financial services institution complies with the requirements
of the agencies' regulations and is otherwise acceptable. This should include obtaining assurance that the financial
services institution has an independent appraisal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other suggested changes to reduce the burden on secondary market transactions involving real estate notes, particularly
for mortgage warehousing loans, are addressed in the exemption for transactions in real estate notes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The transaction is not secured by real estate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A lien on real estate has been taken for purposes other than the real estate's value; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) The transaction is a business loan that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has a transaction value of $1 million or less; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate as the primary source of repayment;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased
real estate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The transaction involves an existing extension of credit at the lending institution, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens
the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction, even with the advancement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

loan or interest in a loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgaged-backed securities,
and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or real property interest met FDIC regulatory requirements for appraisals
at the time of origination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or United States
government sponsored agency;

(i) Qualifies for sale to a United States government agency or United States government sponsored agency; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage
Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to that category of real estate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other
law; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The FDIC determines that the services of an appraiser are not necessary in order to protect Federal financial

of the institution.

(5) The transaction is a business loan that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has a transaction value of $1 million or less; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate as the primary source of repayment;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased
real estate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

at the time of origination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or United States
government sponsored agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage
Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to that category of real estate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other
law; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Single Family Property Disposition program (24 CFR part 291), which disposes of one-to-four family properties
acquired by HUD or otherwise held by HUD, includes an initiative by the Department for the lease and sale of properties
to governmental entities, tribes, and private nonprofit organizations for use by homeless persons (subpart E of
part 291). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations, applicants that have been preapproved by HUD are notified of the availability of properties
for a 10-day consideration and inspection period before the properties are offered for sale to the general public.
(See 24 CFR 291.410(d).) Properties are leased or sold to applicants on a first come-first served basis. No more than
10 percent of the total inventory, as of October 1, may be leased under the program; there is no limitation on the sale
of properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may purchase properties, at a discount, either through a direct sale or by submitting a competitive bid.
Applicants that choose to lease properties may purchase them at any time during the leasehold. Leases are for a one-year
term, renewable for up to four additional one-year terms, for $1 a year. Lessees are responsible for all utilities,
taxes, and other costs associated with operating the property. Under 24 CFR 291.415(d), lessees are required to establish
an escrow account, with HUD as a co-signer, and make monthly deposits to the account in an amount sufficient to reimburse
HUD for any taxes on the property.

II. Amendments by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1407 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved Oct. 28, 1992; hereafter
referred to as ``1992 HCD Act'') directs the Secretary to make several amendments to this discretionary program.
Subsection 1407(a) prohibits the Secretary from making a property available for lease under the homeless initiative
program unless the property has first been listed and made generally available for sale to the public for at least 30
days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act provides an exception to subsection 1407(a) with respect to any area in which
the Secretary determines that there will not be a sufficient quantity of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing
available for use under the program if properties located in the area are first made generally available to the public.
In such exception cases, the Secretary will make available to preapproved applicants up to 10 percent of the total
number of properties in the HUD inventory for the area before offering those properties to the general public. The
Secretary is also directed to consult with the unit of general local government for the area in determining which properties
should be reserved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 HCD Act, in subsection 1407(c), also directs the Secretary to identify and describe, upon request by an applicant
or lessee, any exemptions or reductions related to the payment of property taxes under State or local laws that may
be applicable to lessees or to the leased properties. Finally, subsection 1407(c) of the 1992 HCD Act also provides
that the Secretary may not require the lessee to make deposits for the payment of taxes into an escrow account, where
such an exemption or reduction is provided.

On August 11, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 42707) which would implement the changes required
by section 1407 of the 1992 HCD Act, as well as some additional conforming changes. This final rule implements those
proposed changes as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
30-day Marketing Period and Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with subsection 1407(a), this final rule amends 24 CFR 291.400(c) to reflect the statutory requirement
that HUD make property available for sale to the general public for at least 30 days before HUD makes the property available
for lease under the program. In addition, this final rule also requires that the property be vacant, and not under contract
or committed to another program for availability under the lease program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also adds conforming changes to &sect;291.410(d) regarding notification to applicants of available
properties. After the public sale period, the HUD Field Office will notify applicants of eligible properties available
in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by them. Specific properties selected by an applicant will be held off
the market for a 10-day consideration and inspection period, which will begin to run upon written notification by
the applicant to the Field Office. (The Department encourages applicants to notify Field Offices by Facsimile (FAX).)
Only those properties in which an applicant has submitted a written expression of interest will be held off the market.
If no further communication from the applicant is received by the end of the 10-day consideration and inspection period,
the Field Office will resume offering the properties for sale to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act, the final rule provides an exception to the 30-day listing for
general sale in Field Offices having 200, or fewer, total properties in inventory as of October 1 of each year. HUD has
determined that these offices are less likely to have properties available for applicants after 30 days on the market.
HUD will select these ``exception'' field offices based upon the number of properties held in inventory as of October
1, of each year (initially October 1, 1993), the number of properties the Department anticipates acquiring over the
ensuing 12-month period and the speed with which such properties are selling. In ``exception'' Field Offices, if
homeless providers have requested to lease properties, properties will be offered to them for a 10-day consideration
and inspection period before the properties are listed for sale to the general public. Field Offices subject to this
exception will notify applicants of properties in designated ZIP Code areas prior to public listing until such time
as 10 percent of their total inventory, as of October 1, has been leased. The Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal
Housing Commissioner will supply a list of the exception Field Offices to the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning
and Development and all field offices on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also provides that, in those Field Offices subject to the exception, HUD will consult with units of general
local government to identify areas where there is a need for units for homeless persons and will make this information
available to applicants. However, local governments will not have veto-power over where properties used by the homeless
are located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Exception From or Reduction of State and Local Property Taxes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also amends 24 CFR 291.415(d) to describe HUD's duty under subsection 1407(c) of the 1992 HCD Act to provide
information to applicants or lessees regarding any exemption from or reduction of property taxes under State and
local laws. Under this final rule, where State or local law grants such an exemption or reduction, HUD will not require
that the applicant establish an escrow account for that portion of the payment of property taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the amendment necessitated by subsection 1407(c) is included in the final rule, the Department previously
determined that this provision is effective as of October 28, 1992, the date of enactment of the 1992 HCD Act. HUD Field
Offices were instructed to provide this information upon the request of an applicant or lessee.

Miscellaneous Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule also amends part 291 to reflect changes to the Department's Supportive Housing program. The 1992 HCD
Act terminated the Supportive Housing Demonstration (formerly implemented in 24 CFR parts 577 and 578), and replaced
it with a new Supportive Housing program. An interim rule for that program was published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13870),
and is codified at 24 CFR part 583.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department has made several changes to the proposed rule in this final rule. Those changes are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. This final rule requires that applicants submit a certification of compliance with fair housing laws, as well as
other nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, as part of the preapproval process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. In &sect;291.410(d), the references to a 45-day period have been changed to 30-day period. The 45-day reference
was inadvertently put in the proposed rule, and this change reflects a technical correction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
C. In &sect;291.410(d), and with regard to re-offering a property to an applicant, the rule is changed to provide that
an unsold property will be re-offered to an applicant if no offer from the public has been 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Section 291.410(d) is further modified to show that written notification of interest in a particular property
by the applicant may be sent via facsimile, and the Department encourages applicants to use this method of notification.
Signed leases may also be transmitted in this manner, followed by submission of the original. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Section 291.410(e) has been deleted from the final rule. The Department believes that this provision was redundant
since &sect;291.110, as published on October 20, 1993, in an interim rule amending the Single Family Property Disposition
program, sets forth the same notification procedures. In the interest of simplification and readability, the Department
has removed this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;291.425 have been changed to indicate that the sales price of any HUD-owned property
acquired under this program will be discounted in an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary, but not less
than 10 percent. This change will make the rule governing the homeless initiative consistent with an amendment to
&sect;291.110(a) in the October 20, 1993 interim rule for the Single Family Property Disposition program.

IV. Discussion of Public Comments From Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 38 public comments in response to the proposed rule published on August 11, 1993. The following
discussion summarizes the comments and provides HUD's responses to those comments. Every comment was reviewed and
considered, although it may not be specifically addressed in this preamble.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received twenty-one comments objecting to the regulatory change which requires that HUD offer properties
for sale to the public for 30 days prior to making them available for leasing to homeless providers. These commenters
were generally concerned that only the least desirable properties would remain in the inventory after the 30-day
public listing period for a variety of reasons: (a) The increased costs associated with repairing the least desirable
properties; (b) the unsuitability of leasing remainder properties because of problems with accessibility to supportive
services; and (c) the location of remainder properties often being in crime ridden areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1407(a) of the 1992 HCD Act requires that HUD first offer properties to the general public for at least 30 days
before HUD makes such properties available for leasing to homeless providers. However, HUD believes that homeless
providers will have a sufficient number of acceptable properties available for their programs in most housing markets
when the 30 day marketing priority takes effect. This belief is based upon the number of single family properties currently
in the Department's inventory and the number of new acquisitions projected throughout any given year. In addition,
the Department will administer the exception provision of the law with attention to valid concerns of the participating
homeless providers, and if in general a sufficient number of acceptable properties are not available to applicants
after the public listing period, the Department will revisit the exception provision in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters objected to the 200-unit exception to the 30-day public listing period requirement. One commenter
suggested that exceptions be determined based upon the current level of usage of the homeless leasing program in an
area, and input from each field office as to where and whether the exception should apply. One commenter recommended
that the exception to the 30-day public listing period should apply whenever the inventory in a field office is less
than 500 units. One commenter recommended that the Community Planning and Development Division in each field office
work with Property Disposition staff to determine whether the exception to the 30-day listing period requirement
should apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 200 property threshold, which will determine what field offices must offer their inventory to homeless providers
on a priority basis, is based on HUD's experience administering the Homeless Initiative Program nationwide. The
Department believes this is a reasonable benchmark which will ensure adequate property availability for homeless
providers; however, if future program experience demonstrates a need for modification of this criterion to determine
exception areas, the Department will respond appropriately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1407(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 requires that HUD consult with units of local
government in determining the area in which properties should be reserved for disposition under the exception to
the 30-day public listing period. Several commenters recommended that HUD give local governments more input into
the program. Eight commenters objected to HUD's exclusion of local communities from reviewing and approving of properties
for the homeless on a case-by-case basis. Eight commenters suggested that HUD require that the program be consistent
with the local CHAS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has no control over which properties enter its inventory or where they will be located; therefore, there is no guarantee
of property availability in areas designated by the locality for providing services to the homeless. However, in
areas subject to section 1407(b), HUD will consult with local officials on an annual basis to determine which neighborhoods
are targeted by the locality for provision of adequate supportive services necessary to conduct homeless programs.
This consultation will be carried out in a manner to minimize any delay in making HUD owned properties available to
homeless providers. While the language in section 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act provides for consultation on ``which
properties should be reserved,'' HUD believes that Congress intended that the Department seek input from local governments
on the specific geographic areas in these communities where the homeless population could best be served rather than
seeking input on a property-by-property basis. Such a process would be administratively burdensome for both HUD
and the unit of local government. HUD will make every effort to work with local governments and applicants; however,
the decision on which properties are available is ultimately determined by the location of properties coming into
inventory.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters objected to the exclusive use of ZIP codes in &sect;291.410 for identifying areas of interest
by homeless providers for leasing properties, and notifying the providers of available properties since many communities
share the same ZIP codes, but not the same housing patterns. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Property listings must be based upon some generally recognized geographic designation that is part of HUD's existing
data base. The Department currently tracks its property acquisitions by ZIP code. Moreover, the Department is not
aware of a better method for tracking and identifying properties. Finally, the Department has not experienced any
difficulties using this approach in the past, nor has it had any complaints regarding this method from program participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters objected to the absence of fair housing requirements in the rule. These commenters recommended
that HUD require that the homeless providers submit a fair housing action plan and an affirmative marketing plan.
One commenter suggested that the Department require that homeless providers submit a certification of compliance
with fair housing laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since the Department cannot control which properties or what geographic areas are represented in its inventory,
a requirement that participating agencies submit a fair housing action plan and an affirmative marketing plan is
not appropriate. However, the Department requires that all of its programs be administered in a non-discriminatory
manner, and &sect;291.435 expressly makes applicants subject to the Fair Housing Act, as well as other nondiscrimination
and equal opportunity requirements. The Department agrees that applicants should submit a certification of compliance
with applicable fair housing laws. Accordingly, this final rule amends &sect;291.410(c) to require that applicants
submit a certification of compliance with fair housing laws, as well as other nondiscrimination and equal opportunity
requirements, as part of the preapproval process.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that HUD give local municipalities an opportunity to purchase homes on a more competitive

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that the current pricing structure is appropriate. HUD offers to public agencies and nonprofits
wishing to purchase a HUD-owned property the following discounts: a 10 percent discount off the list price on single
purchases, a 15 percent discount off the list price on the purchase of five or more properties, and a 30 percent discount
off the list price for properties located in certain designated ``revitalization areas.''

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that HUD change the leasing program to place a greater emphasis on supportive services,
and require that providers set up a reserve account for participants to assist the participants in moving toward independence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that it is important to place a greater emphasis on the availability of appropriate supportive
services in order to maximize the long term benefits of the Homeless Initiative program; however, requiring that
homeless providers establish reserve accounts to help move tenants towards independence seems overly burdensome
to homeless providers participating in the program at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 291.400(f) currently provides that, to the extent practical and possible, HUD will avoid excessive concentration
in a single neighborhood of properties leased or sold under this program. Although the Department did not propose
to change this provision in the proposed rule, a number of commenters recommended that the Department define ``excessive
concentration'' in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department previously addressed this issue in the final rule published September 16, 1991, where we stated that
``HUD believes that the need to avoid excessive concentration in a single neighborhood is important to the goal of
integrating former homeless persons into the community. However, rigid standards *&blank;*&blank;* would be counterproductive,
and do not recognize the diversity of communities and needs. The need for flexibility outweighs the need to establish
strict standards to ease delivery of supportive services.'' Based upon past experience in this program, the Department
continues to believe that a rigid definition would be counterproductive. Accordingly, the rule is unchanged on this
issue. However, if in the future, this proves to be a problem, the Department will revisit the issue at that time.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter objected to the single family property disposition homeless initiative program in general, arguing
that it is incompatible with local municipal housing patterns, and that leasing PD properties to homeless providers
causes declining property values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no evidence that leasing PD properties to homeless providers has caused values to decline. However, in most
housing markets, HUD properties will now be offered first to the general public before being made available for lease
to homeless providers. This should enhance homeownership opportunities, as well as provide greater stability in
residential neighborhoods.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters supported the proposal that HUD limit the number of properties held off market for any applicant
at any one time based upon the applicant's financial capacity and past performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD believes that the number of properties held off the market for an applicant should relate to that applicant's prior
housing experience and demonstrated capacity to administer the program. Field offices currently have the discretion
to determine the appropriate number of properties for any applicant.

HUD's response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 2, 1993 (58 FR 58560), the FHA Commissioner redelegated to field offices the authority to waive handbooks,
notices, directives and other issuances for Housing programs unless a regulatory or statutory provision is involved.
As a result of this redelegation of authority, field offices now have more flexibility in program administration
of the single family property disposition homeless initiative program.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters recommended that HUD change the way it administers the ten percent cap on leasing property to homeless
providers. These commenters believe that leased properties are counted toward the annual ten percent cap each time
their annual lease is renewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Properties leased to homeless providers are counted only once against the ten percent of annual inventory cap. Renewal
of a lease does not mean that an individual property is counted twice in one year towards the limitation on the number
of properties which may be leased for this purpose. Moreover, in the past, the Department as a whole has never leased
ten percent of the nationwide inventory to homeless providers, so that individual field offices exceeding their
own ten percent threshold may request reallocation of authority to lease from other areas.

 (1) HUD will make available up to 10 percent of its total inventory of properties as of October 1, 1993. Thereafter,
on October 1 of each year, the 10 percent figure will be adjusted upward or downward to reflect increases or decreases
in the total inventory. Property will be available for lease under the terms and conditions described in &sect;291.415,
in accordance with the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The property has been listed for sale for at least 30 days, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A sales contract has not been accepted for the property, or the property has not been committed to another program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where a Field Office has 200, or fewer, total properties in inventory on October 1 of each year, and where applicants
have requested to lease properties in certain designated areas, such properties will be offered first to applicants
for lease before being listed for sale to the general public until 10 percent of the total inventory of the Field Office
has been leased. HUD will also take into consideration the number of properties that the Department anticipates acquiring
over the next 12-month period and the speed with which acquired properties are selling in the area. HUD will consult,
on an annual basis, with units of general local government in the area on parts of the area where there is a need for housing
for homeless persons.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification of eligible properties available for lease.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Applicants, preapproved by HUD as described in paragraph (a) of this section, must designate geographic areas
of interest by ZIP Code to the appropriate HUD Field Office(s), and must indicate their intention to lease properties
in those areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Upon request, and after properties have been listed for sale to the general public for at least 30 days, except
as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, Field Offices will notify applicants, in writing, of available
eligible properties in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by the applicant. Specific properties selected
by the applicant will be held off the market for a 10-day consideration and inspection period beginning to run upon
notification by the applicant to the Field Office. (Where notification is by mail, the 10-day period will begin to
run five days after mailing.) Only those properties in which the applicant has expressed an interest will be held off
the market. If a signed lease is not received from the applicant by the end of the 10-day consideration and inspection
period, the Field Office will resume offering the properties for sale. (Facsimile (FAX) transmissions are acceptable.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where properties are made available to applicants before being listed for sale to the public, as described in
&sect;291.400(c)(2), upon request, Field Offices will notify applicants, in writing, when eligible properties
become available in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by the applicant. Those properties will remain available
for a 10-day consideration and inspection period before being listed for sale to the public. The 10-day period will
begin to run upon notification of the applicant by the Field Office. (Where notification is by mail, the consideration
period will begin to run five days after mailing.) Applicants must submit a signed lease to the Field Office by the end
of the 10-day period. (Facsimile (FAX) transmissions are acceptable.) If a signed lease is not received by the end
of the 10-day period, the Field Office will offer the properties for sale to the general public. After the initial 10-day
consideration and inspection period, a property will not be available to applicants for lease again until it has been
offered to the public for 30 days. If an applicant expresses an interest in leasing a property during or after the 30-day
public sale period, the Field Office will offer the property to the applicant for 10 days after the public sale period,
provided the property is unsold, no offer from the public has been accepted, and the property is not in a public bid-offering
period or committed to another purpose or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In notifying applicants of available properties, Field Offices will coordinate the dissemination of the information
to ensure that where more than one applicant designates a specific area, those applicants receive the list of properties
at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the applicants. Properties will be leased or sold to
applicants on a first come-first served basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for an applicant at any one time, based upon the applicant's
financial capacity and past performance as determined by HUD from information provided in the preapproval process
and observations made during monitoring of a program in progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule amends Executive Office for Immigration Review regulations concerning motion and appeal practice
in immigration proceedings. The rule is being promulgated to implement the directives of section 545 of the Immigration
Act of 1990 (``IMMACT''). Both time and number limitations on motions to reopen proceedings or to reconsider decisions
have been proposed in accordance with section 545(d) of IMMACT, and will reflect the intent of Congress to streamline
the deportation proceedings of aliens in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 545 of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649 (8 U.S.C. 1252b), modifies both substantive and
procedural aspects of motion and appeal practice in immigration proceedings. Under the proposed rule, a party may
file only one motion to reopen proceedings, and one motion to reconsider a decision of an Immigration Judge, the Board
of Immigration Appeals (``Board''), or a Service Officer. A motion to reopen proceedings must be filed within 20 days
of the final administrative decision or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later.
A motion to reconsider a decision must also be filed within 20 days of the decision or within 20 days of the effective
date of the final rule, whichever is later. Under the proposed rule, provisions concerning motions to reopen or reconsider
have been condensed into one section under 8 CFR 3.2. A new &sect;3.8 will concern fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has previously addressed issues relating to the effect of an alien's loss of lawful permanent resident status
on a motion to reopen proceedings to apply for or to further pursue an application for relief under section 212(c) of
the Act. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1982). These decisions have recently been the subject of litigation and conflicting court rulings.
Subject to all of the other requirements pertaining to motions to reopen, the proposed rule will permit reopening
of proceedings to consider or further consider an application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act if the alien
demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final
order of deportation or exclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several exceptions to these general rules, as required by section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(c)(3).
An alien who is ordered deported 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in absentia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
who can demonstrate that his or her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances may file a motion to reopen
the proceedings within 180 days of the final order. An alien who is ordered deported 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in absentia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
without receiving notice of the proceedings, if notice was required, or who was in federal or state custody at the time
of the proceedings and could not appear, may file a motion to reopen without regard to the above time limitations. The
filing of a motion to reopen proceedings or a motion to reconsider a decision will not serve to stay the execution of
any decision, unless the motion is filed by an alien who was ordered deported 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in absentia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to 8 CFR 3.23(b)(5). As in the past, an alien who files an asylum claim that arises after the initiation of deportation
proceedings against the alien where the claim is based upon an alleged change in circumstances in the country of the
alien's nationality may move to reopen the proceedings at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a party appeals a decision, the notice of appeal must meaningfully identify the reasons for the appeal in order
to avoid summary dismissal. The notice must indicate whether the party will be filing a brief and whether the party
desires oral argument before the Board. An appellant will be provided 30 days in which to file a brief unless the alien
concerned is detained, in which case the appellant will be given 14 days to file a brief. The Immigration Judge or Service
Officer may specify a shorter time in which to file a brief, but only the Board may extend the time for filing, and then
only up to a total of 90 days for good cause shown. An appeal may be withdrawn by either party. In the event the alien concerned
leaves the United States after taking an appeal but prior to a decision, the appeal will be deemed withdrawn. An appeal
will not be permitted when an order of deportation or exclusion has been entered 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in absentia.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule more clearly outlines when the notice of appeal should be filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and when the notice of appeal should be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge. The proposed rule also replaces
the reference to discontinued Form I&hyph;290A with reference to the currently used Form EOIR&hyph;26 for filing
an appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge and Form EOIR&hyph;29 for filing an appeal from a decision of a district
director. The proposed change will eliminate the requirement that the notice of appeal be filed in triplicate. Parties
will still be required to file the original notice of appeal with the office having administrative control over the
record of proceeding and serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the opposing party. The proposed rule will clarify that
a notice of appeal will not be considered filed until the notice is actually received in the office having administrative
control over the record of proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule clarifies that the period for filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration
Judge (Form EOIR&hyph;26) is extended from 10 to 13 days where the decision of the Immigration Judge is served by mail.
The proposed change will clearly define the event that commences the running of the period for filing an appeal and
will reiterate which form should be used to file an appeal and where to file the form. These proposed changes will help
unify practice and procedure throughout the country and will restrict the ability of parties to reopen or continue
proceedings indefinitely. These goals are consistent with the directives of section 545 of IMMACT (8 U.S.C. 1252b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is promulgated as a proposed regulation to allow for comments prior to implementation.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866. In addition, this rule does not have Federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision. A request
to reopen or reconsider any case in which a decision has been made by the Board, which request is made by the Commissioner
or any other duly authorized officer of the Service, or by the party affected by the decision, must be in the form of a
written motion to the Board. The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion
of the Board, subject to the restrictions of this section. The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if
the party moving has made out a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case for relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Motion to reconsider. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed within 20 days after the mailing of the decision or the stating of the
oral decision for which reconsideration is being sought, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule,
whichever is later. When service of the decision is made by mail, 3 days shall be added to the period prescribed for filing
of the motion. A party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of
a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion and
shall be supported by pertinent authority. A motion to reconsider a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge or Service
Officer that is pending when an appeal is filed with the Board, or that is filed subsequent to the filing with the Board
of an appeal from the decision sought to be reconsidered, shall be deemed a motion to remand the decision for further
proceedings before the Immigration Judge or the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal was taken. Such motion,
which shall be consolidated with and considered by the Board in connection with any appeal to the Board, is subject
to the time and numerical limitations of this paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Motion to reopen. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is
granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. A motion to reopen proceedings for the
purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and
all supporting documentation. A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that
evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the
former hearing; nor shall any motion to reopen for the purpose of affording the alien an opportunity to apply for any
form of discretionary relief be granted if it appears that the alien's right to apply for such relief was fully explained
to him or her and an opportunity to apply therefor was afforded at the former hearing, unless the relief is sought on
the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing. Subject to the other requirements and restrictions
of this section, a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for
relief under section 212(c) of the Act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible
for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3), a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must
be filed not later than 20 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding
sought to be reopened, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings:

A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider a decision of the Board pertaining to a matter initially adjudicated by
an officer of the Service shall be filed with the officer of the Service having administrative control over the record
of proceeding; provided, however, that when a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider is made by the Commissioner
or any other duly authorized officer of the Service in proceedings in which the Service has administrative control
over the record of proceedings, the record of proceedings in the case and the motion shall be filed directly with the
Board. In all cases, the motion shall include proof of service on the opposing party and all attachments. The moving
party may only file a brief if it is included with the motion. The opposing party shall have ten days from the date of service
of the motion to submit a brief in opposition to the motion, which shall be filed with the Office where the motion was
filed, along with proof of service of a copy of the brief on the opposing party. The Board, in its discretion, may extend
the time within which such brief is to be submitted. A motion shall be deemed unopposed unless a timely response is made.

(a) A party affected by a decision who is entitled under this chapter to appeal to the Board shall be given notice of his
or her right to appeal. An appeal of a decision of an Immigration Judge shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the
Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR&hyph;26) with the Office of the Immigration
Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding, within the time specified in the governing sections
of this chapter. An appeal of a decision of a Service Officer shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of
Immigration Appeals of Decision of District Director (Form EOIR&hyph;29) with the office of the Service having administrative
control over the record of proceeding, within the time specified in the governing sections of this chapter. A notice
of appeal of a decision of an Immigration Judge is not considered to be filed until the Form EOIR&hyph;26 is actually
received in the appropriate Office of the Immigration Judge and the fee provisions of &sect;3.8 of this part are satisfied.
A notice of appeal of a decision of a district director is not considered to be filed until the Form EOIR&hyph;29 is actually
received in the appropriate office of the Service and the fee provisions of &sect;3.8 of this part are satisfied. The
certification of a case as provided in this part shall not relieve the party affected from compliance with the provisions
of this section in the event that he or she is entitled, and desires, to appeal from an initial decision, nor shall it
serve to extend the time specified in the applicable parts of this chapter for the taking of an appeal. Departure from
the United States of a person in deportation proceedings prior to the taking of an appeal from a decision in his or her
case shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to appeal.

 The party taking the appeal must meaningfully identify the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal in order to
avoid summary dismissal pursuant to &sect;3.1(d)(1&hyph;a)(i) of this part. The statement on the notice of appeal
must specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged. If a question
of law is presented, supporting authority must be cited. If the dispute is over the findings of fact, the specific facts
contested must be identified. Where the appeal concerns discretionary relief, the appellant must state whether
the alleged error relates to statutory grounds of eligibility or to the exercise of discretion and must identify the
specific factual and legal finding or findings that are being challenged. In addition, the statement of the reasons
for appeal must be set forth with sufficient clarity and specificity that the Board may address the appeal without
first reviewing the record and constructing the arguments. The appellant must also indicate in the notice of appeal
whether he or she desires oral argument before the Board and whether he or she will be filing a separate written brief
or statement in support of the appeal.

Briefs in support of or in opposition to an appeal shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge or, where the
appeal is from a decision of a Service Officer, with the officer of the Service having administrative control over
the case. If the alien concerned is not detained, the appellant shall be provided 30 days in which to file a brief unless
a shorter period is specified by the Immigration Judge or by the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal is taken.
If the alien concerned is detained, the appellant shall be provided 14 days in which to file a brief, unless a shorter
period is specified by the Immigration Judge or by the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal is taken. The
appellee shall have the same period of time in which to file a reply brief that was initially granted to the appellant
to file his or her brief. The time to file a reply brief commences from the date upon which the appellant's brief was due,
as originally set or extended by the Board, or the date upon which such brief was filed, whichever is earlier. The Board,
upon motion, may extend the period for filing a brief or a reply brief for up to 90 days for good cause shown and may authorize
the filing of briefs directly with it. If, in its discretion, the Board determines that the interests of justice would
be served thereby, it may consider a brief filed out of time in its adjudication of an appeal. All briefs and motions
regarding the filing of briefs shall include proof of service of the brief or motion on the opposing party.

In any case in which an appeal has been taken, the party taking the appeal may file a written withdrawal thereof with
the office at which the notice of appeal was filed. If the record in the case has not been forwarded to the Board on appeal
in accordance with &sect;3.5 of this part, the decision made in the case shall be final to the same extent as if no appeal
had been taken. If the record has been forwarded on appeal, the withdrawal of the appeal shall be forwarded to the Board
and, if no decision in the case has been made on the appeal, the record shall be returned and the initial decision shall
be final to the same extent as if no appeal had been taken. If a decision on the appeal shall have been made by the Board
in the case, further action shall be taken in accordance therewith. Departure from the United States of a person who
is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to the taking of an appeal but prior to a decision thereon shall
constitute a withdrawal of the appeal and the initial decision in the case shall be final to the same extent as though
no appeal had been taken.

If an appeal is taken from a decision, as provided in this chapter, the entire record of proceeding shall be forwarded
to the Board by the office having administrative jurisdiction over the case upon timely receipt of the briefs of the
parties, or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission of such briefs. After an appeal to the Board has been
filed, a district director or regional service center director need not forward such appeal to the Board, but may reopen
and reconsider any decision made by the director, if the director's new decision will grant the benefit that has been
requested in the appeal, provided that the director's new decision must be served on the appealing party within 45
days of receipt of any briefs or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission of any briefs. If the director's
new decision is not served within these time limits or the appealing party does not agree that the new decision disposes
of the matter, the record of proceeding shall be immediately forwarded to the Board.

order expressly grants a stay or where the motion was filed pursuant to the provisions of &sect;3.23(b)(5). The Board

Whenever, in accordance with the provisions of &sect;3.1(c) of this part, a case is required to be certified to the
Board, the alien or other party affected shall be given notice of certification. An Immigration Judge or Service Officer
may certify a case only after an initial decision has been made and before an appeal has been taken. If it is known at the
time the initial decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the notice of certification shall be included
in such decision and no further notice of certification shall be required. If it is not known until after the initial
decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having
administrative control over the record of proceeding shall cause a Notice of Certification to be served upon the parties.
In either case, the notice shall inform the parties that the case is required to be certified to the Board and that they
have the right to make representations before the Board, including the making of a request for oral argument and the
submission of a brief. If either party desires to submit a brief, it shall be submitted to the office of the Service or
Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding for transmittal to the
Board within the time prescribed in &sect;3.3(c) of this part. The case shall be certified and forwarded to the Board
by the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative jurisdiction over the case upon
receipt of the brief, or upon the expiration of the time within which the brief may be submitted, or upon receipt of a
written waiver of the right to submit a brief. The Board in its discretion may elect to accept for review or not accept
for review any such certified case. If the Board declines to accept a certified case for review, the underlying decision
shall become final on the date of the Board's declination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal or motion filed under this subpart by any person other
than an officer of the Service relating to a proceeding held before an Immigration Judge shall be accompanied by evidence
that the specified fee has been remitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of &sect;&sect;3.38(c) and
103.7 of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal or motion filed under this subpart
by any person other than an officer of the Service relating to a matter involving an adjudication by an officer of the
Service shall be accompanied by the specified fee and remitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of &sect;103.7
of this chapter. In any case in which an alien or other party affected is unable to pay the fee fixed for an appeal or a motion,
he or she shall file with the notice of appeal or the motion his or her affidavit or unsworn declaration, made pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 1746, stating the nature of the motion or appeal and his or her belief that he or she is entitled to redress.
Such document shall also establish his or her inability to pay the required fee, and shall request permission to prosecute
the appeal or motion without payment of such fee. When such a document is filed with the officer of the Service or the
Immigration Judge from whose decision the appeal is taken or with respect to whose decision the motion is addressed,
such Service Officer or Immigration Judge shall, if he or she believes that the appeal or motion is not taken or made
in good faith, certify in writing his or her reasons for such belief for consideration by the Board. The Board may, in
its discretion, authorize the prosecution of any appeal or motion without payment of the required fee.

Reopening/Reconsideration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The Immigration Judge may upon his or her own motion, or upon motion of the trail attorney or the alien, reopen or
reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction in the case is vested in the Board of Immigration
Appeals under part 3 of this chapter. Motions to reopen or reconsider a decision of the Immigration Judge must be filed
with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding. Such motions
shall comply with applicable provisions of 8 CFR 208.4, 208.19, and 242.22. The Immigration Judge may set and extend
time limits for replies to motions to reopen or reconsider. A motion shall be deemed unopposed unless timely response
is made. A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion and shall be supported by pertinent authority.
Any motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application
for relief and all supporting documents. A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied
that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented
at the hearing; nor will any motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity to apply for any form
of discretionary relief be granted if the alien's rights to make such application were fully explained to him or her
by the Immigration Judge and he or she was afforded an opportunity to do so at the hearing, unless circumstances have
arisen thereafter on the basis of which the request is being made. Subject to the other requirements and restrictions
of this section, a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for
relief under section 212(c) of the Act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible
for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A motion to reconsider must be filed within 20 days after the date on which the decision for which reconsideration
is being sought was rendered, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. A party may
file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous
motion to reconsider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4), a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must
be filed not later than 20 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding
sought to be reopened, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(3) shall not apply to a motion to reopen filed pursuant
to the provisions of paragraph (b)(5), or to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum or for withholding
of deportation based on changed circumstances, which arise subsequent to the commencement of proceedings, in the
country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, or to a motion to reopen agreed upon
by all parties and jointly filed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 must be filed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation. The motion must demonstrate that the failure to appear
was because of exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien (such as serious illness of the alien or death
of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection 242B(a)(2)
of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(a)(2), and notice was required pursuant to such subsection; or the alien demonstrates that
the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When requested in conjunction with a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, the Immigration Judge may stay
the execution of a final order of deportation or exclusion. The filing of a motion to reopen pursuant to the provisions
of paragraph (b)(5) shall stay the deportation of the alien pending decision on the motion and the adjudication of
any properly filed administrative appeal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 and MD&hyph;11 series airplanes. This proposal would require the installation of retainers
and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This proposal
is prompted by an analysis conducted by the manufacturer, which revealed that failure of a lateral control mixer bracket
could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recent analysis conducted by the manufacturer revealed that the potential exists for uncommanded spoiler extension
due to failure, for any reason, of a lateral control mixer bracket on Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes. The FAA has
reviewed the results of this analysis and has determined that failure of the lateral control mixer bracket could result
in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler on Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series
airplanes, and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, as well as on Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, since the brackets
are designed similarly on these airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent asymmetric
deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;222 [for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10,
&hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10 (military) airplanes], and MD&hyph;11 Service
Bulletin 27&hyph;34 (for Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993, that describe procedures
for installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar
of the airplane. This installation will minimize the possibility for uncommanded extension of the spoiler in the
event of a bracket failure or separation from the airplane structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket
on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
the applicable service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 427 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A
(military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry
would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the
proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,497
per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of DC&hyph;10 series
airplanes is estimated to be $1,605,542 or $6,662 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 114 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators of Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes is estimated to be $306,452, or $6,662 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing to amend Rule 19b&hyph;4 and Form 19b&hyph;4,
the rule and form that set forth the procedures for the filing by self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') of proposed
rule changes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The amendments would expand the scope of those proposed rule
changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The proposed amendments are intended to expedite
and streamline the process through which proposed rule changes are filed and become effective. The Commission also
is proposing to amend the rules and forms applicable to the annual filing of amendments to registration statements
of national securities exchanges, securities associations, and reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, to streamline those requirements.

Section 3(a)(26) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;78c(a)(26), defines the term ``self-regulatory organization'' to
mean any national securities exchange, registered securities association, registered clearing agency, and, for
purposes of Section 19(b) and other limited purposes, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'').

Section 19(b)(1) of the Act defines the term ``proposed rule change'' to mean ``any proposed rule or rule change in
addition to, or deletion from the rules of [a] self-regulatory organization.'' In turn, Sections 3(a)(27) and 3(a)(28)
of the Act provide, essentially, that the term ``rules of a self-regulatory organization'' means (i) the rules of
the MSRB and the constitution, articles of incorporation, bylaws, and rules, or instruments corresponding to the
foregoing, of any other SRO and (ii) such stated policies, practices, and interpretations of an SRO (other than the
MSRB) as the Commission, by rule, may determine to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors to be deemed to be rules. The Commission has exercised this rulemaking authority in paragraph (b) of Rule
19b&hyph;4 under the Act, which defines the term ``stated policy, practice, or interpretation.''

 sets forth the standards and time periods for Commission action either to approve a proposed rule change or to institute

must either approve the proposed rule change or institute disapproval proceedings within 35 days of the publication
of notice of the filing or within such longer period if the Commission finds appropriate or to which the SRO consents.
The Commission must approve a proposed rule change if it finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the SRO proposing the rule change. If the Commission
does not make that finding, it must institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.
The Commission also may approve a proposed rule change on an accelerated basis prior to 30 days after publication of
the notice if the Commission finds good cause for so doing and publishes its reasons for so finding.

 provides that, in certain circumstances, a proposed rule change may become effective without the notice and approval
procedures required by Section 19(b)(2). Paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) permits certain types of proposed rule
changes to take effect in this manner if appropriately designated by the SRO as within the following categories: (1)
Constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement
of an existing rule of the SRO;

 or (3) concerned solely with the administration of the SRO. Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) also gives the Commission the
authority to expand by rule the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A)
if the Commission determines that the expansion is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of Section
19(b). Rule 19b&hyph;4(e) implements the authority of Section 19(b)(3)(A) by detailing further the scope of proposed
rule changes that may be filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). The rule tracks those categories enumerated in Section
19(b)(3)(A) mentioned above and also includes a category adopted in 1980 relating to registered clearing agencies.

The 1980 amendment, which is similar to the amendments proposed today, expanded the category of filings that qualify
to take effect under Section 19(b)(3)(A) to include those proposed rule changes that relate to mechanical or operational
details of existing clearing agency services and thus are similar to ``solely administrative'' rules. The adopting
release stated that the Commission was not expanding the category at that time to include rule changes of SROs other
than registered clearing agencies, but that it could become appropriate to do so as other SROs developed more varied
and complex services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its Market 2000 Report (``Report''), the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') committed
to working with the SROs to streamline the review of proposed rule changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Division noted in the Report that SROs have argued that the process for the filing, review, and approval of proposed
rule changes is too lengthy and hampers the efforts of the SROs to provide prompt, flexible, and innovative order-entry
and trading services to their members and the investing public.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Division agreed that the rule review process should be expedited for routine procedural and administrative modifications
to existing order-entry and trading systems, but noted that modifications that would restrict access, burden competition,
or modify provisions or procedures designed for the protection of investors should continue to be considered after
the applicable notice and comment period under Section 19(b)(2).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Report also indicated that the Division would consider other types of proposed rule changes that could be subject

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to authority in Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, and consistent with recommendations made in the Market
2000 Report, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 19b&hyph;4 and the instructions to Form 19b&hyph;4 by expanding
the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A). In particular, routine procedural
and administrative modifications to existing order-entry and trading systems would become eligible for filing
under this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that proposed modifications to existing systems that are operational in nature are not likely
to raise the policy concerns that warrant the full notice and comment procedures of Section 19(b)(2).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, the Commission proposes to expand the category of rule filings that are eligible for filing under Section
19(b)(3)(A) to include systems changes that do not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public
interest, do not impose any significant burden on competition, and do not have the effect of limiting access to or availability
of the system.

The Commission's Automated Review Policy II (``ARP II'') sets forth the Commission's views on, among other things,
the circumstances under which an SRO is expected to notify the Commission of expected changes to its automated systems.
As indicated in greater detail therein, the Commission believes that an SRO should provide notification of certain
systems changes not only to inform the Commission for purposes of ARP II, but also to help determine whether the systems
change would require a filing under Rule 19b&hyph;4. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29185 (May 9, 1991), 56 FR

Under the amendment, a proposed rule change that, for example, would increase marginally the maximum number of shares
per order that could be executed through an SRO's small order routing and execution system may be eligible to become
effective upon filing.

In a 1983 letter to the exchanges and the NASD, the staff of the Commission's Division of Market Regulation took the
position that rule changes relating to small-order systems should be filed under Section 19(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In contrast, a proposed rule change involving a systems change that would affect the surveillance or oversight capabilities
of the SRO or other appropriate regulatory authority would not be properly filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). Such
a rule change could directly impair the protection of investors and thus should be filed under Section 19(b)(2). Another
example of a proposed rule change that would not be eligible for filing under Section 19(b)(3)(A) is one that would
make mandatory the use of a particular order-entry or trading system by members. Because such a rule change could impose
burdens on competition, it should be filed for consideration under the more comprehensive procedures of Section
19(b)(2). Similarly, it would be inappropriate to permit a proposed rule change to become effective immediately
if it could have the effect of limiting the access to or availability of the system to members or investors.

B. Other Noncontroversial Rule Filings After Prior Notice to the Commission

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also proposes to amend Rule 19b&hyph;4 and the instructions to Form 19b&hyph;4, pursuant to authority
in Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act, to expand the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective
under Section 19(b)(3)(A) to include certain noncontroversial filings, if the proposed rule change, by its terms,
does not become operative for 30 days after the date of publication of the notice of filing or such shorter time as the
Commission may designate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For these filings, SROs also would be required to provide written notice to the Commission five business days prior
to the filing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Filing this type of proposed rule change under Section 19(b)(3)(A) should allow SROs to implement these rule changes
more quickly than if they were filed under Section 19(b)(2).

This 30 day provision resembles a 1979 proposal by the Commission that featured a 60 day post-filing operation date
which was never adopted. SROs objected primarily because the 60 day provision, when combined with a 30 day pre-filing
circulation period among members, did not provide sufficient incentive to forego filing the proposed rule change
under Section 19(b)(2). The Commission believes that today's proposal addresses these concerns.

For every clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, this notice also would
be filed with the appropriate regulatory agency for the clearing agency as required by Section 17(c)(1) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q(c)(1). Consistent with the requirements of that section, the Commission also would expect the
MSRB to file such notices with each agency enumerated in Section 3(a)(34)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34)(A).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new provision only would apply to those proposed rule changes that are properly designated by the SRO as not significantly
affecting the protection of investors and not imposing any significant burden on competition. For purposes of meeting
this requirement, the impact or burden of a proposed rule change would be significant if, in the view of the Commission
staff or industry participants, the change would require more than a cursory analysis to determine whether the impact
or burden was necessary or appropriate under the Exchange Act. Proposed rule changes meeting these criteria generally
are less likely to engender adverse comments or require the degree of review attendant with more controversial filings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a proposed rule change that adds an existing rule to an SRO's minor rule violation plan, that is objective
in nature, such as a reporting obligation, and that does not involve a violation of the federal securities laws or the
rules thereunder, could be properly filed under this provision. Another example would be a proposed rule change permitting
the transmission of data to or from the SRO by computer interface or other electronic means. A proposed rule change,
however, that would reduce public representation in the administration of the affairs of an SRO or that would amend
the procedures for arbitration or disciplinary proceedings would not be a proper candidate to become effective under
Section 19(b)(3)(A). These types of filings implicate basic policy considerations with respect to the protection
of investors, and should be filed under Section 19(b)(2) to allow for more careful scrutiny. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this new provision, the SRO would have to provide the Commission with written notice of its intent to file the
proposed rule change, along with a brief description and the text of the proposed rule change, at least five business
days prior to the filing date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission expects that such notices will be brief and informal and often will be transmitted by facsimile. This
prior notice would give Commission staff an opportunity to discuss with the SRO whether there exists an adequate basis
upon which the proposed rule change may properly qualify under this provision. Furthermore, the notice could elicit
guidance from Commission staff to help the SRO identify those aspects of a proposed rule change that the Commission
deems important. This should help the SRO articulate in its subsequent filing the purpose and effects of the proposed
rule change, which in turn should further facilitate and expedite the filing process.

The Commission emphasizes that SROs should take extreme care in assuring that all filings express the information
necessary for the Commission's review. Any filings that fail to comply with the requirements of Form 19b&hyph;4 may
be returned to the SRO and will be deemed not to have been filed with the Commission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement that a proposed rule change filed in this manner cannot, by its terms, become operative prior to 30
days after the date of publication of the notice of filing would provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment
prior to the rule's operation. This would allow the Commission, if necessary, to abrogate the rule change before it
became operative in the least disruptive manner possible, if the proposed rule change was determined to be inconsistent
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. This 30-day requirement, however,
could be shortened or waived by the Commission if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that it presently has the authority under Section 19(b)(3)(C)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the Act to abrogate summarily within sixty days of filing any proposed rule change that becomes effective under
Section 19(b)(3)(A). If the proposals to expand the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under
Section 19(b)(3)(A) are adopted, however, the Commission intends to revise its rules to delegate this abrogation
authority to the Director of the Division. This would be necessary to facilitate an expected increase in the volume
of proposed rule changes that would be filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the past five years, the staff of the Commission has acted on over 2,000 SRO rule filings. In addition to submitting
a proposed rule change on Form 19b&hyph;4, the SRO is responsible for preparing and attaching an exhibit to the form
containing the complete notice of the proposed rule change for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Staff of the Commission may amend or supplement this notice in preparing it for publication. If and when the proposed
rule change is approved, staff also prepares an approval order for similar publication. Thus significant staff resources
are devoted to processing these filings and preparing them for publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission therefore is encouraging SROs to submit certain portions of all filings on computer diskette in an
appropriate wordprocessing format. This only would apply to Form 19b&hyph;4 and the notice for publication (Exhibit
1 to Form 19b&hyph;4). The paper version of these documents would continue to be required, but the electronic version
would provide a more efficient way for Commission staff to review and prepare the initial notice for publication in
the

The Commission also is proposing to reduce the number of copies of Form 19b&hyph;4 and Exhibit 1 that SROs must submit,
from twelve to eight, including the manually signed original. The Commission also is correcting miscellaneous outdated
references contained in Form 19b&hyph;4 with respect to the Commission's address and appropriate offices within
the Division to which filings of proposed rule changes should be directed.

Pursuant to Rule 6a&hyph;2, a registered or exempted exchange generally must update its registration annually by
filing amendments on Form 1&hyph;A to reflect any changes in specified information contained in the registration
statement of the exchange or its accompanying exhibits that were not previously reported in an amendment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission adopted amendments in 1983 to permit exchanges to update exhibits containing the constitution, by-laws,
and rules of the exchange and its affiliates only once every three years.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that it can streamline the requirement to file annual amendments for certain exhibits to
exchange registration. This information is either publicly available, becomes available to the Commission through
other means, or is not useful enough to justify the burden placed on the exchanges in collecting and filing it with the
Commission each year. The Commission notes that for certain of these exhibits, Exchange Act rules will continue to
require national securities exchanges to provide the Commission with prompt notification after any action that
renders those exhibits inaccurate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, Rule 17a&hyph;1 will continue to require exchanges to maintain and preserve for prescribed periods
all documents and other records made or received by it in the course of its business and in the conduct of its self-regulatory
activity, and upon request of any representative of the Commission, to promptly furnish such documents.

For the same reasons, the Commission proposes to amend the analogous rules and forms applicable to national securities
associations (namely, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''))
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the MSRB. The NASD has similar requirements to update and file certain information annually, although the form
used for this purpose differs significantly from that used for exchanges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, the registration and amendment forms used by the NASD are organized along the lines of rule categories,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that it would be appropriate to streamline the reporting requirements for these SROs as well,

requirements for exchanges.

IV. Description of Proposal To Amend Requirements for the Annual Filing of Amendments to Registration Statements
of National Securities Exchanges, Securities Associations, and Reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described above, Rule 6a&hyph;2 of the Exchange Act requires an exchange to update and file annually certain amendments
to its registration with the Commission. Exchanges submit these filings on Form 1&hyph;A by referencing the appropriate
exhibit to the exchange registration being amended. Because the Commission believes that this is unnecessary for
much of this information, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 6a&hyph;2 that would eliminate or reduce
this annual filing requirement for the following: Exhibit B (forms pertaining to application for membership and
approval as a person associated with a member); Exhibit C (forms of financial statements, reports, or questionnaires
relating to financial responsibility); Exhibit D (documents comprising listing applications including agreements
required in connection therewith, and a schedule of listing fees); Exhibit I (list of all individual members and related
information); Exhibit J (certain information related to a list of all member organizations of the exchange); and
Exhibit K (schedule of securities listed on the exchange). For all the remaining exhibits, with the exception of Exhibits
E and F, which concern financial statements,
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 exchanges would have the option, in lieu of the annual filing, to publish or cooperate in the publication of this information
on an annual or more frequent basis, and to certify to the accuracy of the information. Exchanges would have the further
option of keeping the information in Exhibits A(1), A(2), A(3), L, and M up to date, and certifying that the information
is up to date and available to the Commission and the public upon request.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission is proposing to add the date of election to membership, if available, as an item to be filed
by exchanges annually under Exhibit J. This is necessary to enable the Commission to monitor the obligation of broker-dealers
to be a member of an SRO.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 It also will help the Commission to designate an appropriate examining authority for each broker-dealer.

The annual filing requirement for these exhibits would be retained because they are necessary to enable the Commission
to comply with Section 23(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78w(b). That section requires the Commission to include
in its report to Congress each year a statement and analysis of the expenses and operations of each SRO.

the constitution, articles of incorporation, by-laws, and rules of each affiliate or subsidiary of the exchange;
Exhibit L contains a schedule of securities admitted to unlisted trading practices; and Exhibit M contains a schedule
of unregistered securities admitted to trading on the exchange which are exempt from registration.

The Commission also is proposing to make corresponding changes, where applicable, to the requirements for the NASD
and MSRB. Thus, the requirement to file certain information annually would be streamlined, and the reporting requirements
for the NASD and the MSRB would be conformed, where appropriate, to the requirements for the exchanges. In addition,
similar to the proposal for exchanges discussed above, for certain information, these SROs would have the option,
in lieu of an annual filing, of identifying the publication in which this information is available or keeping such
information up to date and making it available to the Commission and the public. The Commission is requesting specific
comment on these proposals.

V. Conclusion and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposals described above, if adopted, would expedite and streamline the process
through which SROs file proposed rule changes with the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The proposals also would streamline the requirements to file amendments to registration statements of national
securities exchanges, securities associations, and reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The
Commission requests comment on each of these proposals. The Commission requests specific comment on the amendments
to the annual filing requirements for securities exchanges, securities associations, and the MSRB, with a view toward
maintaining comparable requirements for all SROs.

These amendments may affect clearing agencies for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency
as defined in Section 3(a)(34) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34). Therefore, in accordance with Section 17A(d)(3)(A)(i)
of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(d)(3)(A)(i), at least 15 days before this announcement, the Commission
consulted and requested the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

VI. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact on competition of those
rules, if any, and to balance that impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes
of the Exchange Act. The Commission preliminarily is of the view that adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 19b&hyph;4,
Form 19b&hyph;4, and Rule 6a&hyph;2 would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission requests comment, however, on any competitive burdens that might
result from adoption of these amendments.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'')
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission to undertake an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the proposed amendments on small
entities unless the Chairman certifies that the rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 Rule 19b&hyph;4 and Form 19b&hyph;4 apply only to SROs. Rule 6a&hyph;2 applies only to national securities exchanges.
Furthermore, the proposed amendments are intended to streamline a process to which these SROs already are subject.
The Chairman has certified that the proposed amendments, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

(i) Does not adversely affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of the clearing agency
or for which it is responsible; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Does not significantly affect the respective rights or obligations of the clearing agency or persons using the
service; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Effecting a change in an existing order-entry or trading system of a self-regulatory organization that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing a new rule and proposing to amend its rules
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to reduce existing regulatory distinctions between debt securities listed
on a national securities exchange and those traded in the over-the-counter market. The Commission also is proposing
to simplify registration procedures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for listed debt securities. The proposals
would: exempt listed debt securities from restrictions on borrowing and the proxy rules; provide for the automatic
effectiveness of a Form 8&hyph;A registration statement for listed debt securities; and eliminate the filing fee
associated with the Form 8&hyph;A registration statement for listed debt. Comment also is being requested as to whether
it is advisable to extend reporting requirements to issuers of debt securities that are traded in the over-the-counter
market under certain circumstances where the issuer is not otherwise subject to periodic reporting requirements.

Section 12 of the Exchange Act
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 requires all securities listed on a national securities exchange to be registered under the Exchange Act.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Registration subjects the securities, whether debt or equity, to a number of regulatory provisions, including restrictions
on borrowing,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 periodic reporting by the issuer,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and proxy regulation.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In contrast, debt securities traded in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market are not required to be registered under
the Exchange Act,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and, therefore, such securities are not subject to the restrictions on borrowing or proxy regulation. These regulatory
distinctions may have unnecessarily and unintentionally affected the structure and development of the debt markets.

The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') has advised the Commission that the additional regulatory requirements imposed
on listed debt securities create significant disincentives for issuers to list their debt on the national securities
exchanges and urged that exemptive action be taken to eliminate this disparity. To address this disparate regulatory
treatment between listed and OTC-traded debt, the Commission is proposing to exempt listed debt securities from
the borrowing restrictions and proxy rules under the Exchange Act. Listed debt securities, however, would remain
subject to the registration and reporting requirements. The Commission also is proposing to simplify the registration
process by providing for the immediate effectiveness of Form 8&hyph;A registration statements pertaining to the
listing of debt securities on a national securities exchange and eliminating the filing fee associated with the form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these proposals to ease the regulatory obligations resulting from listing debt securities, the Commission
also is considering whether additional informational requirements should be imposed on issuers of OTC-traded debt
securities. Accordingly, as discussed below, the Commission is requesting comment on the benefits of periodic reporting
requirements with respect to issuers of debt securities and on whether it is advisable to extend those requirements
to issuers of debt securities that are traded in the OTC market, comparable to the requirements applicable to issuers
that list their debt securities on a national securities exchange.

B. Exemption From the Borrowing Restrictions of the Exchange Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the aftermath of the 1929 market crash, Congress enacted the Exchange Act to regulate, among other matters, the
extension of credit in the securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Along with margin provisions,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Congress placed a restriction on the ability of broker-dealers to borrow, in the ordinary course of business, using
exchange-traded securities as collateral. Under Section 8(a) of the Exchange Act,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 a broker-dealer can pledge a listed security, other than an exempted security, only to certain lenders: a member bank
of the Federal Reserve System; a non-member bank that has filed with the Federal Reserve Board an agreement to comply
with those provisions of the federal securities and banking laws that apply to member banks; or another broker-dealer
if such a loan is permissible under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 As noted above, Section 8(a) specifically excludes exempted securities from these restrictions on borrowing. Under
Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 the term ``exempted securities'' includes such securities as the Commission may exempt from the operation of any
one or more provisions of the Exchange Act.

In particular, Section 7(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78g] authorized the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (``Federal Reserve Board'') to prescribe rules and regulations with respect to the amount of credit that may
be initially extended and subsequently maintained on any security traded on a national securities exchange.

In 1968, when Congress extended many of the margin provisions (i.e., Section 7(a)) to securities traded exclusively
in the OTC market,
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Congress placed no comparable restriction on the ability of broker-dealers to borrow against OTC securities.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, a broker-dealer can use bonds that are not listed on an exchange to secure financing from any lender, whether
or not that lender falls within the statutorily enumerated categories.

Congress did not amend Section 8(a), as it amended Section 7(a), to extend that provision to securities traded exclusively

Since that time, various market participants have voiced concerns that Section 8(a) is overly restrictive and competitively
unfair.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 According to these participants, broker-dealers' discretion in financing their positions is unduly constrained
once a debt security is traded on an exchange. In addition, at least one national securities exchange has been informed
by its members that the members may advise an issuer against listing bonds due to the restrictions in Section 8(a).

Given the developments in the OTC market since Congress took action in the 1960s, the current structure of the bond
market and the nature of debt financing, the differential treatment of exchange-listed and OTC-traded debt securities
does not appear to be warranted. In today's highly competitive market environment, the current regulatory scheme
may detract unfairly from broker dealers' ability to finance their positions, and from the national securities exchanges'
ability to obtain debt listings.

The Commission notes that, at this time, most secondary trading in debt securities (including listed debt securities)
takes place in the OTC market; exchange trading of corporate bonds currently accounts for a relatively small percentage
of the daily trading volume in such securities and is often in ``odd-lot'' size. United States Securities and Exchange

recognizes that it places a competitive burden on exchange markets to subject them to more restrictive regulation
than the OTC market, which is, in this case, the primary market for the trading of debt securities.

The Commission is proposing to exempt
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 exchange-traded debt securities from the borrowing restrictions of Section 8(a).
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed exemption to the restrictions on borrowing would eliminate one competitive barrier to the exchange
trading of debt securities. Specifically, to the extent that the restrictions of Section 8(a) may encourage underwriters
and investment bankers to recommend against debt securities being listed, the proposed exemption would eliminate
that impediment to the listing of debt securities on a national securities exchange.

Proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) would exempt debt securities that are traded on a national securities exchange from
the restrictions on borrowing of Section 8(a) of the Exchange Act. A broker-dealer who extends credit on that collateral
would continue to be required to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, including
Regulation T [17 CFR 220.1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the exemption from the restrictions on borrowing could provide certain benefits to the financial system.
Under this proposal, a broker-dealer borrowing against a listed debt security could choose among prospective lenders
based solely upon the terms of the financing that they offer. For instance, the exemption would make it possible for
a broker-dealer to enter into a repurchase agreement with a non-bank institutional investor. This flexibility should
help broker-dealers obtain financing at the lowest available cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the proposed rule, the term ``debt security'' would include any security that is not an ``equity security''
as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is solicited as to whether, in lieu of the proposed definition, the term ``debt security'' should be more specifically
defined. For example, should the term ``debt security'' be defined as: ``(1) A note, bond, debenture or evidence of
indebtedness; (2) a certificate of interest or participation in any such note, bond, debenture or evidence of indebtedness;
or (3) a temporary certificate for, or guarantee of, any such note, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness or certificate;

stock or similar security, certificates of interest or participation in any profit sharing agreement, voting trust
certificate or certificate of deposit for any equity security, limited partnership interest, any security that
is convertible, with or without consideration, into an equity security or any warrant or right to subscribe or purchase

The Commission requests commenters to address the scope of the proposed exemption as well as its merits. Are there
any categories of listed debt securities that should remain subject to the borrowing restrictions? Interested persons
may also wish to comment on how exempting exchange-traded debt securities from Section 8(a) restrictions would affect
investor protection in the debt market, including whether the purposes behind the Exchange Act's credit provisions
would be frustrated as a result. Interested persons may also wish to comment on the proposed rule's impact on the transparency
and liquidity of the market for debt securities.

 By proposing to exempt debt listed on a national securities exchange from the proxy rules, the Commission seeks to
address the disparate application of the proxy rules between listed debt securities and debt securities traded in
the OTC market. The proxy rules principally apply to equity securities, since most debt securities are not listed
on a national securities exchange and thus not subject to the proxy rules.

In 1963, the Commission submitted a report to Congress that set forth its recommendations as to the scope of regulation
needed for the OTC market.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 These recommendations led to the adoption of Section 12(g) in 1964. The Commission concluded that proxy regulation
should not be required with respect to debt securities since Section 14 was designed to protect shareholders and the
solicitation of proxies was ``rarely [a] problem[ ] related to debt securities and, then, most probably in insolvency
cases when other protections were available.''
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 Today, solicitations of debtholders subject to the proxy rules continue to be infrequent, with only 18 such solicitations
having occurred between 1990 and 1993 with respect to NYSE-listed issuers.

In the context of listed debt, the proxy rules, for the most part, cover solicitations to modify the terms of a trust
indenture. Given the strictures already imposed by the indenture contract, as well as the Trust Indenture Act, comment
is solicited as to whether the benefits to debtholders from the application of the proxy rules to debt securities listed
on a national securities exchange outweigh the costs to the issuers in complying with the proxy rules in connection
with proxy or consent solicitations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the proxy rules provide important protections with respect to publicly-traded debt securities that should be
preserved, does the need for these protections derive from the listing of the security on a national securities exchange
or rather because it is traded in the public debt markets? If the latter is the case, should the Commission seek to extend
the proxy rules to all publicly-traded debt securities, similar to the treatment of equity securities under Section
12(g) of the Exchange Act? Comment also is solicited as to whether an issuer's solicitation of holders of debt securities
listed on a national securities exchange should remain subject to the antifraud proscriptions of Rule 14a&hyph;9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and/or the rules adopted under Section 14 of the Exchange Act to facilitate the transmission of proxy and consent materials
to beneficial owners,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 even if exempted from other proxy regulation. Finally, is the application of the proxy rules currently part of the
expectations of the parties negotiating an indenture agreement, or of investors purchasing a listed debt security?
If so, should the proposed exemption be prospective in nature and thus inapplicable to classes of debt listed before
the effective date of the exemption?

When Congress first began to consider the need for 12(g), an earlier version of Senate Bill 1168 would have subjected
issuers with more than $1 million of debt securities outstanding to registration and the proxy rules. The Senate Committee

financial standpoint, by the fixed dollar obligation in the debt contract than are holders of equity securities,
and hence eliminated the debt security test from the provisions of the bill.'' S. Rep. No. 700, 85th Cong., 1 Sess. 6

 Currently, Form 8&hyph;A registration statements must be declared effective by the staff, pursuant to delegated
authority, which necessitates coordination among the issuer, its counsel, the Commission staff, and the national
securities exchange. A rule change is proposed to provide for the automatic effectiveness of registration statements
on Form 8&hyph;A, including amendments, that pertain only to the listing of debt securities on a national securities
exchange.

 In the case where debt securities of the class being registered were concurrently being registered under the Securities
Act, the Form 8&hyph;A would become effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of the related Securities Act
registration statement if certification by the national securities exchange had been received by the Commission
on or before the effectiveness of the related Securities Act registration statement. If, however, that class of debt
securities was not concurrently being registered under the Securities Act, then the Form 8&hyph;A would become effective
upon filing if certification by the exchange had been received by the Commission on or before the filing of the form.

The Commission will accept the filing of a combined Form 8&hyph;A and NYSE Listing Application on behalf of any issuer
listing debt securities on the NYSE. The combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application will include all the current
disclosure requirements of Form 8&hyph;A and the listing application requirements of NYSE. The NYSE intends to assist
its listed companies by filing the combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application with the Commission on behalf of the
issuer and as its agent. The issuer, however, may choose to file the Form 8&hyph;A itself. Regardless of whether the
issuer or the national securities exchange files the Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application, the issuer is solely responsible
for the filing and its contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National securities exchange representatives wishing to use a similar procedure should contact Joseph P. Babits
at (202) 942&hyph;2910. National securities exchanges that intend to use a combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application
that will become effective upon filing must confirm that the combined Form has been in fact filed with the Commission
prior to the commencement of trading in the class of securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A national securities exchange using such a procedure may wish to make Form 8&hyph;A filings with the Commission in
paper, whether or not the registrant is subject to mandated electronic filing via the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR). Accordingly, the Division of Corporation Finance will consider requests
for a continuing hardship exemption pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.202] from any national
securities exchange filing Forms 8&hyph;A on behalf of electronic filers.

In addition, the Commission proposes to eliminate the $250 filing fee for registering a class of debt securities on
Form 8&hyph;A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Form 8&hyph;A would be revised to add two new boxes, one of which the issuer would check to signify it is a debt registration
requiring no fee and that the Form 8&hyph;A: (1) Is to be effective automatically upon filing, as no debt securities
of the class being registered on the form are being registered concurrently under the Securities Act; or (2) is to be
effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of a related Securities Act registration statement. Comment is
solicited as to whether these proposed amendments address the procedural and timing concerns of issuers listing
debt securities on a national securities exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposals do not exempt listed debt securities from registration and reporting under the Exchange Act. Companies
that list their debt securities for trading in the public market will still have to provide annual, quarterly, and
current reports. This raises the question as to the need for similar requirements for issuers with substantial amounts
of debt securities traded in the OTC market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Congress amended the Exchange Act in 1964 to add Section 12(g), it extended registration to the OTC market for
the first time. However, the 1964 amendments focused exclusively on issuers of equity securities. No comparable
provision was provided for debt securities that are traded in the OTC market. This difference in regulatory treatment
was not based on a policy decision that current financial information is not important to the market. Rather, the decision
appears to have been based, at least in part, on the nature of the debt securities market in 1963. At that time, it was
considered unnecessary to extend registration to debt securities trading in the OTC market, as it appeared that a
company that had a significant amount of debt securities outstanding would probably meet the Section 12(g) threshold
with respect to its equity securities.

Specifically, in its 1963 Special Study, the Commission cited the results of a questionnaire it used in, among other
matters, determining whether debtholders independently needed the protections of Section 13, 14, and 16 of the Exchange
Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
38
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The questionnaire sought information about outstanding debt securities, face dollar amount, and number of holders.
While acknowledging the small number of respondents to the questionnaire, the Commission found that of 218 issuers
that responded, only 58 would not have incurred a reporting obligation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Of these issuers, 45% had less than $250,000 face amount of debt securities outstanding, 60% less than $500,000 outstanding,
and 76% less than $1,000,000.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission concluded that the proposed Section 12(g) equity threshold would make financial reports publicly
available to a large majority of debtholders. Furthermore, the aggregate sums lent by issuers that would not be subject
to any reporting obligation tended to be modest. Thus, the 1963 Special Study recommended to Congress that Section
12(g) not apply to debt securities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, the increasing use of leveraged buyouts that concentrated equity ownership below Section 12(g) thresholds
resulted in a number of companies with significant outstanding debt securities that are not reporting companies.
Concerns have been expressed about the lack of information being available to the market regarding the issuers of
some of these securities.

 In the case of privately placed debt securities traded in the OTC market, no registration or periodic reporting under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

to suspend their reporting obligations after one year when a class of securities are held by fewer than 300 record holders.

As applied, most issuances of debt securities are viewed as separate classes of debt. Therefore, it is not uncommon
for a company that sells registered debt securities not to have a 15(d) reporting obligation after its first year.
While there may be more than 300 holders of record for all the registered debt of a company, it is not uncommon that there
are fewer than 300 holders of record for any one issue.

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance recently examined information on companies that had more than 5 million
dollars of debt securities outstanding to determine whether the companies were reporting with the Commission. The
staff concluded that there are at least 200 non-reporting issuers, with over $47 billion of debt securities outstanding.

Comment is solicited as to whether it is now desirable for the Commission to adopt rules or exercise definitional authority
under the Exchange Act or Trust Indenture Act to increase the number of issuers with debt securities traded in the OTC
market that would be subject to periodic reporting. For example, are periodic reports needed for companies that have
issued debt securities but subsequently suspended their reporting obligations pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act? Comment also is solicited as to whether, even in the absence of a registered offering, an issuer of debt
securities should be subject to an Exchange Act reporting obligation, similar to the provisions governing the registration
of equity under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such reporting obligations are needed, should the thresholds be based upon the total dollar amount of debt securities
outstanding, the number of record or beneficial holders, and/or other criteria? If the number of holders, comment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and benefits that may result from the proposals, commenters
are requested to provide views and data relating to any costs and benefits associated with these proposals. The proposals
are expected to decrease the net costs to issuers associated with listing debt securities on a national securities
exchange, without materially diminishing the benefits to investors. Among other matters, the proposals would exempt
the class of debt securities from the restrictions on borrowing and the proxy rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs to investors associated with these proposed rules and revisions are minimal. Currently, an issuer is not
required to register debt securities under the Exchange Act in order for those securities to be traded in the OTC market.
By reducing the regulatory costs of listing debt on a national securities exchange, it is expected that more issuers
will list such securities and thus register under the Exchange Act.

IV. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 for the proposed rule
and amendments to Rule 12b&hyph;7, 12d1&hyph;2, and Form 8&hyph;A. The analysis notes that the proposals are expected
to reduce regulatory costs for small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes would affect persons that are small entities, as defined
by the Commission's rules. The exemptions provided by Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and revisions to Rules 12b&hyph;7, 12d1&hyph;2,
and Form 8&hyph;A are expected to decrease the compliance burdens of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters are encouraged to comment on any aspect of the analysis. Such comments will be considered in the preparation
of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the proposed rule and amendments are adopted. A copy of the analysis
may be obtained by contacting Joseph P. Babits, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish permanent special local regulations for the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix
held annually in the Atlantic Ocean off Ocean City. The effect of these regulations will be to restrict general navigation
in the regulated area for the safety of spectators and participants. These regulations are needed to provide for the
safety of life, limb, and property on the navigable waters during the event.

Discussion of Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The United States Offshore Racing Association annually sponsors the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix. Each year the
United States Offshore Racing Association requests that the Coast Guard provide control of spectator and commercial
traffic within the regulated area, as part of their application. Since this is a regular, yearly event, the Coast Guard
proposes to develop a special local regulation. Specifically the Coast Guard seeks to regulate the waterways surrounding
the race course. The course runs from Ocean City Inlet to Maryland Beach. To provide for the safety of participants,
spectators, and vessels transiting the area, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area.
A temporary spectator anchorage area will be established for what is expected to be a large spectator fleet. Coast
Guard patrol vessels will be positioned at Ocean City Inlet to direct vessels around the regulated area, or to the temporary
spectator anchorage area. The sponsor usually provides 29 vessels to assist the Coast Guard and local government
agencies in patrolling the event. Medical vessels will display flourescent orange placards, and patrol boats will
display flourescent green placards.

Regulatory Evaluation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This regulation will only be in effect for several hours, one day a year, and the
impact on routine navigation is expected to be minimal.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small Entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). It is anticipated that the impact of this proposal on non-participating small entities will actually
benefit their business due to the increase in local tourism. The Coast Guard will certify under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The Coast Guard proposes to limit the number of openings of the East Sunrise Boulevard Drawbridge, mile 1062.6 at Fort
Lauderdale during certain periods. This proposal is being made to relieve highway congestion created by back-to-back
bridge openings while still meeting the reasonable needs of navigation.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new drawbridge presently opens on signal. Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr. requested that the Coast Guard conduct
a study to determine whether scheduled openings would improve traffic conditions in the area. The bridge owner (Florida
Department of Transportation) recommended hour and half-hour openings on weekdays and 20-minute openings on weekends
during the season to reduce traffic delays. A Coast Guard evaluation of the proposal concluded that the very light
highway traffic levels for this six-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed
opening schedules. However, in order to eliminate back-to-back openings during the tourist season which create
traffic congestion, a 15-minute opening schedule appears to be warranted.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard tested a 15-minute opening schedule between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily from December 1, 1993 through January
30, 1994, pursuant to a published Notice of Deviation (58 FR 65668; December 16, 1993). No comments were received in
response to the Notice of Deviation. The results of the test indicated traffic backups created by back-to-back openings
were reduced. The proposed rule would allow for a 15-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
daily during the season (November 15th through May 15th).

navigation.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs
with tows.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since tugs with tows are exempt from this proposal, the economic impact is expected to be so minimal, the Coast Guard
certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to change regulations governing the operation of the Hillsboro Boulevard (SR 810) drawbridge,
mile 1050.0 at Deerfield Beach, Florida, by permitting the draw to remain closed for a longer period of time during
the winter season. This proposal is being made to relieve highway congestion created by bridge openings while still
meeting the reasonable needs of navigation.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This drawbridge presently opens on signal, except that from October 1 through May 31, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., the draw
opens only on the hour, quarter-hour, half-hour and three-quarter hour. Mayor Sussman requested that the Coast Guard
change the operating regulations to provide for hour and half-hour drawbridge openings. The bridge owner (Florida
Department of Transportation) recommended a change to a 20-minute opening schedule during the season to reduce traffic
delays.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Coast Guard analysis of highway traffic and bridge opening data provided by the bridge owner and four on-site investigations
of the waterway holding conditions and local traffic patterns which were concluded on May 5, 1994, established that
the highway traffic levels for this four-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed
hour/half-hour opening schedule. However, in order to reduce drawbridge openings and periodic traffic congestion
during the tourist season, a 20-minute opening schedule appears to be warranted.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would allow for a 20-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily during
the season (October 1st through May 31st).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This schedule would reduce the number of bridge openings and help to reduce highway traffic delays. The Coast Guard
has a continuing concern for the safety of navigation while vessels are waiting for a bridge opening. As noted in the
``Coast Pilot'', the Hillsboro Drainage Canal immediately north of the bridge creates strong cross currents in the
Intracoastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterway channel during certain tidal conditions. These currents could cause a vessel to strike the northeast fender
system if a mariner is unaware of the local currents or if the vessel is underpowered and had to come about in the stream.
Mariners are encouraged to comment on this navigational safety issue.

This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs
with tows.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since tugs with tows are exempt from this proposal, the economic impact is expected to be so minimal, the Coast Guard
certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreign-Trade Zone 50_Long Beach, CA, Request for Export Manufacturing Authority, J.M. William &amp; Company,
Inc., (Poly/Cotton Bed Linens) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Port of Long Beach, California,
grantee of FTZ 50, requesting authority on behalf of the J.M. William &amp; Company, Inc., to manufacture textile
bed linens under zone procedures for export within FTZ 50. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions
of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part
400). It was formally filed on May 20, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The company plans to manufacture bed sheet sets, comforters and pillows. The primary input is woven polyester/cotton
fabric (HTSUS 5513(14).41, duty rate: 17%), which is sourced from abroad (primarily from China). Additional foreign
materials that may be used in the future include woven fabric of artificial/synthetic fibers, sewing thread, and
nonwoven fill. The application indicates that zone procedures would be used only for export manufacturing activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The company would export all products made with foreign fabric and other foreign textile mill products admitted to
the zone. Zone procedures would exempt it from U.S. quota requirements and Customs duty payments on the foreign items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is [30 days
from date of publication]. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be
submitted during the subsequent 10-day period (to [40 days from date of publication]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be available for public inspection at the following

In accordance with sections 353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman,
in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with section 353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the Commerce
Regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.

INITIATION OF INVESTIGATIONS:

The Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 9, 1994, we received a petition in proper form filed by the BIC Corporation (``petitioner''), the sole U.S. Producer
of disposable pocket lighters. Petitioner filed supplements to the petition on May 23 and 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC and Thailand
are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury
to, a U.S. industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because the BIC Corporation is an interested party, as
defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and it is the sole domestic producer of disposable pocket lighters. If
any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register
support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the assistant Secretary
for Import Administration.

Scope of Investigations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Products covered by these investigations are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not liquefied hydrocarbon,
or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a
gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would
be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs
purposes, our written descriptions of the scope of these proceedings are dispositive.

United States Price and Foreign Market Value_The People's Republic of China
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based United States Price (``USP'') on a 1994 sale made on a packed, c.i.f., duty-paid, delivered basis
to a U.S. purchaser of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC. Petitioner deducted ocean freight, marine insurance,
commission, harbor maintenance fee, and customs processing fee from this price to arrive at an f.o.b. value for the
imports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner contends that the foreign market value (``FMV'') of disposable pocket lighters subject to this investigation
must be determined in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns non-market economy (``MNE'') countries.
The Department has determined the PRC to be an NME, within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act, in previous
cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the PRC, May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28053)). In
accordance with 771(18)(C) of the Act, that determination continues to apply for purposes of this initiation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide
relevant information and argument on this issue. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation
to submit comments on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the PRC consistent with section 773(c)(1)(B)
of the Act (

 Amendment to Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Amendment to Antidumping Duty Order: Chrome-Plated
Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 15052 (April 24, 1992)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, petitioner provided two alternative approaches for determining FMV. In the first approach, in accordance
with section 773(c) of the Act, petitioner attempted to base FMV on the NME producers' factors of production valued
in a market economy country at a comparable level of economic development. Petitioner, however, was unable to obtain
information on the factors of production in the PRC. Therefore, petitioner used its own factors of production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In valuing the factors or production, petitioner used India and Pakistan as surrogate countries. For purposes of
this invitation, we have accepted India and Pakistan as surrogates because their economies are at a level of development
comparable to the PRC's. (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Memorandum to David L. Binder, Director-Division II, Office of Antidumping Investigations from David P. Mueller,
Director, Office of Policy, dated August 1993, regarding non-market economy status and surrogate country selection,
on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Department of Commerce.) Also, there is evidence on the record that India is a producer
of comparable merchandise, as required by section 773(c)(4) of the Act. When cost information was not available in
either of these countries, petitioner valued the factor using its own costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act, petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of values assigned to materials,
labor, energy, and overhead. Petitioner adjusted certain factor values for inflation. Pursuant to section 773(e)(1)
of the Act, petitioner added to the labor and material costs, and general expenses, the statutory minimum of eight
percent for profit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In making its allegation of sales at less than fair value based on the factors of production methodology, petitioner
relied extensively on U.S. costs for valuing the factors. Although the Department has accepted similar allegations
in past antidumping investigations against the PRC, we prefer that the NME producers' factors be used and that they
be valued in a comparable market economy, which is a significant producer of the merchandise. In response to our concern
in this regard, petitioner provided a secondary basis for determining FMV, using prices from a market economy country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773(c)(2) of the Act provides that FMV may be based on the price at which comparable merchandise produced in
a market economy country is sold in other countries, including the United States. In accordance with section 773(c)(2)
of the Act, petitioner provided information on the price at which disposable pocket lighters from the Philippines
are being sold for export to the United States. For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted the Philippines as
a surrogate country, because its economy is at a level of development comparable to the PRC's. (

memoradnum to David L. Binder, Director-Division II, Office of Antidumping Investigations from David P. Mueller,
Director, Office of Policy, dated December 4, 1991, regarding non market economy status and surrogate country selection,
on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Department of Commerce.) There is also evidence on the record that the Philippines
is a producer of comparable merchandise, as required by section 773(c)(4) of the Act. Because the Philippine import
price was on an f.o.b. basis, petitioner made no adjustments to this price.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that disposable pocket lighters from the PRC
are being, or are likely to be, sold at less than fair value. The comparison of USP and FMV in the petition indicates a
margin of 332.43 percent when FMV is based on factor values and a margin of 197.85 percent when FMV is based on Philippine
export prices. It it becomes necessary at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available
(BIA), we may review these calculation bases.

Petitioner was unable to obtain actual sales price information on which to base USP. Petitioner, therefore, based
USP on the customs value of imports from Thailand, as reported in the Department of Commerce IM&hyph;146 import statistics.
No adjustments were made to these prices, because they were reported on an f.o.b. basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner also was unable to obtain actual prices for sales in Thailand or for export to third countries. Accordingly,
petitioner based FMV on its own costs, adjusted for known differences between the costs of petitioner and Thai producers.

Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that disposable pocket lighters from Thailand
are being, or are likely to be, sold at less than fair value. Furthermore, the comparison of USP and FMV in the petition
indicates a margin of 172.78 percent. If it becomes necessary at a later date to consider the petition as a source of
BIA, we may review these calculation bases.

Initiation of Investigations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have examined the petition on disposable pocket lighters and have found that it meets the requirements of section
732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of
disposable pocket lighters from the PRC and Thailand are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less
than fair value.

Preliminary Determination by the ITC
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITC will determine by June 23, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of disposable pocket
lighters from the PRC and Thailand are causing material injury, or threaten to cause material injury, to a U.S. industry.
A negative ITC determination will result in the investigations being terminated; otherwise, these investigations
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 27, 1993, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(58 FR 68393) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping finding on tuners from Japan (December 12, 1970).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
this antidumping finding to each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of tuners from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 8529.90.10 and 8529.90.50. the HTS numbers are provided for
convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for four consecutive review periods (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(i)) and when
no domestic interested party objects to revocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping finding
on tuners from Japan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping
finding in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of tuners from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after December 1, 1993. Entries made during the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993,
will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs
Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after December 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping
duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 705(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act'') (19 U.S.C. section 1671d(a)),
on April 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') made its final determination that manufacturers,
producers or exporters in Italy of grain-oriented electrical steel receive benefits which constitute subsidies
within the meaning of the countervailing duty law (59 FR 18357, April 18, 1994). On May 27, 1994, in accordance with
section 705(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') notified the Department of its final
affirmative determination that imports of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy are materially injuring
a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, pursuant to section 706(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. section 1671e(a)(1)), the Department hereby directs
U.S. Customs officers to assess a countervailing duty equal to the amount of the estimated net subsidy on all entries
of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy. This countervailing duty will be assessed on all unliquidated entries
of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy which were entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,
on or after February 1, 1994, the date on which the Department published its preliminary countervailing duty determination
in the

The Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 9, 1994, we received a petition in proper form filed by the BIC Corporation on behalf of the United States disposable
pocket lighter (``disposable lighters'') industry. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.12, petitioner alleges that manufacturers,
producers, or exporters of the subject merchandise in Thailand receive benefits which constitute bounties or grants
within the meaning of section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

Injury Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although Thailand is not a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the merchandise
being investigated is non-dutiable under the Generalized System of Preferences and Thailand is a contracting party
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Therefore, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) is required
to determine whether imports of the subject merchandise from Thailand materially injure, or threaten material injury
to, a U.S. industry.

Petitioner has stated that it is an interested party, as defined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and that it has filed
the petition on behalf of the U.S. industry producing disposable lighters. If any interested party, as described
under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to,
this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration,
in accordance with 19 CFR 355.31.

Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential countervailing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not refillable, whose fuel
is butane, isobutane, propane, or other liquified hydrocarbon, or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor
pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable
pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although
the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written descriptions of the scope of
this proceeding is dispositive.

Initiation of Investigation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has examined the petition on disposable lighters from Thailand and found that it complies with the
requirements of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating
a countervailing duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers or exporters of disposable
lighters receive countervailable bounties or grants. The following programs are included in our investigation.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 27, 1993, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 68392) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty orders on staple machines and staples from Sweden
(December 20, 1983).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
these antidumping duty orders to each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties
who might object to these revocations were provided 30 days to submit their comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Orders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by these revocations are shipments of staple machines and staples from Sweden. This merchandise
is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 8305.20.00 and 8422.30.90. The
HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for four consecutive review periods (19 CFR 352.25(d)(4)(i))
and when no domestic interested party objects to revocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty orders
on staple machines and staples from Sweden are no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are
revoking these antidumping duty orders in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revocations apply to all unliquidated entries of staple machines and staples from Sweden entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993. Entries made during the period December 1, 1992, through
November 30, 1993, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will
instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties,
and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.25(d).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from November 1, 1994, to October 31, 1995, is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Bakersfield, California Geographic Service Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from November 1, 1994, to October 31, 1995, is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Salinas, California Geographic Service Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) has identified and resolved a potential conflict of interest
situation related to its contractor, Mr. Duane C. Sewell. This Notice satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 1706.8(e)
with respect to publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the Board's Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interests Regulations, 10 CFR part 1706 (OCI Regulations),
an organizational or consultant conflict of interest (OCI) means that because of other past, present or future planned
activities or relationships, a contractor or consultant is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance
or advice to the Board, or the objectivity of such offeror or contractor in performing work for the Board is or might
be otherwise impaired, or such offeror or contractor has or would have an unfair competitive advantage. While the
OCI Regulations provide that contracts shall generally not be awarded to an organization where the Board has determined
that an actual or potential OCI exists and cannot be avoided, the Board may waive this requirement in certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's mission is to provide advice and recommendations to the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding public health
and safety matters related to DOE's defense nuclear facilities. This includes the review and evaluation of the content
and implementation of health and safety standards including DOE orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating
to the design, construction, operation, and decommissioning of DOE defense nuclear facilities. In late 1991, Congress
amended the Board's enabling Act, broadening the Board's jurisdiction over defense nuclear facilities to include
the assembly, disassembly, and testing of weapons. With this increase in responsibility, the Board revised its priorities
to include reviews of additional facilities, including principally the Pantex Plant, Nevada Test Site (NTS), the
weapons design laboratories, and additional facilities at Oak Ridge Y&hyph;12 Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two matters of immediate concern to the Board were the safety of ongoing weapons disassembly operations and maintenance
of the capability to safely conduct nuclear testing operations. While the DOE had been engaged in these activities
for decades, significant changes in the national security posture resulted in shifts in emphasis within DOE. Unprecedented
numbers of simultaneous nuclear weapon retirements strained DOE's capabilities to develop and implement safe and
well-engineered procedures. A Congressionally-mandated and Presidentially-extended nuclear testing moratorium
removed the primary mechanism (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an active, on going testing program) by which the capability to execute tests safely was exercised and ensured. At
the same time, the weapons programs at the nuclear weapons laboratories were losing skilled and experienced personnel
due to retirement, downsizing, and reassignments. This combination of issues required the Board to increase its
attention, and with it the number of associated reviews, at both Pantex and the NTS. Further, the Board recognized
that it needed individuals with expertise in multiple technical disciplines, not previously required, to effectively
meet the challenges and responsibilities of its new authority. These technical disciplines included conventional
and nuclear explosive technology and safety, nuclear materials handling and storage, criticality safety, and nuclear
weapons assembly, disassembly, storage and testing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Board initiated an employee recruitment effort for individuals with formal training and experience in
weapons related disciplines, it also recognized a need for technical assistance from outside experts who have direct
relevant experience in this area. The Board identified Mr. Duane C. Sewell as an individual with the requisite knowledge
and experience needed to provide the Board with immediate assistance in the weapons area. Specifically, Mr. Sewell
can and will provide the Board with expertise in strategic safety issues associated with defense nuclear facilities
involved in the assembly, disassembly, and testing of nuclear weapons, as well as assistance in the planning and performance
of the Board's oversight functions at such facilities. The scope of work will be limited to those operations associated
with production, dismantlement/disposition, safe handling, testing, and storage of nuclear weapons, nuclear
explosive devices, and nuclear weapons components, and the nuclear and hazardous materials used in these items.
A major portion of Mr. Sewell's effort will be directed toward assisting the Board in understanding the existing and
needed involvement of the DOE weapons design laboratories in these activities, and evaluating the sufficiency of
current and proposed efforts. He is not expected to become involved, however, in detailed technical reviews of operations
at defense nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a routine preaward review, Mr. Sewell informed the Board of a potential conflict of interest situation arising
from his current and past association with DOE and its weapons program. Mr. Sewell's involvement with this nation's
nuclear weapons development activities dates back to 1941, when he joined the Manhattan Project. He has been associated
with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL or the Laboratory) since it was established in 1952 and has held
positions of increasing authority and responsibility, including Deputy Director. Although he retired from LLNL
in July 1993, the Regents of the University of California (the operator of LLNL) awarded Mr. Sewell the title of Deputy
Director Emeritus and provided him with an office and secretary at the Laboratory. Since that time, he has been using
the office of LLNL approximately twice a week. While the time spent at LLNL is his own, and without pay, he occasionally
provides advice to individuals who are currently directly involved in Laboratory activities at Pantex regarding
the disassembly of nuclear weapons designed by LLNL. Additionally, for the year prior to his retirement, Mr. Sewell
was directly involved with Laboratory activities regarding Pantex, and he attended meetings in May 1993 with the
management and operating contractor of that facility to discuss weapons disassembly procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the Board had concerns regarding actual or potential conflicts of interest based primarily on two
issues. First, would Mr. Sewell's continuing relationship with LLNL as Deputy Director Emeritus affect his ability
to provide impartial assistance or advice to the Board. Second, would Mr. Sewell be placed in a situation as a consultant
to the Board where he would be reviewing his own work on weapons-related matters conducted within a few years of his
retirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board reviewed this situation and concluded that, even if the circumstances could give rise to a potential conflict
of interest situation, it is nonetheless in the best interests of the Government to have Mr. Sewell provide this support
for the reasons described below. Mr. Sewell's comprehensive knowledge of weapons development and assembly procedures,
gained through approximately fifty years of direct experience, is invaluable to the Board in its health and safety
reviews of weapons disassembly and related activities and thus is vital to the Board program. His experience includes
the initial organization of the LLNL weapon testing operations in the early 1950's, and serving as Chairman of the
Nevada Test Site Planning Board, Deputy Director of LLNL in 1973, and Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs of
DOE from 1978 to 1981. In the last position, he was responsible for DOE defense programs, which included: Research,
development, testing, production, and maintenance of all nuclear warheads; defense nuclear materials production,
safeguard and security of all DOE materials and operations; and international security affairs related to nuclear
matters. Furthermore, the Board recognized that it is unlikely that the work to be performed by Mr. Sewell could be
satisfactorily performed by anyone whose experience and affiliations would not give rise to a conflict-of-interest
question. That is because the individuals who have the requisite expertise in this area could only have obtained such
expertise through previous or current employment or consulting relationship with one or more of the weapons designs
laboratories. The pertinent experience of other qualified individuals would therefore likely raise similar conflicts
questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also examined Mr. Sewell's current relationship with LLNL and the University of California. As noted above,
LLNL provides him with an office and clerical support, but the value of those services is unlikely to be large enough
to affect his objectivity in his work for the Board. Also, although Mr. Sewell does not receive any compensation from
LLNL currently, he does participate in the University of California Retirement Plan and a related savings plan and
defined-contribution plan maintained by the University of California. However, he has informed the Board that the
pension from the University of California is vested, and the amount paid calculated according to fixed formulas,
and that his payments from the other plans depend on the levels of prior contributions and ongoing investment returns
rather than on the financial condition of the University of California. The possibility that he could use his work
for the Board in the weapons complex to affect the ability of the University of California to make the vested pension
payments to him is remote. Accordingly, the Board concluded that Mr. Sewell's financial interest in the University
of California and his current LLNL privileges are not so substantial as to be likely to affect the integrity of his services
in advising the Board on DNFSB matters, including, without limitation, any matters affecting LLNL, Los Alamos National
Laboratory, or NTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as the Board is required under its OCI Regulations, where reasonably possible, to initiate measures which
attempt to mitigate an OCI, Mr. Sewell and the Board agreed to the following restrictions during contract performance.
The Board will not task Mr. Sewell to review issues which would involve the direct assessment of LLNL program activities
at LLNL, Pantex, or elsewhere in the complex. In fact, as noted above, since Mr. Sewell will assist the Board on strategic
safety issues, he is not expected to be involved in any assessments of specific program activities. Also, the efforts
of Mr. Sewell will be overseen by experienced technical staff of the Board to ensure that all of his resultant work products
are impartial and contain full support for any findings and recommendations issued thereunder. Further, Mr. Sewell
will not use the clerical support made available to him by LLNL in his work for the Board and he will avoid any discussions
with LLNL employees regarding the work of the Board. Mr. Sewell has agreed to all of these restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on the basis of the determination described above and pursuant to the applicable provisions of 10 CFR
part 1706, the Chairman of the Board granted a waiver of any conflicts of interests (and the pertinent provisions of
the OCI Regulations) with the Board's contract with Mr. Duane C. Sewell that might arise out of his previous or existing
relationship with LLNL.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The applicant is exploring two alternatives for the proposed project. The first alternative would consist of: (1)
Sea Alaska's existing Mellen Lake; (2) a 10-foot-high concrete dam raising the surface elevation of that lake about
8 feet; (3) a 2,600-foot-long, 48-inch-diameter steel penstock; (4) a powerhouse containing an unspecified number
of generating units with a total installed capacity of 2,000 kW; and (5) a tailrace returning water to Reynolds Creek.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second alternative would consist of: (1) the Haida Corporation's existing Summit Lake; (2) a 10-foot-high concrete
dam raising the surface elevation of that lake about 8 feet; (3) a 2,600-foot-long, 48-inch-diameter steel penstock;
(4) a powerhouse containing an unspecified number of generating units with a total installed capacity of 1,500 kW;
and (5) a tailrace returning water to Reynolds Creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both alternatives would also include a 10-mile-long transmission line interconnecting with an existing Alaska
Power and Telephone distribution system and other appurtenant facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new access roads will be needed to conduct the studies.

 Training Verification Program for Implementation of the Revised Federal Work Protection Standards. (ICR No: 0277.09;
OMB No: 2070&hyph;0060). This is a request for the approval of revised burden hours for requirements under Section
3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The current approval expires on February 28,
1995.

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 21, 1992, EPA issued final regulations revising its Worker Protection Standards (WPS) for agricultural
pesticides (40 CFR part 170 and 40 CFR part 156, subpart K). The revised regulations strengthen the requirements for
the protection of agricultural workers and pesticide handlers from hazards of pesticides used on farms, on forests,
in nurseries and in greenhouses. The regulations require that each agricultural worker and pesticide handler be
trained in pesticide safety to reduce the risk of pesticide poisoning and other injuries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WPS specified what safety information must be provided to workers and handlers; the WPS also provides for the issuance
of EPA-approved WPS training certificates upon completion of training. This certification process allows employers
to verify that workers and handlers have received WPS safety training. However, to relieve agricultural employers
from the responsibilities of retraining migrant workers and handlers, the EPA offers a Training Verification Program
(TVP) that involves the issuance of training verification cards. The TVP is optional for states; a state that wants
to participate will submit an agreement form to the EPA and will request the number of verification cards it needs to
implement the program. While this does not place any additional burden on the states, the TVP does require trainers
to create and maintain records of rosters containing the names of the trainees. The upward revision in burden hours
requested in this ICR reflects these trainer requirements under the TVP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will use the additional information for verification purposes and to provide a mechanism to standardize
the worker pesticide safety training program across the agricultural industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The public burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 10 minutes per respondent to prepare
a roster, and 5 minutes per respondent to file a roster annually. This estimate includes the time to review instructions
and review the collection of information.

Ambient Air Monitoring Reference and Equivalent Methods; Equivalent Method Designation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that EPA, in accordance with 40 CFR part 53, has designated another equivalent method for the
determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collected from ambient air. The new designated method is identified
as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
EQL&hyph;0694&hyph;096, ``Determination of Lead Concentration in Ambient Particulate Matter by Inductively
Coupled Argon Plasma Optical Emission spectrometry (State of West Virginia).''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant's request for an equivalent method determination for the above method was received on March 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This method has been tested by the applicant, the State of West Virginia, in accordance with the test procedures prescribed
in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests, EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this
method should be designated as an equivalent method. The information submitted by the applicant will be kept on file
at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and
will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom
of Information Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This method uses the sampling procedure specified in the reference method for the determination of lead in suspended
particulate matter collected from ambient air (43 FR 46258). Lead in the particulate matter is solubilized by extraction
with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, facilitated by heat and ultrasonication. The lead content of
the sample is analyzed by a Thermo Jarrel Ash AtomScan 16 inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometer
using the 220.3 nm lead emission line and instrument conditions optimized by the user laboratory. Technical questions
concerning the method should be directed to the State of West Virginia, Department of Commerce, Labor and Environmental
Resources, Division of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality, 1558 Washington Street East, Charleston,
West Virginia 25311&hyph;2599.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use by states and other control agencies under requirements
of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must be used in strict accordance
with the procedures and specifications provided in the method description. States or other agencies using inductively
coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometric methods that employ procedures and specifications significantly
different from those in this method must seek approval for their particular method under the provisions of &sect;2.8
of Appendix C to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modification of Methods by Users) or may seek designation of such methods as equivalent
methods under the provisions of 40 CFR part 53.

Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 added Section 309(j) to the Communications Act of
1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Sections 151&hyph;713. Section 309(j) gives the Commission express authority to employ
competitive bidding procedures to choose among mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses. The Commission's
March 8, 1994 Second Report and Order established general rules and procedures and a broad menu of competitive bidding
methods to be used for all auctionable services. The Third Report and Order establishes service-specific rules for
competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded for Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband
PCS''). Generally, the Commission followed the payment and procedural rules adopted in the Second Report and Order
in conducting narrowband PCS auctions, but made minor changes to adjust the requirements to the characteristics
of the narrowband PCS service. In addition, procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service based
on part 22 of the Commission's rules were adopted. Applicants are required to file certain information so that the
Commission can determine whether the applicants are legally, technically and financially qualified to be licensed.
Affected public are any member of the public who wants to become a licensee.

Pub. L. 100&hyph;503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, amended the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.
552a) by adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. Section 7201 of
Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Amendments of 1990, further amended the Privacy
Act regarding protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching
by Federal agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, and local government
records. It requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Negotiate written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the match; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published
on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25532) contained two errors that are being corrected in this notice. The first correction concerns
the amount of funding available. The total amount listed as available, $14,881,000, is corrected to read $18,481,000.
The additional $3.6 million reflects the determination that $2 million to be used for the second year of two-year FY
1993 Private Enforcement Initiative awards, and $1.6 million to be used for the second year of two-year FY 1993 Fair
Housing Organizations Initiative awards, will be funded out of FY 1995 funds. This is because the second year of funding
is subject to not only the availability of funds, but to an annual performance review. The amounts of funding under
these two Initiatives are corrected accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For FY 1994, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1994 (approved October 28, 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;124), (94 App. Act) appropriated $20,481,000 for the FHIP
program. Of this amount, $2,000,000 of Private Enforcement Initiative funds will be made available for special projects
to be announced in a separate NOFA. The remaining $18,481,000 is being made available on a competitive basis to eligible
organizations that submit timely applications and are selected in response to this NOFA. The funding selections
will be made on the basis of criteria for eligibility, factors for award, and completeness of budget information.
The Department retains the right to shift funds between FHIP Initiatives, listed below, within statutorily prescribed
limitations. The amounts included in this NOFA are subject to change based on fund availability. The total amount
available under this NOFA will be divided among the four FHIP Initiatives as follows:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Eugene District, Bureau of Land Management, hereby establishes supplementary rules for use of those public lands
included in the Row River Trail and adjoining facilities in the South Valley Resource Area, Eugene District, Lane
County, Oregon. These supplementary rules are intended to protect public land facilities and provide for public
safety for the Row River Trail, a rails-to-trails conversion project near the city of Cottage Grove, Oregon. The BLM
is accepting the donation of the former railroad as a non-motorized trail from Willamette Industries, Inc., as partial
settlement of a debt owed to the United States. Upon acceptance of the trail and associated properties by the United
States, the donated land will be available for public use. These rules are designed to reduce the potential for damage
to the trail by unauthorized motor vehicle traffic and to enhance the safety of trail visitors and neighboring residents.
A ``Notice of proposed establishment of supplementary rules'' was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19204) and provided for a thirty day comment period that ended May 23, 1994. Four letters were
received, containing two substantive comments. One comment objected to the prohibition against the possession
of firearms on the trail. The writer felt that a prohibition against discharge of firearms would be sufficient and
that visitors should be allowed to carry firearms for self-defense. It was decided to retain the restriction against
weapons, including firearms, to reduce the potential for misunderstanding of rules by trail users and to help protect
people both on and off the trail from accidental injury. Another comment objected to the prohibition against motorized
vehicles on the grounds that this would exclude disabled visitors from using all-terrain vehicles or motorized wheelchairs
on the trail. The rule does allow use of motorized vehicles authorized by BLM, which could include disabled visitor's
motorized wheelchairs or specialty all-terrain vehicles on a case-by-case basis. Each situation would need to be
evaluated with regard to the potential for such use to damage the trail or the surrounding environment.

The Service must determine that the criteria identified in section 10(a)(2)(B) of the Act have been met in order to
issue an incidental take permit under section 10(a)(2)(B). The criteria are: (1) The taking will be incidental; (2)
the applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize and mitigate the impacts of taking; (3) the applicant
will ensure that adequate funding for the plan will be provided and procedures are available to deal with unforeseen
circumstances; (4) the taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species
in the wild; and (5) other measures which may be necessary, if any, are met. The public is invited to comment on the applicability
of those criteria to this permit application.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing conflicts among federally protected species and urban development have prompted City of Bakersfield (City)
and County of Kern (County) to pursue an HCP and incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act.
The HCP is designed to offset impacts resulting from loss of habitat incurred through land use development activities
in the Metropolitan Bakersfield area. The goal of the HCP is to acquire, preserve, and enhance native habitats which
support endangered and threatened species and other species of concern, while allowing urban development to proceed
within the Metropolitan Bakersfield area. The area covered by the HCP contains land within the jurisdiction of the
City and County. The HCP is the product of a 7-year planning process involving the city, county, representatives of
the environmental community and the building industry, and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP will result in incidental take of several endangered and threatened species within the 408-square mile area
of Metropolitan Bakersfield. The Federal permit would make this take lawful so long as it is in accordance with the
conditions of the permit as described in the HCP and its IA. The permit issued would cover the species formally listed
by the Service at the time of issuance. Other species of concern could be added by amendment in the event that they are
subsequently listed as an endangered species or threatened species. The section 10(a)(1)(B) permit would permit
the incidental take of the following listed species: San Joaquin kit fox, blunt-nosed leopard lizard, Tipton kangaroo
rat, and giant kangaroo rat.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HCP addresses the following species of concern and listed plants, in addition to the federally protected species
which will be covered by the plan: Short-nosed kangaroo rat, San Joaquin antelope squirrel, San Joaquin pocket mouse,
Bakersfield saltbush, Slough thistle, recurved larkspur, Tulare pseudobahia, striped adobe lily, Bakersfield
cactus, California jewel flower, San Joaquin wooly-threads, Hoover's wooly-star and Kern mallow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The federally listed species are scattered generally throughout the open, non-urbanized lands of the Metropolitan
Bakersfield area. According to biological surveys conducted for the HCP and surveys conducted by others since 1980,
several of the species of concern may no longer occur in the area. the San Joaquin kit fox is the most widespread of the
species of concern and is most frequently affected by urbanization in the HCP area. High potential for impact and the
need for large preserves make the kit for a natural focus for the HCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the area is in intensive agriculture, but retains value for kit fox in prey and even for dens in berms, near water
impoundments, and on fallow land. Urbanization of agricultural land will result in a take of species, loss of habitat,
and intensification of population related take (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
road kills). The natural lands of the area have greater species value and represent more viable long-term habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP describes a method of collecting funds for the acquisition and/or enhancement of natural lands and restorable
lands for purpsoes of preserves. Areas targeted for acquisition have been identified for conservation by the Service
and CDFG as part of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Biological Framework for Natural Lands and Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the southern San Joaquin Valley. The HCP also provided for the minimization of take within the developed area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP addresses two categories of land: (1) Natural land, meaning land generally in grazing and with original soil
and topography intact, and (2) open land, which includes natural land as well as agriculture and all other non-urban
land in the area. Urbanization of either category would pay the same mitigation fee, but the two are distinguished
for the purposes of environmental assessment and permit monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP provides for: 1. Acquisition and management of a minimum of 3 acres of significant value endangered species
habitat for every 1 acre of ``natural'' land developed within the HCP area, or acquisition and management of 1 acre
of significant value endangered species habitat for every 1 acre of ``open'' land developed within the HCP area, whichever
is greater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Land acquisition outside of the HCP area with consideration to pre-approved acquisition areas identified by CDFG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Acquisition and management of between 500 and 1,000 acres of land in the northeast portion of the study area for the
primary purpose of preserving the Bakersfield cactus.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Acquisition and management of land, as feasible, adjacent to the Kern Water Bank project on the west side of I&hyph;5,
south of Panama Lane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Pursuit of cooperative agreements for restoring and enhancing land, as feasible, within the Kern Water Bank project
area and provide funding as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Limited relocation or displacement of individuals in areas affected by development as a means of reducing direct
take of endangered species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HCP will be implemented under the terms of the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit issued by the Service and the IA. The permit
is requested for a period of 20 years, or until urban development permits are issued for 15,200 acres of natural lands
or 43,000 acres of open lands. The HCP has three categories of participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Service as a permitter and advisor to the Implementation Trust (Trust);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. City and County as permittees and trustees; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Other implementing entities such as The Nature Conservancy and CDFG as preserve development coordinators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City and County will be the primary entities responsible for administering the institutional elements of the
HCP in their respective jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration of the HCP involves the following categories: (1) Local mitigation fee collection and fund management,
(2) management of State and Federal funding, if applicable, (3) preserve selection and acquisition, (4) preserve
management, (5) land restoration and enhancement and species monitoring, (6) annual report and preparation, and
(7) enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP program relies on the formation of a Trust which would be in charge of making major preserve acquisition decisions
and for administering the plan. The Trust will comprise representatives from the City and County as trustees, the
Service, CDFG, and a member of the public as mandatory advisors. Specific preserve management plans would be developed
later and carried out by each individual preserve management entity. The mitigation funds collected by the City and
County will be deposited into a trust fund and would be administered by the Trust. The Trust will meet as necessary to
carry out the HCP. The Trust will be responsible for reporting to the Service as to the status of enhancement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP program will be funded through the collection of a one time mitigation fee paid on all new construction taking
place within the conservation plan area. The fee is $1,240 per gross acre for all new construction on previously undeveloped
land, payable at the time building permits are issued. The fee is set in 1993 dollars and will be adjusted annually for
inflation. Upon payment of this fee and receipt of City or County project approval, a development permit applicant
would become a sub-permittee and would be allowed the incidental take of species in accordance with Federal endangered
species laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee is based on per acre estimated costs of, (1) $600 for land, (2) $100 for fencing and improvement, (3) $300 for
management and enhancement, and (4) $250 for program administration. The amount of mitigation fees collected will
depend on the rate of growth in the HCP area. At current growth rates, fees will generate funding for acquisition and
management or roughly 700 acres per year. State and Federal conservation funds will be sought to augment local funds
for land acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP applies to the entire conservation plan area (2010 General Plan), but the requested section 10(a)(1)(B) permit
would only allow take in the area outside of the primary flood plain of the Kern River and lands within the Kern Water
Bank. The Kern River is excluded to assure that an open corridor can be maintained between the foothills to the northeast
and the San Joaquin Hills Valley floor to the west. Kern Water Bank lands are under the jurisdiction of the State of California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCP addresses lands converted primarily to urban uses as permitted by the City or County. Activities which may
result in a take, but which are not subject to approval by the City or County, will not be authorized by the proposed permit.
Thus, impact on natural lands from oil extraction or agriculture are not subject to the permit, although some types
of ancillary oil and agricultural facilities that are subject to City or County permits would be covered. Activities
not covered by the permit would have to comply separately with Federal requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the permit covers a large area, the take of threatened or endangered species will only occur where actual
urban growth occurs. The area designated for urban uses (including all low density residential categories) in the
2010 General Plan covers roughly 74.5 square miles (47,600 acres) of undeveloped or open land. Of this, 22.25 square
miles (14,200) acres is natural land, which currently supports populations of the species of concern, and 52.25 square
miles (33,400 acres) of other open lands, primarily intensive agriculture. Full build-out of the 2010 General Plan
would double the size of Bakersfield, but full build-out is not expected to occur within the proposed 20-year life
of the permit. Realistic projections indicate a loss of open lands at a rate of roughly 1 square miles per year, which
is assumed to be divided proportionately between natural and other open lands. At that rate, a loss of some 20 square
miles of open land, including some 7 square miles of natural land, will take place over the life of the permit. Even though
actual growth and impact may vary, the mitigation program is designed to be self-regulating, even a major increase
in growth could be accommodated by the proposed HCP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual extent and location of Metropolitan Bakersfield growth cannot be exactly predicted, and the HCP must therefore
rely on the ongoing preservation actions of the Trust. Permit compliance will be met by maintaining adequate enhancement
levels. There are two tests that the Trust must meet: (1) 1 acre of enhancement for each acre of open land urbanized,
or (2) 3 acres enhanced for each acre of natural land urbanized, whichever is greater. The accounting will be done quarterly
and annually, but will reflect cumulative urbanization commencing at the beginning of the permit period. Management
plans for habitat areas will require approval from the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA examines a range of alternatives pertaining to preserve strategy. The no-action alternative, meaning that
the City and County would not obtain a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit, would leave much of the Metropolitan Bakersfield
area in conflict with the Act and potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties. The Service could only enforce
the Act on a case-by-case basis and significant impact on endangered species could still occur through piece meal
reduction of habitat, cumulative indirect impact of growth, and lack of enhancement to offset past impacts. No action
would lead to significant impairment of growth in Metropolitan Bakersfield, along with gradual, significant deterioration
in the status of endangered species. Other alternatives examined include five other preserve strategies and mandatory
relocation as additional mitigation.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for endangered and threatened fishes of the Rio Yaqui. Four species are included in the recovery plan: Yaqui catfish
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Ictalurus pricei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), and beautiful shiner (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cyprinella formosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), both listed by the Service as threatened species on August 31, 1984 (49 FR 34494); Yaqui chub (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Gila purpurea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), listed by the Service as endangered on August 31, 1984 (49 FR 34494); and Yaqui topminnow (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Poeciliopsis occidentalis sonoriensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), listed by the Service as endangered on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001). Historically, the headwaters of the Rio Yaqui
that occur in the United States may not have provided sufficient habitat for large populations of the Yaqui catfish,
however the other three species were widely distributed throughout the upper reaches of the Rio Yaqui system. Loss
of habitat, plus competition and predation from nonnative fish threaten the continued survival of these fish within
the United States. The Service solicits review and comments from the public on this draft plan.

Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site-specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote conservation of a
particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan preparation. The Service considers all information during
a public comment prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies also
take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loss of habitat and competition with, and or predations from, nonnative fish are threats to the continued survival
of the listed fish of the Rio Yaqui. In addition, the Yaqui catfish hybridizes with channel catfish (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ictalurus punctatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) thereby encountering an additional threat. The recovery plan addresses protection of existing populations, restoration
of depleted populations, and protection and restoration of habitat as elements that must be achieved if the species
is to survive in the wild. The recovery plan also recognizes the need to work with Mexican Government and Mexican biologists
to conserve habitat and fish populations that occur in Mexico. Expansion of these species into historic habitat in
Mexico will need to be accomplished before delisting of these species can occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan will be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment

The Act of October 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2532, 2533, 16 U.S.C. 460 u&hyph;19, following notice to Congress as provided
therein, which has been satisfied, authorizes the United States to accept title to any lands, or interests in lands,
located outside the boundaries of the Lakeshore which any private person, organization, or public or private corporation
may offer to donate to the United States, if the Secretary finds that such lands would make a significant contribution
to the purposes for which the Lakeshore was established; and he shall administer such lands as part of the Lakeshore
following this publication. Landsource, Inc. on behalf of Midwest Division of National Steel Corporation, has offered
to donate 51.47 acres of land for incorporation into the Lakeshore. The tract of land being donated is in Porter County,
Indiana. The lands are principally composed of oak savannah of a similar composition to the Inland Marsh unit of the
Lakeshore which it adjoins. It includes significant habitat for the federally listed endangered Karner Blue Butterfly.
The tract also affords recreational opportunities for the visiting public. It is considered that the recreational
opportunities offered by this property, along with the biological resources on this 51.47 acres, will make a significant
contribution to the Lakeshore. The specific lands proposed for addition are described as follows:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By decision served November 4, 1993 in this proceeding, the Commission granted, subject to environmental review,
Vaughan Railroad Company's petition for exemption from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10901 for the construction
and operation over two railroad segments_a 8.8 mile railroad extension and a 0.4 mile connecting track in Nicholas
and Fayette Counties, West Virginia. The effective date of the decision was postponed until completion of the Commission's
environmental review and further decision. The Commission has prepared its environmental assessment which concludes
that the proposed action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation
of energy resources. The Commission will consider any comments to the conclusions reached in the environmental assessment
before rendering a final decision in this proceeding.

Under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1254a) (``the Act''), the Attorney
General is authorized to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States to eligible nationals of designated
foreign states, or to eligible aliens who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in a designated state,
upon a finding that such states are experiencing ongoing civil strife, environmental disaster, or certain other
extraordinary and temporary conditions. This notice by the Attorney General designates Rwanda pursuant to section
244A(b) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By the authority vested in me as Attorney General under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended,
(8 U.S.C. 1254a), I find, after consultation with the appropriate agencies of the Government, that: (a) There exists
an ongoing armed conflict in Rwanda and that a return of aliens who are nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality
who last habitually resided in Rwanda, would pose a serious threat to their personal safety as a result of the armed
conflict in that nation; (b) there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in Rwanda that prevent aliens who
are nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, from returning to
Rwanda in safety; and (c) permitting nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided
in Rwanda, to remain temporarily in the United States is not contrary to the national interest of the United States.
Accordingly, it is ordered as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rwanda is designated under section 244A(b) of the Act. Nationals of Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who
last habitually resided in Rwanda, and who have been ``continuously physically present'' and have ``continuously
resided in the United States'' since June 7, 1994 may apply for Temporary Protected Status within the registration
period which begins on June 7, 1994 and ends on June 6, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) I estimate that there are no more than 500 nationals of Rwanda and aliens having no nationality who last habitually
resided in Rwanda, who are currently in nonimmigrant or unlawful status, eligible for Temporary Protected Status.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except as specifically provided in this notice, applications for Temporary Protected Status by nationals of
Rwanda, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Rwanda, must be filed pursuant to the provisions
of 8 CFR part 240. Aliens who wish to apply for TPS must file an Application for Temporary Protected Status, Form I&hyph;821,
together with an Application for Employment Authorization, Form I&hyph;765, during the registration period, which
begins on June 7, 1994 and will remain in effect until June 6, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A fee of fifty dollars ($50) will be charged for each Application for Temporary Protected Status, Form I&hyph;821,
filed during the registration period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), now set at sixty dollars ($60), will be charged for each Application for
Employment Authorization, Form I&hyph;765, filed by an alien requesting employment authorization. An alien who
does not seek employment authorization must nevertheless file Form I&hyph;765, together with Form I&hyph;821,
for informational purposes, but in such cases Form I&hyph;765 will be without fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Pursuant to section 244A(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Attorney General will review, at least 60 days before June 6,
1995 the designation of Rwanda under the Temporary Protected Status program to determine whether the conditions
for designation continue to exist. Notice of that determination, including the basis for the determination, will

II. Facts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant operates a commercial storage and chemical-waste landfill facility for disposal of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs). Transformers and other articles containing PCBs received at the facility must be drained and flushed,
and the flushed liquid placed into storage tanks. According to the applicant, two of its employees drain transformers
containing PCB-contaminated oil into one of the two 10,000-gallon outside tanks. The transformers then are filled
with diesel fuel and allowed to sit approximately 18 hours. The diesel fuel subsequently is drained into one of the
two outside tanks previously mentioned. It is during this draining and flushing operation that the filling and emptying
connections controlled under the subject standard are made and broken. These draining and flushing operations occur
within the processing and storage building, as opposed to outside the building as required by the standard. As a result
of these draining and flushing operations, a conflict exists between OSHA's requirement 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(viii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements specified under 40 CFR 761.65(b)(1) concerning the draining
and flushing of combustible/flammable liquids. Specifically, the EPA requires that processing and storage facilities
for PCBs be located inside enclosed structures to avoid exposure to weather, with specially-designed steel floors
to properly drain spills, while OSHA requires that transfer of combustible/flammable liquids_diesel fuel in this
case_be accomplished outside enclosed structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outside storage tanks used to store the flushed liquid are provided with a continuously-welded steel secondary containment
unit that is 30 feet in diameter and 3 feet, 6 inches high. The tanks also are placed on 2-inch x 1/14-inch heavy-duty
welded steel grating to allow immediate identification of any leaks from the tank bottom. The secondary containment
structure has the capacity to hold 100 percent of the volume of the largest tank within its perimeter plus the volume
of water that would be added from a 24-hour rainfall totalling 1.75 inches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Auxiliary equipment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, pumps and pipelines systems serving the tanks) also is above ground and subject to daily visual inspections. All
pumps and disconnect units are within the processing/storage building (the ``processing building''), which has
a welded steel floor for containment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For security purposes, the facility is located within a fenced, controlled area. The main entry gate to the facility
is open during operating hours; during these hours, a security officer is posted at this gate to preclude unauthorized
entry. During nonoperating hours, the main entry gate is locked and a security officer is posted at this gate; this
security officer also makes periodic patrols of the facility during nonoperating hours. The remaining six gates
to the facility are normally locked with a key lock during both operating and nonoperating hours; keys to these locks
are contained in a sealed (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``break'') box next to each of these gates. During emergency events (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fire or explosion), evacuees will break the seals to these boxes, remove the keys, and unlock the gates to effect emergency
egress from the facility. Access to the tank area is controlled, and only authorized personnel are permitted to enter
the area. The tanks (including tank valves and connections), associated equipment building, and surrounding area
are inspected by designated inspector/supervisors for spills, structural integrity/damage, proper grounding,
the presence of sparks and open flames/other ignition sources, accessibility and proper space segregation between
tanks, and notation of liquids in the tanks; these inspection procedures are required as part of the facility's Operating
Permit issued by the EPA. These inspections are conducted daily during regular operating periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of complying with the standard, the applicant contends that specific safety procedures and engineering
provisions used during the draining and flushing operations will provide protection equal to, or better than, the
standard. These procedures and provisions are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Operators are supervised during the transfer of PCBs or ignitable materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Waste-handling (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 draining and flushing) areas are clearly marked with warning signs and routinely inspected (at least once daily during
regular operating periods) by designated inspectors/supervisors to assure that hazardous concentrations of vapors
generated by combustible/flammable liquids are not permitted to accumulate in a waste-handling area when ignition
sources are present. No meters are used to monitor diesel fuel vapors in waste-handling areas because the vapor pressure
of diesel fuel (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 0.4 mm Hg @ 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) is too low to register on commercially-available gas meters or the photometric meters (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HNu units) used normally to monitor volatile vapors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Smoking is prohibited inside the processing building.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Hot work permits are required prior to any activity that may generate a source of ignition. Draining and flushing
operations do not take place when a work permit is issued for repairs in the processing area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. During loading/unloading operations, transportation vehicles containing ignitable substances are secured
to prevent movement, and grounded to reduce the potential for static discharge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No ignitable wastes are processed in uncontrolled areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. All pumps, hoses, and connections are checked by system operators for leaks and ruptures prior to operation, and
at least once daily during regular operating hours by designated inspectors/supervisors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Direct ventilation is provided during these draining and flushing operations by a wall-mounted exhaust fan located
adjacent to the processing area. This fan circulates air at 12,000 cubic feet per minute (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 18 air changes per hour), thereby preventing accumulation of diesel fuel vapors inside the building.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The processing building is ventilated by roof-mounted turbine vents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. All tanks containing ignitable wastes meet American Society for Testing and Materials specifications for ignitables,
and are grounded to prevent sparking and potential ignition. For these tanks, discharge valves are fitted with fusible
links that close in case of a fire emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Procedures have been established to minimize, contain, and expeditiously remove any liquid spills (containing
PCBs, ignitable liquids, or combinations thereof) that may occur within the facility. In addition, daily inspections
for spills are conducted during regular operating periods by designated inspectors/supervisors (including monitoring
tank volumes for undocumented reductions); all hoses, connections, and valves are inspected by systems operators
prior to initiating an operation. Leaking drums are placed in overpack drums. The processing system is provided with
a series of interlocks to prevent liquid spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spill-removal procedures vary according to the size of the spill. If the spill is small, the hazardous liquid should
be removed using designated sorbents and containers available in the processing area. During removal, the following
safety precautions must be observed: Contact with the spilled material is to be avoided; unnecessary personnel must
leave the area; protective equipment (descibed below in paragraph 14) must be worn; the area must be ventilated; personnel
and equipment must be decontaminated thoroughly following exposure (eyewashes and bodywashes are available in
the processing area for this purpose); and technical advice should be sought if necessary. Large spills should be
contained using diking materials available in the processing areas. Safety precautions prescribed for controlling
small spills should be used in large-spill situations as well. Where there is a high potential for spills, work is performed
within diked or curbed areas. If the spilled material escapes, downstream authorities must be notified. A detailed
Contingency Plan for managing spills may be obtained from Envirosafe at the address listed above in the first paragraph
under I. Background. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The storage tank volume is checked prior to pumping ignitable liquids into the tank to assure that there is adequate
volume to receive these liquids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Tanks are checked to assure that the proper tanks are being filled with flushed liquid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Personnel involved in draining and flushing operations receive specific, documented training for conducting
these operations as prescribed by appendix 3 (``Training Plan/section 17, PCB Personnel Training Program''), volume
I of the EPA's ``Final Approval for Disposal and Commercial Storage of Polychlorinated Biphenyls'' (hereafter,
the ``EPA approval document''). This training includes emergency procedures for the general workforce (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recognizing alarms, notifying designated authorities of the emergency, egressing from the facility), and specialized
training for members of the fire bridgade in controlling and suppressing explosions/fires. (Members of the fire
brigade are volunteers from among Envirosafe's local employees; these employees leave their regular jobs to respond
to emergencies.) The EPA issued this approval document under Permit Number IDD073114654, September 20, 1991. Copies
of training plans, including training plans for emergency procedures used by the general workforce and the fire brigade,
may be obtained from Envirosafe at the address listed above in the first paragraph under I. Background.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During emergency events involving PCB contamination, emergency personnel are required to wear chemical-protective
clothing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, polyethylene-coated coveralls, pvc or composite-rubber gloves, and full-face, fitted respirators).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every employee at the facility has access to either the internal telephone system or a two-way radio that can be used
to communicate the occurrence of a fire or explosion to the Emergency Coordinator located in the supervisor's trailer
at the north end of the facility site. The Emergency Coordinator determines the correct emergency response, and initiates
this emergency response by manually activating the appropriate combination of falcon horns, sirens, and/or alarm
horn/strobe-light sets. Using predetermined routes, all nonessential employees are evacuated from the immediate
fire/explosion area to designated assembly areas outside the facility gates. Only authorized (and predesignated)
employees are allowed to remain in the fire/explosion area. During regular operating hours, the fire brigade is available
onsite to control the emergency event. During nonoperating hours, the employee who discovers the emergency, usually
the security officer, notifies the Emergency Coordinator; after determining the appropriate response, the Emergency
Coordinator telephones members of the fire brigade at their homes and directs them to report to the Envirosafe facility.
After the emergency event has been controlled, the decision to reenter the facility can be made only by the Emergency
Coordinator; prior to reentry, a tally is made of employees, contract personnel, and visitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All employees receive emergency training drills semi-annually, during which they practice emergency evacuations.
If a power outage occurs during an emergency event, emergency equipment requiring electricity can be operated either
through batteries (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, two-way radios) or auxiliary power. Copies of the Emergency Evacuation Plan covering these activities may be obtained
from Envirosafe at the address listed above in the first paragraph under ``I. Background.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. To respond to serious emergency events (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, fires and explosions), a fire brigade consisting of specially-trained Envirosafe employees is available during
operating hours. Pursuant to the Training Plan mentioned in the preceding section, members of the fire brigade are
trained not only in fire brigade procedures and safety, but in first aid and CPR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every employee at the facility receives the following onsite emergency training: Procedures for locating, using,
inspecting, repairing, and replacing facility emergency and monitoring equipment; emergency communication procedures
and alarm system operation; proper responses to fires, explosions, and spill incidents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, procedures for containing, controlling, and mitigating spills); and evacuation procedures. At least two employees
on duty during regular operating hours are trained in first-aid and CPR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in Table G&hyph;4 of Appendix 5 to the EPA approval document, the fire brigade is trained to use dry chemicals
or carbon dioxide on small fires, and standard firefighting agents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, foam and high-pressure water) on large fires. The fire brigade is available at the facility during normal operating
hours (and on standby status at home during nonoperating hours), and is equipped with a fire truck carrying a foam unit,
high-pressure water applicator, and water supply. A storage tank has been installed at the facility to supply a maximum
of 16,000 gallons of water during fire emergencies. Employees in the processing building are trained to operate Class
ABC 20-pound fire extinguishers, while members of the fire brigade also are trained in the use of 125-pound Class BC
fire extinguishers located outside this building.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant states that it is providing its employees with employment and a place of employment at least as safe and
healthful as required by 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

III. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant has requested from OSHA a variance from the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This standard requires that filling and emptying connections that are made and broken during the transfer of combustible/flammable
liquids shall be located outside the buildings at a location free from any source of ignition and not less than 5 feet
away from any building opening. Such connection shall be closed and liquid-tight when not in use. The connection shall
be properly identified. This standard assures worker safety by preventing fires and explosions that may occur during
transfer operations involving combustible/flammable liquids. This purpose is accomplished by: Providing sufficient
ventilation at combustible/flammable liquid transfer sites to prevent concentrations of vapor-air mixtures (resulting
from spilled liquids) from exceeding one-fourth of the lower flammable limit defined under 29 CFR 1910.106(a)(31);
and prohibiting sources at the transfer sites that could ignite these vapor-air mixtures. Due to a conflict between
the OSHA and EPA standards, as discussed above under section II, the applicant's filling and emptying connections
are made and broken inside the building compared to outside the building as required under the OSHA standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure maximum employee protection during flushing and draining operations, the applicant has implemented specific
procedures to assure that the above OSHA standard will be met or exceeded. These procedures include: Providing supervision
of employees during the transfer of PCBs or ignitable materials; inspecting draining and flushing areas daily to
assure that ignition sources are not present; forbidding waste-handling operations that may generate sources of
ignitions from occurring when hot work permits are issued for repairs; prohibiting smoking in the process building;
providing a large-capacity fan and several roof-mounted turbine vents to prevent the accumulation of diesel fuel
vapors inside the building; securing and grounding transportation vehicles to prevent movement and potential static
discharge; minimizing, containing, and expeditiously removing any PCB ignitable liquids spills; continuously
inspecting drums, hoses, and connections; wearing appropriate protective clothing and respirators when controlling
liquid spills; and training general employees and inhouse fire brigade personnel in pertinent emergency procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that the applicant, by using the above-mentioned operational procedures and engineering techniques,
will provide employment and a place of employment as safe and healthful as required under 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in preventing the accumulation of hazardous vapors generated from combustible/flammable liquids used in its processing
operations, and controlling ignition sources at the transfer sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in the event of a fire or an explosion, every employee at the facility can notify the Emergency Coordinator
by either the internal telephone system or a two-way radio. Upon notification of a fire or explosion, the Emergency
Coordinator manually activates the appropriate alarms. All employees, except trained fire brigade members, are
evacuated. This emergency training program conforms with OSHA's policy to allow fire brigades under conditions
in which training, organization, and planning are adequate to assure employee safety and health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the variance application and supporting data, OSHA has determined that the specific safety procedures
used by the applicant during the draining and flushing operations will provide employee protection equal to, or better
than, the level of protection required under 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Therefore, based on the record discussed above, OSHA finds that compliance with the terms of the Order set out below
will provide employment, and a place of employment, that are as safe and healthful as would be provided if the applicant
complied with 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

IV. Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 6(d) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90
(55 FR 9033), and 29 CFR part 1905, it is ordered that Envirosafe Services, Inc., is authorized to implement the following

Commonwealth is the corporate successor to Martin-Marietta Aluminum of Kentucky, Inc. On or about September 3, 1982,
defendant, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, United States Department of Labor (``OFCCP'') filed
an administrative complaint against Commonwealth alleging that Commonwealth had violated provisions of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 793, et seq., and the regulations promulgated thereunder, in connection with its
hiring practices at its aluminum plant in Lewisport, Hancock County, Kentucky.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the close of pleadings and discovery, the issues raised by the Administrative Complaint were tried before Administrative
Law Judge Daniel J. Roketenetz on June 24, 1985 through June 27, 1985. Judge Roketenetz issued a Recommended Decision
and Order on June 26, 1986. In his Recommended Decision and Order, Administrative Law Judge Roketenetz recommended
dismissal of OFCCP's Administrative Complaint in its entirety. OFCCP took exception to the Recommended Decision
and Order of Administrative Law Judge Roketenetz. The parties briefed the exceptions to the Assistant Secretary
for Employment Standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards, United States Department of Labor, issued a Final Decision
and Order in Case No. 82&hyph;OFC&hyph;6 on or about February 10, 1994. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Employment
Standards has ruled that Commonwealth violated &sect;503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Concomitantly, the
Acting Assistant Secretary has ordered that Commonwealth give five of the complainants in the proceedings offers
of employment within sixty days of Commonwealth's receipt of the Order, and has ordered retroactive seniority and
other benefits. In addition, the Acting Assistant Secretary has ordered that Commonwealth will be ineligible for
the award of any government contracts or subcontracts and will be ineligible for extensions or other modifications
of any existing government contracts or subcontracts if it does not comply with the other components of his Order.

Commonwealth owns and operates and aluminum plant located near Lewisport in Hancock County, Kentucky. The plaintiff
produces aluminum in sheet form which it sells and distributes to various customers. Employees who work in production
and maintenance are members of the Local 7325, United Steel Workers of America and are hourly personnel. All complainants
involved herein sought jobs in the production or maintenance area within the plant. Between 1980 and today, Commonwealth
has had government contracts with a total value of $4,500,622.48. Commonwealth has had no direct government contracts
since 1990. Commonwealth has one government subcontract which, when fulfilled, will have a total value of $4,805,129.40.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OFCCP debarred Commonwealth as a government contractor and on April 29, 1994, OFCCP published a notice of Commonwealth's
debarment in the Federal Register. Such debarment notice appears at 59 Federal Register 22178.

The parties have advised the Court of the balancing factors under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Celebrezze
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case and several other Sixth Circuit cases with respect to temporary injunctions. The factors are: Likelihood of
success, irreparable harm, public interest and looking at the harm to everyone. The Court will address each of those,
albeit fairly briefly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the likelihood of success, the Court does not believe that there can be an automatic knee jerk reaction
in every case where the Department of Labor reverses the ALJ. The Court understand that, at this stage, its responsibility
is to facially address the merits. However, the mere reversal of an Administrative Law Judge alone is not necessarily
enough. Nonetheless, the Administrative Law judge has had the opportunity to see the witnesses, review documents,
and measure credibility. In this particular case, Commonwealth has shown a likelihood of success because it has already
won once in front of an Administrative Law Judge and in light of the other factors which the Court will address. The Court
does not credit the concern of the plaintiffs that there has not been any allegation that the individual complainants
would have been employed to do government contract work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of irreparable harm is the most intriguing for the Court. The Court has done its own research in addition to
the research furnished by the parties. There are no controlling cases. Several are persuasive, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Marshall, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23 FEP Cases 527 (E.D. Tex 1980), that debarment constitutes irreparable harm. The Court disagrees with that conclusion.
In the Court's opinion, the proper analysis is to examine the harm of compliance and not the harm of non-compliance.
There are several reasons for the Court's conclusion. One reason is that there are cases that are persuasive and while
not exactly on point, indicate that the courts in various factual settings were looking to the cost of compliance rather
than the cost of non-compliance. Those cases are

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Petroleum Exploration, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the petroleum company argued that it was being forced to choose between complying with an agency order on the one hand,
which would require a high expenditure of money, or on the other hand non-compliance, which would subject it to harsh
penalties. In that particular situation, the Supreme Court states ``the necessity to expend for the investigation
or to take the risk for non-compliance does not justify the injunction. It is not the sort of irreparable injury against
which equity protects.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1994. U.S. App., Lexis 6813, April 8, 1994. In that particular case, the district court assessed the threat of irreparable
injury based on compliance rather than on non-compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court also finds persuasive the case that was cited on the day of the temporary restraining order hearing, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Uniroyal, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marshall, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20 FEP cases 446 (D.C. Cir. 1979). While 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Uniroyal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
does not explicitly state the standard, the Court of Appeals clearly considered the cost of avoiding debarment and
not the cost that would be due to the debarment itself. In this Court's opinion, explicit in the balancing test is the
rule that you consider the cost of compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the foregoing cases are persuasive and are one reason the Court believes that the proper measure is the cost of
compliance with the Department of Labor's ruling. The principal reason the Court is considering cost of compliance
as the measure of harm is that this Court should not encourage non-compliance with the Department of Labor order. There
cannot be an automatic reaction in every case where an order of debarment has issued or is about to issue. If debarment
constituted irreparable harm, every debarment could be enjoined and the Court does not believe that is a good rationale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court notes that the meaning of the order is less than clear and this is reinforced by the footnotes addressing the
meaning of the order which appear in the defendants' response and plaintiff's reply filed herein. In that connection,
the Court found persuasive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wisconsin Gas Co. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
F.E.R.C., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985), cited by both parties, which held that the proper focus is upon 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
recoverable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
monetary loss. In this case, plaintiffs cannot sue the government or the individuals so in the Court's opinion, there
would be no recoverable monetary loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court noted to the parties that if OFCCP agreed that Commonwealth must only offer the next available job and if the
Department of Labor or if OFCCP agreed that Commonwealth could withdraw those offers, or if they had already become
full blown employment situations, if the OFCCP would agree that those employees could be let go if Commonwealth won
here, then there would not be an irreparable harm because you would have the Uniroyal situation. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Uniroyal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the D.C. Circuit ruled that once the documents requested were produced, if Uniroyal won on the appeal, the documents
would be returned and stricken from the record. In that connection, the Court is attempting to create a Uniroyal situation
here, if it exists, so that in this particular situation there would not be any irreparable harm.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Court's request that the parties confer, OFCCP placed on the record herein the statement that such
are precisely the terms presented to Commonwealth. In contrast, Commonwealth asserts that even such an arrangement
does not protect it from liability to the individual employees. This exchange, which occurred after the Court announced
its decision, persuades the Court that Commonwealth is irreparably harmed, since OFCCP lacks the requisite ability
to shield Commonwealth from all liability in the event Commonwealth extends offers of employment and later succeeds
here. These facts, therefore, are not parallel to those which existed in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Uniroyal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Going on to the third element, public interest, and the fourth, harm to others. The Court has heard testimony concerning
Commonwealth being a new company with a different approach. The Court has also heard testimony concerning administrative
delay. There is a legitimate public interest in wanting employers to offer employment opportunities to everyone
regardless of disability, regardless of age, gender, race, all of those factors. If this heightens the public interest,
then it also heightens the government's responsibility. If there is a high government responsibility, then waiting
seven or eight years to render an opinion frustrates the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. In the Court's opinion,
the government has acted, if not unconscionably, perhaps unfairly. Therefore, in the Court's opinion, the public
interest_if it does swing over to the side of the government at the outset_swings back because of the administrative
delay that has occurred here. Whether this case is considered on an expedited basis or not, there is no further harm
to the government. There is some value in the employer being able to rely on its understanding that at some point a proceeding
is ended. It is not reasonable to wait seven years and come in and do something and then expect immediate compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As far as harm to any third parties, the employees who are still in the work force are working now. To the extent that Commonwealth
should lose this case on its merits, those employees can gain monetary relief, and that will be satisfactory. The Court
will not hear a claim about the public agency's harm to it because of the delay that has been involved here.

<DOCTITLE>Draft Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a draft of a new guide planned for its Regulatory Guide
Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable
to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in
evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications
for permits and licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft guide is temporarily identified as DG&hyph;6002, ``Establishing Quality Assurance Programs for the Manufacture
and Distribution of Sealed Sources and Devices Containing Byproduct Material,'' and is intended for Division 6,
``Products.'' DG&hyph;6002 is being developed to provide guidance acceptable to the NRC staff on the essential elements
needed to develop, establish, and maintain a quality assurance program for the manufacture and distribution of sealed
sources and devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position
in this area. The draft guide has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are being solicited on the guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written comments
may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services,
Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of comments received
may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Comments will be most helpful if
received by August 12, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a time limit is given for comments on this draft guide, comments and suggestions in connection with items
for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory guides are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC. Requests for single copies of draft guides (which may be reproduced) or for placement on an automatic distribution
list for single copies of future draft guides in specific divisions should be made in writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Distribution and Mail Services Section. Telephone requests cannot
be accommodated. Regulatory guides are not copyrighted, and Commission approval is not required to reproduce them.

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No
Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;21 issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO) for operation of Millstone Nuclear Power
Station, Unit 1, located in New London County, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment adds a new section to Technical Specification Section 6.17 and would require that procedures
be in place to provide for monitoring and sampling of emergency service water (ESW) discharge flow during accident
conditions when a positive differential pressure cannot be maintained between ESW and low pressure coolant injection
(LPCI) in the LPCI heat exchangers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NNECO has reviewed the proposed change in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concluded that the change does not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not affect the probability of any previously evaluated accidents because the proposed change
only affects postaccident operation. The consequences of an accident are possibly affected by the change since LPCI/torus
fluid could enter the ESW system, and ultimately Long Island Sound, if a positive differential pressure is not maintained
in the LPCI heat exchangers. There is not a significant increase in the probability of adverse consequences however,
since a passive failure of the LPCI heat exchangers tubes would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, at Millstone Unit No. 1, the heat exchangers are only used for occasional torus cooling during the warmer
months of the year. As such, they experience very little use. In addition, eddy current testing and shall side pressurization
demonstrate tube integrity each refueling outage. During operation, quarterly surveillance testing of the LPCI
system will identify if any leakage occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring of the ESW discharge will allow timely detection of any radiological leakage. If a release is detected,
the appropriate actions will be taken as the situation requires. Actions could include the isolation of one heat exchanger,
the throttling of ESW to restore the positive differential pressure with LPCI, or continued operation with the leakage
monitored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of a previously
analyzed accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This change only affects the use of the ESW system under postaccident conditions. The LPCI system will continue to
function as credited in the accident analyses. No other systems or components are affected by this proposed Technical
Specification change. Therefore, this change cannot create a new or different kind of accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This proposed Technical Specification does not affect normal LPCI operation for torus cooling. This Specification
establishes controls which ensure that an unmonitored release does not occur, even if the positive differential
pressure does not exist in the LPCI heat exchanger due to the throttling of LPCI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Removal of the differential pressure by itself does not promote failure of the LPCI heat exchanger. For a release to
occur, the heat exchanger has to fail by an independent method. Both heat exchangers will be eddy current tested each
refueling outage to ensure integrity. Also, routine surveillance of the torus water would detect any leakage in the
heat exchangers during the operating cycle. These measures provide confidence that the integrity of the heat exchangers
will exist at the time of the postulated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The period of time when ESW pressure may be lower than LPCI pressure is limited to several days. Considering the integrity
of the heat exchangers, it is very unlikely that they would develop a leak during this period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although unlikely, if a leak were to develop, it will be detected by the monitoring and sampling. Survey monitoring
would be initiated prior to loss of positive differential pressure. Sampling ensures that any release lower than
the sensitivity of the survey meter would also be detected and quantified. The quantity of the release can be estimated
by assuming that any measured release existed continuously from the time that the positive differential pressure
was lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although not relied upon for maintaining system integrity, the positive differential pressure does provide an additional
layer of defense in depth. In some accident scenarios, it may be replaced by a monitoring and sampling program. If a
release is detected, appropriate action will be taken as the situation requires. Considering the small likelihood
of a release, the small consequences of such a release, and the compensatory measures available, the proposed change
does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

 The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 By July 7, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resources Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or
petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed,
plant name, and publication date and page number of this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry &amp; Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford,
Connecticut 06103&hyph;3499, attorney for the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

In its filling with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule filing is to amend various Exchange Rules which, collectively, define members' rights
and obligations more precisely and give the Exchange more flexibility and protection in dealing with violations
of Exchange Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, with respect to short sales, currently if a member enters into a contract to sell stock, as a general matter he
must believe at that time that he will be able to perform. If he has no intention of performing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 delivering stock on settlement date), then entering into the contract is both fraudulent and a violation of just and
equitable principles of trade. In furtherance of this, the Exchange's proposed rule requires that prior to effecting
a short sale, members make arrangements to borrow the security or obtain other assurances that delivery can be made
on settlement date. Consistent with other exchanges' short sale rules, the new rule provides an exception for bona
fide market making activities.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 However, in order to use the exception, the burden is on the specialist, market maker or odd-lot dealer to show that
the sale was indeed part of bona fide market making activities. In addition, as a monitoring tool, the new short sale
rule requires a specialist, market maker or odd-lot dealer to notify the Exchange whenever he accumulates a position
(long or short) in a security that is greater than or equal to 5% of the outstanding public float of the security.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange also proposes to add new rules under Article VII to give the President of the Exchange greater flexibility
and a greater ability to take summary action against a member if the President has reasonable grounds to believe that
the member is in violation of, and will continue to violate Exchange Rules. This expands the President's ability to
take summary action, which currently applies primarily to situations where the member has financial or operational
difficulties. Under the proposed rules, the summary action could include a suspension, or a limitation on the member's
activities or a limitation on the member's access to Exchange services. Because of the summary nature of the action
that will be permitted by the proposed rules, the Exchange's proposed rules also contain provisions for an expedited
appeal, requiring, among other things, that the appeal be heard within ten (10) days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides that the President, within two business days of taking summary action, furnish the member
with a written statement setting forth the reasons and specific grounds that constitute the basis for the action.
The proposed rule also provides that the member affected may make a request for an appeal by filing a written notice
of appeal with the Secretary of the Exchange within five days after notification of the President's action. Appeals
filed under the proposed rule must be considered and decided by a panel appointed by the Board, composed of three members
of the Board, within ten days. After consideration of the appeal, the panel, by majority vote, affirms, reverses,
or modifies the action upon which the appeal was made. All decisions of the panel are final.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules also adopt a formal standard of review for the hearing of appeals. Currently, there is no articulated
standard of review contained in the Exchange's rules. The standard in the proposed rules prohibits an appeal panel
from overturning the fact finder's decision if the factual conclusions in that decision are supported by substantial
evidence and if the decision itself is not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules also add provisions relating to Exchange liability and suits filed against the Exchange and its
employees. Current Exchange rules limit liability against the Exchange as a result of a member's use or enjoyment
of the Exchange facilities.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The rules of MBS Clearing Corporation limit its liability to members to a broader extent.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rules limit the liability of the Exchange to its members to situations where the Exchange has acted willfully
or with gross negligence.

The Commission notes that the proposed rule purports to limit the liability of the Exchange to third parties, as well
as to Exchange members. The following is the text of the proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange shall use its best efforts to perform its duties and responsibilities in the manner specified in the Rules
but shall have no liability to any member or any third party for any loss, cost, expense, damage or liability for nonperformance
or misperformance of such duties and responsibilities, except to the extent that it is attributable to the willful
misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or fraudulent or criminal acts of the Exchange or its officers, employees
or agents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The possibility of this type of suit against individual staff members of the Exchange when they are acting on Exchange
business makes it impossible for such persons to perform their duties. The proposed rule also prohibits a member form
suing any officer, director, employee or agent of the Exchange or any of its subsidiaries or any other Exchange official,
if such person is acting on Exchange business or business of any of its subsidiaries. This proposed rule does not, however,
prohibit a member from suing the Exchange as a result of the actions of these individuals; rather, it merely prohibits
suits against the persons in his or her individual capacity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is the text of the proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No member or member organization shall institute a lawsuit or any other type of legal proceeding against any officer,
director, employee or agent of the Exchange or any of its subsidiaries or any other Exchange official, if such person
is acting on Exchange business or business of any of its subsidiaries except for as violation of the federal securities
laws and except, with respect to Governors of the Exchange to the extent inconsistent with the Exchange's Certificate
of Incorporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the proposed rule adds a provision that requires a member who fails to prevail in a legal proceeding instituted
by that member against CHX or other specified parties
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 to pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by CHX in defense of such proceeding. This requirement
to pay CHX's expenses, however, is only triggered if CHX's expenses exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000). This
will minimize the impact of this new rule for small members that pursue claims against CHX but do not prevail at an early
stage. When in place, the rule will serve to discourage frivolous and harassment-type suits against CHX.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would apply to legal proceeding instituted by members against the Exchange or any of its officers,
directors, committee members, employees or agents, and specifically would not apply to internal disciplinary actions
or administrative appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Exchange proposes to amend Article VIII to make conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of a fair and
orderly market or the protection of investors a violation of Exchange Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest, and is not designed
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Solicitation of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The CBOE states that the 1993 Circular is designed to assist floor brokers in understanding their responsibilities
under the CBOE's Rules, the Act, and the Commission's regulations. On June 19, 1986, the CBOE issued a Regulatory Circular
(``1986 Circular'') which describes, among other things, the steps that should be taken when a floor broker proposes
to ``leg in'' a multi-part order or to cross customer orders pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.74, ```Crossing' Orders.'' In
addition, the 1986 Circular sets forth procedures to be followed when there has been a ``print-through''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 on a limit order or an order is not otherwise executed due to a floor broker's error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``print through'' occurs when a trade is effected in the crowd at a price that is better than the price at which a customer
order should have been represented by a floor broker in the trading crowd. The 1993 Circular states that if a broker
discovers a print-through during trading hours and a better price is available at the time, the customer order should
be filled at the better price. If the better price is no longer available, then the floor broker is responsible at the
original limit price and may either execute the order at the available market and give the customer a ``different check''
or fill the order out of his error account, provided it does not reduce or liquidate a position in the error account.
If the print-through is discovered outside trading hours and the customer requires a fill as of that trade date, the
floor broker may fill the customer's order at the limit price from his error account. If the print-through occurs on
the opening, the customer is generally entitled to the number of contracts which print through at the opening price.
If a better price than the opening price is available when the error is discovered, the customer order should be filled
at the better price.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 Circular restates and expands upon the subjects discussed in the 1986 Circular. For example, the 1993 Circular
provides a more detailed discussion of recordkeeping requirements, restates the procedures applicable to a print-through
on a limit order, and makes clear that, except as otherwise specified, a floor broker is not permitted to fill the customer
order from his error account if doing so would reduce or liquidate a position in the broker's error account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the 1986 Circular explains that the CBOE's Rules do not prohibit the ``legging'' of multi-part orders
as long as the executing floor broker remains in compliance with the CBOE's rules concerning the use of due diligence
in the execution of customer orders and the separation of market maker and floor broker functions. The 1993 Circular
expands upon the treatment of this subject by setting forth specific procedures that are to be followed when a floor
broker discovers that he is unable to complete the execution of a multi-part order.

Specifically, the 1993 Circular states that if a floor broker determines that he is unable to complete an order he has
legged he must either: (1) Offer the executed leg to the customer; (2) liquidate the leg in open outcry and then offer
the trade, regardless of whether it is a profit or loss, to the customer; or (3) execute the remaining leg(s) of the order
at the available market in open outcry and give the customer a difference check. In addition, the 1993 Circular notes
that a floor broker may not provide an execution on the unexecuted portion of the order from his error account; by doing
so he is acting as a market maker.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 Circular also provides guidance to floor brokers with respect to subjects that were not covered in the 1986
Circular. These subjects include the priority of customer orders in a floor broker's ``deck,'' the ``stopping''
of customer orders, and trading in securities underlying options traded by a floor broker. Specifically, with regard
to a floor broker's ``deck,'' the 1993 Circular states that under Exchange Rule 6.73, a floor broker's agency business
takes priority over trades for his error account and that a floor broker must determine the priority of agency orders
entered simultaneously with him. The 1993 Circular also states that a floor broker must use due diligence to execute
those orders at the best available price or prices. With regard to the ``stopping'' of customer orders, the 1993 Circular
states that it is improper for a floor broker to ``stop'' or guarantee an execution to a customer order he is holding
from his error account or deck because by doing so he is acting as a market maker and is in violation of CBOE Rule 8.8. The
1993 Circular notes that it is not a violation of CBOE Rule 8.8 for a floor broker to cross a public customer order with
a facilitation order in accordance with the provisions of CBOE Rule 6.74(b), ```Crossing' Orders.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, with regard to the trading of underlying securities, the 1993 Circular states that the CBOE's rules do not
prohibit a floor broker from entering into transactions on other exchanges for his personal account in financial
instruments underlying or related to the classes at the station where he acts as a floor broker. Because trading in
the underlying financial instrument could be perceived as a conflict of interest, the Equity and Index Floor Procedure
Committees strongly advise against it. The 1993 Circular states that it would be a violation of the CBOE's rules for
a floor broker to enter into transactions in an underlying or related financial instrument based on information concerning
a customer option order which he holds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE states that the 1993 Circular is designed to provide guidance to floor brokers regarding the Exchange's interpretation
of applicable CBOE Rules, the Act, and Commission regulations. The CBOE states that the 1993 Circular is not intended
to be a comprehensive discussion of the named subjects, but is designed to supplement existing Exchange rules and
Interpretations and Policies relating thereto for the purpose of providing CBOE members with authoritative guidance
regarding the Exchange's interpretation of its rules, the Act, and Commission regulations in certain specific contexts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed 1993 Circular is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in particular, in that it will provide guidance to CBOE members regarding
the obligations of floor brokers under CBOE rules, the Act, and Commission regulations, and is thereby designed to
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed 1993 Circular is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) in that the 1993 Circular is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors
and the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the 1993 Circular should help to provide floor brokers with a clear explanation
of certain of their obligations under the Act, the Commission's regulations, and the CBOE's rules, thereby helping
to ensure the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. The Commission believes that the 1993 Circular should facilitate
the execution of customer orders at the best available prices by providing guidance with regard to print-throughs
and orders executed erroneously, and by stating that floor brokers representing customer orders have a fiduciary
obligation to their clients to execute their orders on the CBOE floor at the best available prices. The 1993 Circular
also notes that a floor broker's due diligence in handling an order includes the floor broker's insuring that all market
or marketable limit orders are constantly represented in the crowd either by himself or by another floor broker for
as long as the order is active.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission believes that the 1993 Circular should help to ensure the integrity and fairness of the
CBOE's markets by advising members of restrictions on floor brokers' activities. Specifically, the 1993 Circular
notes that the CBOE's rules prohibit a member from trading as a market maker with respect to option contracts traded
at a particular station on the same day that the member is acting as a floor broker at that station. The 1993 Circular
also contains provisions designed to ensure that floor brokers do not engage in abusive or illegal trading. In this
regard, the 1993 Circular makes clear that it is a violation of the CBOE's rules for a floor broker to enter into transactions
in an underlying or related financial instrument based on information concerning a customer option order which he
holds.

Finally, the Commission believes that it is beneficial for the CBOE to codify in a circular existing Exchange policies
and procedures regarding floor broker activity. The Commission believes that the 1993 Circular will make it easier
for floor brokers to understand and have access to relevant policies and procedures with respect to their obligations
as floor brokers.

(1) Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to bring the Exchange's arbitration rules more closely in line with SICA's
Uniform Code of Arbitration (the ``Uniform Code'' or ``Code''). To that end, the Exchange is proposing several conforming
changes to its arbitration rules and is also proposing other changes which will facilitate the administration of
the CHX arbitration forum in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is also redesignating most of the section references to Rule 24 in order to conform its rule reference
to SICA's Uniform Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHX is proposing to add a provision (CHX Rule 24, Section 1(c)) to its arbitration rules providing that class actions
will not be eligible for submission to arbitration. However, an individual may pursue a claim in arbitration if class
certification is denied; the case is decertified; the customer is excluded from the class; or the customer elects
not to participate in the putative or certified class action or has complied with other court prescribed conditions
for withdrawal. The Exchange is amending Section 33 of Rule 24 (redesignated as Section 31) requiring the addition
of a provision to pre-dispute arbitration agreements regarding the ineligibility of class actions for arbitration.

Rule 24, Section 31, Paragraph 5 is proposed to state that all agreements shall include a statement that ``no person
shall bring a punitive or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration
agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; who is a member of a putative class
who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until (i) the class
certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the class by the court.
Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this agreement
except to the extent stated herein.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 24, Section 1 adds Interpretation and Policy .01 which addresses an existing Exchange policy regarding the determination
whether to accept a claim for arbitration at the Exchange. The Exchange's policy is to accept a claim for arbitration
if the Exchange is the Designated Examining Authority (``DEA'') of the Respondent member or if the enforcement of
the applicable rules has not been ceded to another self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') pursuant to its Rule 17d&hyph;2
Agreement.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In other cases, the Exchange may decline the use of its arbitration facilities if the nexus between the dispute and
the Exchange is minimal.

Pursuant to Rule 17d&hyph;2 under the Act, any two or more SROs may file with the Commission a plan for allocating among
the SROs the responsibility to receive regulatory reports from persons who are members or participants of more than
one of such SROs to examine such persons for compliance, or to enforce compliance by such persons, with specified provisions
of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of such SROs, or to carry out other specified regulatory
functions with respect to such persons. See 17 CFR 240.17d&hyph;2 (1994).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange considers claims submitted to the arbitration department on a case-by-case basis and examines the policy
described above in determining whether a claim will be accepted. Under the Exchange's policy, the only discretion
on whether the Exchange will accept a claim for arbitration occurs when the Exchange is not the DEA for the Respondent
member and the enforcement of a particular rule has not been ceded to another SRO pursuant to Rule 17d&hyph;2. In this
event, as stated above, the Exchange may reject the claim for arbitration if the nexus between the dispute and the Exchange
is minimal. This can be demonstrated by the following example. Suppose a Respondent member firm was a member of the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE``), National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), and the
CHX, and the NYSE was the firm's DEA. Suppose that the dispute involved alleged NASD sales practice violations covering
150 transactions. Suppose further that out of those 150 transactions, only two were executed on the CHX. In that event,
the Exchange would most likely decline the use of its arbitration facilities based on minimal contacts that the dispute
had with the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the policy places fair limitations upon the responsibility of the Exchange to make its
arbitration facilities available by requiring that the underlying dispute have some minimal nexus (or contacts)
to the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 24, Section 1 also adds interpretation and policy .02 which extends jurisdiction over former members and member

In addition, the Exchange proposes to amend Section 13(d) to state that in arbitrations where there are multiple Claimants,
Respondents or Third party Respondents, the Director of Arbitrations shall be authorized to determine preliminarily
whether such parties should proceed in the same or separate arbitrations. Such determinations will be considered
subsequent to the filing of all responsive pleadings. The Director of Arbitration shall be authorized to determine
preliminarily whether claims filed separately are related and shall be authorized to consolidate such claims for
hearing and award purposes.

Section 13(d)(1) is proposed to state that all persons may join in one action as Claimants if they assert any right to
relief jointly, severally, or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series or transactions or occurrences

one action as respondents if there is asserted against them jointly or severally any right to relief arising out of
the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any questions of law or fact common
to all respondents will arise in the action. A Claimant or respondent need not assert rights to or defend against all
the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the claimants according to their respective rights to
relief, and against one or more respondents according to their respective liabilities.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 13, 1991, the Commission approved, on a temporary basis through December 31, 1992, a rule change authorizing
GSCC to implement a non-member, ``executing firm'' information feature as an enhancement to its comparison service.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 On December 23, 1992, the Commission extended its temporary approval of the executing firm feature until June 30,
1994.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change allows GSCC netting members to submit trading activity of non-members to GSCC. The proposal
effectively expands the scope of trades eligible for GSCC's comparison and netting systems by allowing GSCC to identify,
compare, and net trades where one or both sides to the transaction are non-members that have entered into clearing
or correspondent arrangements with a GSCC member. The proposal will not result in GSCC's interacting directly with
non-members.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to its first submission on behalf of a non-member (``executing firm''), the GSCC member (``submitting member'')
must provide notice to GSCC of each executing firm on whose behalf the submitting member intends to act. The submitting
member must indicate whether the executing firm's trades are to be compared and netted, or compared only. The submitting
member's obligations to GSCC with respect to the non-member trade are the same as if the submitting member had executed
the trade. Therefore, if the submitting member permits non-member trades to be included in GSCC's netting system,
such member's margin and clearing fund deposits will be calculated based on its trades and non-member trades submitted
to the netting system. The submitting member also will be required to complete delivery, receipt, and payment on netted
trades of executing firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A submitting member would submit trades to GSCC on behalf of an executing firm that it clears for by indicating to the
comparison system: (1) The name of the executing party associated with the member; and (2) the name of the executing
party associated with the contra-party member. In general, for a comparison to be generated by GSCC, there must be
an exact match of all required match data,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 except for the contract value for which GSCC may set a tolerance on a systemwide basis. In order to minimize the number
of uncompared trades that this system could initiate, GSCC in some instances may permit comparison even if certain
fields do not match. If the identity of the executing firm does not match, GSCC may still compare a trade based on a match
of submitting members. If the submitting party for the contra-party executing firm is incorrectly identified, GSCC
may compare the trade if it has received notice from a GSCC member that it wishes to be deemed the appropriate submitting
party for such executing firm. If data on a trade submitted against a member does not compare, but would compare if matched
against data submitted by an affiliate of such member, GSCC may compare the transaction as if the member had submitted
the trade against the affiliate.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 If a trade is submitted without identifying an executing party, GSCC will compare the trade as if there is no executing
party for that side of the trade. GSCC would, if requested, translate a member's internal contra-participant identifiers
to a valid GSCC member identifying number.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act provides that the rules of a clearing agency must promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions and remove impediments to perfect the mechanism of a national system for
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. By accepting non-member trades into
GSCC's comparison system, a greater number of trades are included in the national clearance and settlement system.
These trades are given the benefit of a centralized clearance and settlement system.

In the initial approval order,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission stated that GSCC should encourage its members to be more accurate in the data they submit in order to
reduce, and eventually eliminate, the need for GSCC to substitute or supplement data on behalf of members. The Commission
also stated that GSCC should track the identity of the submitting member and the executing firm in order to identify
by type of match each trade involving a non-member. The Commission stated that the tracking should provide a basis
for GSCC to test the accuracy of member input. Finally, the Commission requested that GSCC provide on a quarterly basis
during the temporary approval period data concerning GSCC's comparison rates.

GSCC reports that since January of this year, the rate of successfully compared trades executed by non-member firms
was 63%.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 This figure is down slightly from the 69% figure reported to the Commission for the third quarter of 1992.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 In order to increase the comparison rate, GSCC issues a report each month to members indicating the comparison rate
for member trades and for non-member trades.

 GSCC will counsel firms that have low comparison rates for non-member trades.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, twelve firms act as submitting members for a total of 271 non-member executing firms. This is a substantial
increase from December 1992, when four firms acted as submitting members, for a total of fifty-eight non-members.
GSCC should continue to attract more firms that provide a correspondent clearing service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that GSCC should be able to deem a trade as compared when both sides of the trade do not agree
as to the executing firm information.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 GSCC structured the proposal in this manner to facilitate the successful comparison of trades because not all GSCC
members' internal systems are equipped to accommodate additional information fields. The Commission believes
that as participation in the executing firm program grows, the exceptions to the requirements for a matched trade
will help bolster the percentage of successfully compared trades.

Other clearing agencies have programs which allow trades to compare even though certain items do not precisely match.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GSCC has had more than two years experience in administering the program. To date, GSCC has not experienced any operational
or other problems with regard to the executing firm feature. While the Commission believes that GSCC should continue
to work to improve the comparison rate, the Commission also believes that GSCC has demonstrated sufficient expertise
to warrant permanent approval of this rule filing.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;02) be, and hereby

The NASD requests the Commission to find good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NASD and Nasdaq believe that accelerated approval is appropriate because: (1) The instant fee increase to $9.75/terminal/month
is below the $10 maximum originally approved by the Commission in 1982 for subscribers to access the Last Sale information
on more than 1,000 reportable securities;
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 (2) the increase of $.75/terminal/month will entitle vendors' subscribers to access real-time last sale data on
substantially more securities, approximately 20,000 issues classified as OTC Equity Securities (hereinafter
referred to as ``OTC equities'');
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 (3) the amount of the increase is reasonable in light of (i) the number of additional reportable issues, (ii) their
relative share volume in comparison to the volume being reported in Nasdaq-listed securities, and (iii) the amount
of additional data that must be collected, processed, and distributed to support the expanded Last Sale Service;
(4) the expanded data has been available to vendors' subscribers since April 4, 1994 at no additional charge; and (5)
the next bi-monthly billing cycle for Last Sale Service begins on June 1, 1994 and the increased fee will be applied
prospectively.

This rule change is designed to effect an increase of $.75/terminal/month for receipt of an expanded Last Sale Service
that now includes real-time transaction reports in OTC equities. Last Sale Service is provided to the subscribers
of authorized vendors who redistribute last sale information pursuant to an agreement with Nasdaq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual distribution of last sale information that includes trade reports on OTC equities commenced on April 4,
1994. Access to this expanded stream of last sale information is now provided to all subscribers who had been receiving
last sale information on Nasdaq-listed securities. The proposed fee increase will apply prospectively to all such
subscribers, starting June 1, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In sum, a bundled last sale service_covering all Nasdaq-listed securities and all domestic OTC equities_will be
provided to vendors' subscribers for a single monthly charge of $9.75/terminal.

The NASD and Nasdaq believe that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 15A(b)(5)
of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15A(b)(5) specifies that the rules of a national securities association shall provide for the equitable
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among members, issuers and other persons using any facility
or system that the Association operates or controls. The proposed increase of $.75/terminal/month represents an
8.3% increase over the prevailing rate. This increase is designed to offset the developmental and operating costs
associated with extending real-time trade reporting to a large universe of OTC equities, numbering more than 20,000
securities. This universe includes approximately 4,200 OTC equities that are quoted in the OTC Bulletin Board Service
(``OTCBB''). In terms of reported share volume for the month ending January 31, 1994, share volume attributable to
OTC equities quoted in the OTCBB equaled 8.4% of share volume in Nasdaq-listed securities; the comparable figure
for OTC equities not quoted in the OTCBB was approximately 11% of Nasdaq share volume. Accordingly, the NASD and Nasdaq
believe that the proposed 8.4% increase in the last sale charge is reasonable in relation to the expanded base of reportable
securities and the relative share volume in those issues for which last sale data will be collected, processed and
disseminated. Lastly, the amended fee remains below the $10/terminal/month maximum that the Commission previously
approved when real-time trade reporting commenced for Nasdaq-listed securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(5), which
specifies that the rules of a national securities association provided for the equitable allocation of reasonable
dues, fees, and any other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the
association operates or controls. As discussed above, the present proposal sets subscribers fees at $9.75 per terminal
which is below the $10.00 terminal ceiling that the Commission, in 1982, found to be reasonable for subscriber access
to last sale reports for over 1,000 Nasdaq/National Market securities. The Commission believes that the present
proposal is consistent with the 1982 order because subscribers now may access last sales reports in over 20,000 securities,
which nearly 4000 are Nasdaq/National Market securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission increase is consistent with the 1982 order. The Commission also believes that accelerated approval
of the present proposal is appropriate because, since April 4, 1994, subscribers have been receiving last sale information
at no additional charge in the expanded universe of securities that recently became subject to last sale reporting
requirements.

Amendment No. 1 limited the proposed rule change to NYSE Rule 79A.30 to securities trading at $100 or over. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28202 (July 13, 1990), 55

II. Description of the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, all transactions made at one point or more away from the last previous sale when such previous sale is under
$20 per share, or at two points or more away from the last previous sale when such previous sale is at $20 per share or over,
may not be published on the tape without the prior approval of a Floor Official.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The rule change to NYSE Rule 79A.30 will permit a Floor Governor, during unusual market conditions, to change the two
point parameter requiring Floor Official approval for a particular security when the last previous sale for such
security occurs at $100 per share or more. The special price parameter will apply only for the trading day it was approved,
but may be re-confirmed by the Floor Governor for subsequent trading sessions for the particular security on a day-by-day
basis. Once a Floor Governor has established a special price parameter, a Floor Official must approve the publication
on the tape of any trade that exceeds such parameter, except when Floor Governor approval is required under Rule 123A.40,
as discussed below. Changes to the two point parameter must be reported to the Exchange's Market Surveillance Division
by the Floor Governor.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NYSE Rule 123A.40 prohibits a specialist from trading for his own account in a stock in which he is registered if the
trade would result in electing any stop order on his book, unless (i) his bid or offer has the effect of bettering the
market, (ii) a Floor Official approves the transaction, and (iii) the stop order is guaranteed to be executed at the
same price as the electing sale.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 While the above requirements would remain for transactions where the specialist's bid or offer results in the election
of a stop order, under the proposal a specialist would be permitted to participate in a trade solely for the purpose
of facilitating the completion of an order at a single price where the depth of the current public bid or offer (which
would not be the specialist's bid or offer) is not sufficient to do so, without guaranteeing the execution price of
any stop orders elected by the transaction and without obtaining Floor Official approval for each transaction. The
proposal, however, requires a specialist to obtain the approval of a Floor Governor rather than a floor official as
currently required, prior to engaging in a transaction for his own account at the electing sale price if a stop order
will be elected (pursuant to the rule's conditions) and executed at a price outside the price parameters provided
in NYSE Rule 79A.40.

Stop orders are orders which become executable market or limit orders once the price specified on the order is reached

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public.

The Commission believes that the rule change to NYSE Rule 79A.30 to permit a Floor Governor to change the two point parameter
for transactions in securities trading at $100 or over, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it will
facilitate trading during unusual market conditions. The Commission believes that the rule change may help to minimize
the possibility of delays in reporting trades to the Tape during highly volatile trading days by eliminating the need
to obtain Floor Official approval for certain trades of higher priced securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, because Floor Official approval is required for each transaction to be executed outside of the price
parameters once a Floor Governor approves a change, the Commission believes that the rule change provides appropriate
Exchange oversight of trades away from the last sale of a security, which will help to ensure that specialists satisfy
their market making responsibilities during unusual market conditions.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, all changes in the two point parameter will be reported to the exchange's Market Surveillance Division
by the Floor Governor, thereby providing Exchange oversight of the Floor Governor's decision. The Commission further
believes requiring that the decision to change the two point price parameter be made by a Floor Governor on a day-by-day
basis will emphasize the intent that the two point parameter be changed only in unusual circumstances.

Under Section 11 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78k, specialists have the responsibility to act as dealers to the extent necessary
to maintain fair and orderly markets, which includes tempering sudden price movements and keeping any general price
movements orderly. See Division of Market Regulation, October 1987 Market Break Report, at 4&hyph;3.

This rule change is intended to apply only to intra-day trading, and will not affect opening transactions. See Letter
from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Howard Kramer, Assistant Director, Division of
Market Regulation, dated June 12, 1990. The Exchange states that it has a ``a long-standing policy of requiring Floor
Official approval for the opening trades in any stock transaction that will result in a price change of *&blank;*&blank;*
two points or more away from a last sale of $20 or more.''

The Commission believes the rule change to NYSE Rule 123A.40 to permit specialists to participate in transactions
which result in the election of stop orders without guaranteeing the execution price of the stop orders is consistent
with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it will benefit investors by facilitating single-price executions of orders.
Currently, when a market order arrives at a specialist's post and the depth of the current bid or offer is not sufficient
to provide a single-price execution of the order, the specialist cannot participate in the transaction if a stop order
would be elected without guaranteeing the price of the stop order and obtaining Floor Official approval. When the
specialist does not participate, the market order is partially executed against the best bid or offer, and partially
executed against any elected stop orders and limit orders on the specialist's book, usually at different prices.
The rule change allows the specialist to participate in such transactions without guaranteeing the price of any elected
stop orders or obtaining Floor Official approval, and thereby makes it more likely that specialists will provide
investors with single-price execution of their orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Commission views the prohibition on specialist participation in the election of stop orders as helpful
in guarding against the potential for abuse,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 we recognize that certain benefits can accrue from permitting limited specialist participation under the conditions
set forth in the rule to facilitate single price executions. Specifically, unlike the situation where the specialist
enters his own bid or offer, when a specialist participates in the execution of a customer's market order under the
proposed rule, he will not be setting the price of the transaction that elects the stop orders. Rather, the price will
be determined by another market participant, independent of any price-setting determination by the specialist.
The Commission therefore believes that allowing specialists to facilitate single-price execution of market orders
through passive participation will not negatively affect the execution of stop orders elected by the transactions,
and does not present the opportunity for abuses that may be present were the specialist is actively setting the price
through his own proprietary bids or offers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision of Rule 123A.40 that requires specialists to guarantee the price of elected stop orders and requires
floor official approval when a specialist elects stop orders through his own bid or offer are intended to address,
in part, the situation where a specialist has an accumulation of stop orders and desires to ``clean up the book.'' This
can be accomplished by the specialist entering a bid, for example, that elects all of the stop sell orders at the lowest
stop order price, or by electing stop sell orders in a series of descending prices until the lowest order is reached.
The specialist could use these stop order election processes to drive the share price down to an artificially low level
in order to obtain cheap stock at the expense of the public customers. The potential for this type of abuse is not present,
however, where a customer market order sets the trading price and incidentally elects stop orders of which the customer
was unaware.

The Commission further believes that the rule change requiring Floor Governor approval for any transactions which
will result in the execution of an elected stop order outside the one or two point parameters contained in NYSE Rule
79A.30, or any temporary parameters established by a Floor Governor during unusual market conditions pursuant thereto,
will provide increased scrutiny of gap-executions of stop orders and thereby benefit investors consistent with
section 6(b)(5) of the Act. The Commission notes that under Rule 79A.30, Floor Official approval is needed for transactions
effected outside the price parameters contained therein, but that under Rule 123A.40, Floor Governor approval is
necessary for the execution of stop orders outside the price parameters of Rule, 79A.30 when the stop orders are elected
by a transaction in which a specialist participated. The Commission believes this increased Exchange oversight
of specialists' proprietary activity will provide investors with additional protection against potential trading
abuses related to the execution of stop orders.

Exchange Rule 96 currently prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or Registered Competitive Market Maker (``RCMM'')
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 from initiating, while on the Floor of the Exchange, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's
account, of any stock in which he has an option position or in which he knows that his member organization has an option
position. Competitive Traders and RCMMs are not subject to any direct limitation on their trading of options; however,
once an NYSE Floor professional acquires an option position, he must effect subsequent proprietary transactions
in the underlying stock pursuant to an off-Floor order.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 At present, Rule 96 applies to all options, including those traded on a national securities exchange (``listed options'')
and those traded over-the-counter (``OTC options'').

A Competitive Trader is an NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange
but who is not registered as a specialist, odd-lot dealer or Registered Competitive Market Maker. See NYSE rules 111
&amp; 112(e). Competitive Traders exist pursuant to, and must comply with the requirements of, Section 11(a)(1)(G)
of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the NYSE requires that 75 percent of a Competitive Trader's
monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See NYSE Rule 112(d).

they must comply with a complex series of rules about the price at which they can trade and the size of those trades. See
NYSE Rule 107. Unlike Competitive Traders, RCMMs have an affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market.

The NYSE proposes to remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. As a result, a Competitive Trader or RCMM
with a listed option position in a stock will be permitted to initiate an on-Floor proprietary trade in that stock.
In contrast, an NYSE Floor professional with an OTC option position in the same stock will continue to be subject to
Rule 96's restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the statutory bases for the proposed rule change are Sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(c)(ii)
of the Act. According to the NYSE, by removing the prohibition on Competitive Traders and RCMMs initiating proprietary
transactions on the Floor in a stock where they have a listed option position in such stock, and thereby permitting
such members to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market in situations where they may not currently do so,
the proposed rule change will have the effect of ``facilitating transactions in securities'' and will ``perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market,'' as called for in Section 6(b)(5).

The NYSE also believes that, to the extent that the proposed rule change permits Floor professionals to initiate transactions
on a more equal regulatory footing with other securities professionals, the proposed rule change is designed to eliminate
unfair discrimination between brokers or dealers, as called for in Section 6(b)(5); to remove a burden on competition
not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as called for in Section 6(b)(8); and to promote
fair competition among brokers and dealers, as called for in Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Sections 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the

In light of the changes in market structure that have taken place since Rule 96 was adopted, the Commission believes
that the benefits of the NYSE proposal outweigh any burdens it may impose. Specifically, the Commission has concluded
that the proposed rule change should enhance the quality of the NYSE market. The NYSE established the membership categories
of Competitive Trader and RCMM to provide a means by which NYSE members could, under certain conditions, add depth
and liquidity to the market by initiating proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission, however, notes that Rule 96 may frustrate that purpose,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 to the extent it may be unnecessarily restrictive given the risks posed by Competitive Traders' and RCMMs' dealings
in stocks in which they (or their member organization) have an option position.

The NYSE argues that the ability of a Competitive Trader or RCMM with an option position to trade the underlying stock
pursuant to an off-Floor order may not be meaningful, given how these Floor professionals routinely conduct their
business. If so, there could be a disincentive for any NYSE member who participates in the options market (or who is
associated with a member organization that participates in the options market) to be active as a Competitive Trader

After careful review, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposal may reduce the current disincentive for members,
especially options market participants and their associated persons, to act as a Competitive Trader or RCMM given
Rule 96's restrictions.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 For instance, NYSE members currently serving as Competitive Traders and RCMMs could initiate proprietary Floor
Trades in situations where they presently cannot do so; moreover, other members might be encouraged to serve in that
capacity. In the Commission's view, an increase in the capital committed to such supplemental market making activities
could improve the depth and liquidity of the NYSE market, particularly in times of market stress.

Furthermore, the Commission is satisfied that the NYSE proposal contains adequate safeguards to protect investors
in the securities markets. In this respect, the Commission notes that a comprehensive regulatory framework has been
developed for the trading of listed securities, including listed options.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 For example, in 1983, an Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') was formed to coordinate more effectively surveillance
and information sharing arrangements between the stock and options markets.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Using procedures developed in that forum, among other things, the national securities exchanges identify and investigate
stock and/or options transactions that, used on certain parameters, raise manipulative concerns. The Commission
believes that this regulatory scheme, including NYSE monitoring and surveillance of amended Rule 96, should be sufficient
to detect and deter intermarket manipulation and other fraudulent or abusive practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Listed options are standardized contracts traded in an open auction market environment. Exchange-traded options
are subject, among other things, to real-time quotation and last-sale reporting; anti-fraud provisions; and minimum
criteria for initial and continued listing. Transactions in listed options become part of the integrated audit trail.
In contrast, OTC options are individualized contracts that are negotiated between the counterparties. There is
minimal, if any, public disclosure and a relatively illiquid secondary trading market.

The full members of the ISG are the American Stock Exchange; the Boston Stock Exchange; the Chicago Board Options Exchange;
the Chicago Stock Exchange; the National Association of Securities Dealers; the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange;
and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the NYSE has informed the Commission that the Exchange will increase the frequency of its examination
of the trading activity of Competitive Traders and RCMMs. The Commission expects that NYSE staff will utilize such
information as part of its on-going efforts to ensure compliance with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder
and Exchange rules. In this respect, the Exchange has assured the Commission that, if a transaction raises concerns
about intermarket manipulation, NYSE staff, with the cooperation of the options exchanges where appropriate, will
conduct a thorough examination of all the relevant facts. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the NYSE's monitoring
and surveillance of Rule 96, as amended, will aid the Exchange in detecting any trading abuses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More generally, the Commission agrees with the Exchange that, independent of Rule 96, other NYSE rules, which the
NYSE will continue to monitor for compliance, should help to keep Floor professionals from being in a position where
they can engage in trading abuses. As examples, the NYSE cites the yielding requirement imposed on certain on-Floor
orders for a member's own account,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 and the conditions placed on when a Competitive Trader or RCMM can initiate a proprietary Floor trade.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Further, Competitive Traders and RCMMs, like other NYSE members, are subject to the prohibition on frontrunning
of block transactions.

Under NYSE Rule 108, an on-Floor order placed by a member to establish or increase a position in the member's proprietary

Finally, the Commission notes that, Competitive Traders and RCMMs currently are not prohibited from trading in stocks
in which they have an existing option position. Such transactions, however, must be initiated off-Floor. To the extent
that the amended rule will permit such transactions to be initiated on-Floor, NYSE surveillance should detect and
deter any trading abuses derived from informational advantages. In sum, the Commission believes that the proposed
rule change should not materially affect the NYSE's ability to address the regulatory concerns raised by Floor professionals'
intermarket trading activity.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each of the Funds is a registered open-end management investment company that is authorized to issue shares in series.
The existing series of the Funds are money market funds. One of the Funds and the series thereof are designed exclusively
for institutional investors, particularly banks seeking investment of assets on behalf of fiduciary or trust accounts.
Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Inc. serves as investment adviser to the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The number of outstanding shares of each Fund can fluctuate significantly, even on a daily basis, particularly
for those sold to institutions. From time to time, the number of shares held of record by a bank in a master account for
its agency or fiduciary accounts could exceed 5% of a Fund's outstanding voting shares. In that case, the Fund would
become an Affiliated person of the bank and the prohibitions of section 17 would apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants seek an exemption from sections 17(a) and 17(e)(1) to permit the Funds to engage in certain transactions
with ``Affiliated Banks.'' For purposes of this application, ``Affiliated Banks'' are banks, bank holding companies,
or affiliated persons thereof that are affiliated persons of the Funds 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
solely
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because they: (a) Directly or indirectly own, control, or hold with the power to vote 5% of the outstanding voting securities
of any of the Funds; or (b) act as investment adviser to any of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The exemption from section 17(a) would permit the Funds to purchase both long and short-term U.S. government securities
from Affiliated Banks that act as primary dealers in these securities.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The exemption from section 17(a) also would permit a Fund to enter into repurchase agreement transactions with, or
purchase short-term obligations issued by, an Affiliated Bank, provided that all such securities meet the credit
standards set forth in condition 1 below (``Qualified Securities''). The exemption from section 17(e)(1) would
permit an Affiliated Bank, acting as an agent for any Fund in connection with the purchase or sale of U.S. government
securities or tax-exempt obligations, to accept compensation that would be permitted a broker under the limitations
of section 17(e)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in the application, the term U.S. government securities are securities that are guaranteed as to payment of
principal and interest by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Primary dealers in U.S. government securities are dealers that are permitted to deal directly with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. In purchasing and selling U.S. government securities, it is critical that the Funds obtain
prompt execution of their transactions at a competitive cost. Each primary dealer is a major factor in the U.S. government
securities market. If the Fund cannot trade with one or more primary dealers, the Funds may be deprived of the most favorable
price and execution as against other dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants believe that the elimination of even a few major banks from the universe of money market instrument issuers
and dealers with whom the Funds may do business would have a noticeable impact on portfolio management flexibility.
Each issuer of Qualified Securities contributes to the depth and liquidity of the market for short-term obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Commercial banks are important factors in the municipal bond dealer community, particularly in the general obligation
area. The municipal bond market is more disparate, much less structured, and considerably less liquid than the market
for money market instruments. As a result, much greater reliance is placed on the dealer community to keep portfolio
managers apprised of, and to supply the Funds with, suitable issues of municipal securities, as well as to assist in
the disposition of portfolio securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Funds' board of directors, trustees, or managing general partners will be responsible for adopting and monitoring
appropriate methods to ensure that the price and terms of transactions in U.S. government securities and Qualified
Securities will be reasonable and fair to participating Funds. In evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of
transactions in U.S. government securities, a Fund or its investment adviser will obtain and document competitive
quotations from at least one other dealer. In evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of transactions in Qualified
Securities, applicants may use a matrix pricing system to assess the price offered by the Affiliated Bank relative
to market transactions involving comparable securities.

Applicants' Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 2(a)(3) defines an ``affiliated person'' of another person as, among other persons: (a) Any person directly
or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with the power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities
of such other person; (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned,
controlled, or held with power to vote, by such other person; (c) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with, such other person; (d) any officer,director, partner, copartner, or employee of
such other person; and (e) if such other person is an investment company, any investment adviser thereof or any member
of an advisory board thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. By virtue of section 2(a)(3), if a bank owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote more than 5% of the outstanding
shares of a Fund, that bank is an affiliated person of the Fund. Any person who is an affiliated person of a registered
investment company also may be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person of each other registered investment
company which has a common investment adviser, or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of each other,
or common directors or common officers, or a combination of the foregoing because such investment companies may be
deemed to be under common control. Accordingly, a bank, bank holding company, or affiliated person thereof that is
deemed to be an affiliated person of one Fund may be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person of all the
other Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 17(a) provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, knowingly to sell any security or other property
to such registered investment company or to purchase from such registered investment company any security or other
property. The operation of these provisions could prohibit all of the Funds from engaging in a variety of transactions
with a wide range of banks, bank holding companies, and affiliated persons thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants believe that a bank, bank holding company, or affiliated person thereof that is affiliated with a Fund
solely because it owns, holds, or controls 5% or more of the Fund's outstanding voting securities and/or acts as investment
adviser to a different Fund, although an ``affiliated person'' of the Fund, or an ``affiliated person of an affiliated
person'' of the Fund, within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act, is unlikely to possess the power to influence
improperly the Fund with respect to purchases or sales by the Fund of securities from or to an Affiliated Bank. As a condition
to the order, no Fund will engage in transactions with any Affiliated Bank which serves as investment adviser or sponsor
to that Fund, controls or is under common control with the investment adviser or sponsor, or otherwise controls such
Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9). Applicants believe that permitting transactions only with remote affiliates
precludes the possibility of any overreaching by an Affiliated Bank and thus eliminates the concerns that section
17(a) was designed to address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section 17(e)(1) prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person thereof,
from accepting any compensation for acting as an agent for the investment company unless it is in the course of such
person's business as an underwriter or broker. Section 17(e)(2) provides that an affiliated person of a registered
investment company, or an affiliated person thereof, acting as a broker or underwriter for the registered investment
company may accept a limited commission or fee for conducting such transactions. Because banks are specifically
excluded from the definition of broker in section 2(a)(6), however, they are unable to accept compensation under

6. Applicants believe that the execution of transactions through Affiliated Banks as agents is appropriate for a
number of reasons. First, any such transactions will comply with section 17(e)(2), assuring that the compensation
received is fair and reasonable. Second, granting the relief merely would put an Affiliated Bank in the same position
as any other affiliated person of a Fund that happened to meet the definition of broker. Finally, the use of Affiliated
Banks promotes investment flexibility by expanding the range of entities available for execution of securities
transactions.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Funds will engage in transactions with Affiliated Banks only in U.S. government securities or Qualified Securities,
For purposes hereof, the term Qualified Securities is defined to mean:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For obligations which are ``short-term'' securities within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, each
such security shall constitute an ``Eligible Security'' within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7; provided, that in
the case of Unrated Securities (as defined in rule 2a&hyph;7(a)(20)), in addition to the requirements of rule 2a&hyph;7
applicable to such Unrated Securities, all determinations with respect to comparability of such securities to rated
securities are also reviewed and approved at least quarterly by a majority of a Fund's board of directors/ trustees
who are not interested persons of the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For obligations which are ``long-term'' securities within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7, each such security
(or another long-term security of the same issuer having comparable priority and security to such obligation) shall
have been rated by a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization (``NRSRO'') in one of the four highest
rating categories for long-term obligations; or, if the security and issuer have not been rated by any NRSRO, are determined
by a Fund's investment adviser to be comparable in credit quality to a security carrying a long-term rating in one of
such four highest rating categories of a NRSRO, and such determination is reviewed and approved at least quarterly
by a majority of such Fund's board of directors/ trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund. In addition, if
a Fund proposes to invest in a security that at the time of issuance was a long-term security but that has a remaining
maturity of 397 calendar days or less, then the issuer of such security shall have received a rating from a NRSRO, with
respect to a class of short-term securities that is comparable in priority and security to the long-term security,
in one of the two highest rating categories. If the issuer has not received such a rating with regard to comparable short-term
securities, then a long-term security with a remaining maturity of less than 397 calendar days is not eligible unless
it has a long-term rating from a NRSRO within the two highest rating categories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any repurchase agreements will be ``collateralized fully'' within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) For obligations subject to unconditional, irrevocable credit enhancement (including, without limitation,
a guarantee, letter of credit, or put), the Funds may rely upon the NRSRO ratings of the provider of such credit enhancement
to determine whether the obligation satisfies the requirements of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. Such obligations
shall be treated as rated securities to the extent that the credit enhancement is of comparable priority and security
to the rated obligations of the provider of such credit enhancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. No Fund will engage in transactions with an Affiliated Bank that exercises a controlling influence over that Fund
(and ``controlling influence'' shall be deemed to include, but is not limited to, directly or indirectly, owning,
controlling or holding more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund). Further, no Fund will engage
in a transaction in Qualified Securities with an Affiliated Bank that is an investment adviser or sponsor to that Fund,
or an Affiliated Bank controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such investment adviser or sponsor.
No Fund will purchase obligations of any Affiliated Bank (other than repurchase agreements) if, as a result, more
than 5% of that Fund's total assets would be invested in obligations of that Affiliated Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Each Fund: (a) Will maintain and preserve permanently in an easily accessible place a written copy of the procedures
(and any modifications thereto) described in condition 8; and (b) will maintain and preserve for a period of not less
than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transactions occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible
place, a written record of each such transaction setting forth a description of the security purchased or sold, the
identity of the person on the other side of the transaction, the terms of the purchase or sale transaction, and the information
or material upon which the determinations described below were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. The security to be purchased or sold by a Fund will be consistent with the investment objectives and policies of that
Fund as recited in the registration statement relating to the Fund, and will be consistent with the interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. Further, the security to be purchased or sold by that Fund must be comparable in terms of
quality, yield, and maturity to other similar securities that are appropriate for the Fund and that are being purchased
or sold during a comparable period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 5. The terms of the transactions will be reasonable and fair to the shareholders of a Fund and will not involve overreaching
of the Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned. In considering whether the price to be paid or received
for the security is reasonable and fair, the price of the security will be analyzed with respect to comparable transactions
involving similar securities being purchased or sold during a comparable period of time. In making this analysis,
the board of directors/trustees may rely on a matrix pricing system which they believe properly assists them in determining
the value of the securities pursuant to section 2(a)(41)(ii) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 6. Before any transaction in U.S. government securities may be conducted pursuant to the exemption, the Fund involved
or its investment adviser must obtain such information as they deem necessary to determine that the price to be paid
or received for the security is at least as favorable as that from other sources. The Fund or its investment adviser
must obtain and document competitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to the specific proposed
U.S. government securities transaction, except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers, only one
other competitive quotation is required. With respect to prospective purchases of U.S. government securities,
these dealers must be those who have securities of the categories and the type desired in their inventories and who
are in a position to quote favorable prices with respect thereto. With respect to the prospective disposition of U.S.
government securities, these dealers must be those who, in the experience of the Fund and its investment adviser,
are in a position to quote favorable prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 7. The commission, fee spread, or other remuneration to be received by the Affiliated Bank as dealer will be reasonable
and fair compared to the commission, fee, spread, or other remuneration received by other brokers or dealers in connection
with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold during a comparable period of
time but in no event will such fee, commission, spread or other remuneration exceed that which is stated in section
17(e)(2) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 8. The board of directors/trustees of each of the Funds: (a) Will adopt procedures, pursuant to which transactions
may be effected for the Funds, which are reasonably designed to provide that the conditions in the foregoing paragraphs
and the requirements of Investment Company Act Release No. 13005 (Feb. 2, 1983) have been compiled with; (b) will make
and approve such changes as deemed necessary; and (c) will determine no less frequently than quarterly that such transactions
made during the preceding quarter were effected in compliance with such procedures. These procedures will also be
approved by a majority of the non-interested members of each board of directors/trustees. The investment adviser
to each Fund will implement these procedures and make decisions necessary to meet these conditions, subject to the
direction and control of the board of directors/trustees of the relevant Fund.

Applicants' Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each of the Funds is a Maryland corporation that is registered under the Act as an open-end, management investment
company. Two of the Funds (the ``Money Market Funds'') are offered to the public at net asset value with no sales charge.
The other Funds (the ``Load Funds'') are offered to the public at net asset value plus a sales charge. Each Load Fund
has adopted a distribution plan (the ``Distribution Plan'') under rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act, which permits each
Load Fund to pay the Distributor up to 0.25% of that Fund's average daily net assist value on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and serves as the investment
adviser of each of the Funds. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Distributor. The Distributor is an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company. The Distributor, a registered broker-dealer,
serves as the principal underwriter for each of the Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants seek to implement multi-class distribution arrangements (the ``Multi-Class System'') for each of
the Funds. Under the Multi-Class System, each Fund will issue two classes of shares. All shares outstanding as of the
time of implemention of the Multi-Class System will be designated as ``Class A'' shares. The offering price of Class
A shares of a Load Fund purchased in amounts of less than $1 million will be net asset value plus a front-end sales charge.
Class A shares of the Load Funds will be subject to the Distribution Plan currently in effect, as modified to accommodate
the mutli-class structure. Class A shares of the Money Market Funds will be sold at net asset value, and will not be subject
to a Distribution Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under the Multi-Class System, each Fund will create an additional class of shares designated as ``Class B'' shares.
Class B shares will be subject to a Distribution Plan fee of 1% of average daily net assets on an annual basis, of which
up to 0.25% will be paid to dealers' registered representatives as a service fee. The remainder of the Distribution
Plan fee on Class B shares will be used primarily to reimburse the Distributor for commissions paid to dealers and registered
representatives in connection with sales of Class B shares. Class B shares of the Money Market Funds can be acquired
only through exchanges for Class B shares of other Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Class B shares also will be subject to a CDSC of up to 4% for a period of six years. The amount of any CDSC imposed upon
a redemption of Class B shares will be computed as a percentage of the lesser of the value of the redeemed shares at the
time of purchase or their value at redemption. The holding period and amount of the CDSC, and the magnitude of the purchases
to which it applies are each subject to change. No CDSC will be imposed on Class B shares: (a) Purchased with reinvested
income dividends or capital gains distributions, (b) purchased more than six years prior to the date of the redemption,
or (c) acquired through an exchange for other Class B shares, if the exchanged Class B shares would not have been assessed
a CDSC upon redemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants proposed to waive any CDSC that otherwise would be applicable to a redemption of Class B shares in connection
with shares redeemed: (a) Due to the death or disability, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code''), of
a shareholder; (b) from retirement plans to satisfy minimum distribution rules under the Code; (c) to pay surrender
charges; (d) to pay retirement plan fees; (e) involuntarily from small balance accounts (values of less than $300);
(f) through a systematic withdrawal plan that permits 10% of the value of a shareholder's Class B shares of a particular
Fund on January 1 of each year to be withdrawn automatically in equal monthly installments throughout the year without
payment of the otherwise applicable CDSC; or (g) from a retirement plan to assure the plan complies with section 401(k)
and 401(m) of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Class A shares of the Load Funds will be sold with no sales charge to persons who reinvest, within 60 days, the proceeds
of redemptions of Class B shares of the Load Funds on which the CDSC was waived because of the death or disability of the
original shareholder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Any Class B shares purchased will convert automatically to Class A shares seven years after the end of the month of
the date of their purchase. At the same time, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of all shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends and distributions will convert into Class A shares,
with that portion determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Class B shares converting into Class A shares bears
to the shareholder's total Class B shares not acquired through dividends and distributions. The conversion of Class
B shares into Class A shares will be subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service
private letter ruling to the effect that the conversion does not constitute a taxable event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Exchanges for shares of another Fund generally will be permitted only for shares of the same class. However, to facilitate
automatic exchanges used by some investors to effect a dollar-cost averaging strategy, Class B shares of the Load
Funds may be acquired in exchange for Class A shares of Princor Cash Management Fund, Inc. that were purchased without
payment of a sales load. All exchanges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Under the Multi-Class System, all expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated among the classes of shares of such
Fund based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each
class will reflect the Distribution Plan expenses (if any) and any expenses attributable to the class as set forth
in condition 1 below (``Class Expenses''). Expenses allocated to a particular class of shares of a Fund will be borne
on a proportionate basis by each outstanding share of that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. From time to time, a Fund may create additional classes of shares of beneficial interest, the terms of which may
differ from the classes described herein only in the following respects: (a) Each new class of shares might have a different
designation; (b) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under a Distribution Plan; (c) each new class of
shares will hold any voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting that class, except as provided in condition
14 below; (d) each new class of shares will bear Class Expenses specifically attributable to the particular class;
(e) each new class of shares will have different exchange privileges; and (f) certain classes may have a conversion
feature. Applicants also may charge different sales loads on different classes of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants will comply with applicable portions of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), including in particular the portions of Rule 26 that relate to sales loads, asset-based
sales charges and service fees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 18 is designed to prohibit material differences among the rights of shareholders in a fund, including abuses
resulting from complex capital structures (such as excessive leverage, conflicts of interest among classes, and
investor confusion), and discriminatory shareholder voting provisions. Applicants request an exemptive order
to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class System might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning
of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and violate the equal voting provisions of
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants assert that the Multi-Class System would present none of the abuses addressed by section 18. No leverage
would result from the issuance or purchase of different classes of shares. Mutuality of risk would be preserved, and
each class of Fund shares would be redeemable at all times. No class of shares of a Fund would have any distribution or
liquidation preference with respect to particular assets, and no class would be protected by any reserve or other
account. Investors would not be given misleading impressions about the safety or risk of any class of shares, because
the similarities and ifferences of the classes of shares would be disclosed in the prospectuses and statements of
additional information describing the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants also request an exemption from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the
Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of
shares and to waive the CDSC in certain instances.

Applicants' Conditions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of that Fund and will
be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same
Fund will relate solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Fund; (b) the impact of the disproportionate
payments made under the Distribution Plan; (c) different Class Expenses for each class of shares, which are limited
to: (i) Transfer agency fees identified by the transfer agent of the Funds as being attributable to a specific class;
(ii) blue sky registration fees incurred with respect to a class of shares; (iii) SEC registration fees incurred with
respect to a class of shares; (iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to provide services
to the shareholders of a specific class; (v) litigation or other legal expenses, or audit or other accounting expenses
relating solely to one class of shares; (vi) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of
shares; and (vii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder
reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a given class; (d) the voting rights as to matters exclusively
affecting one class of shares (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the adoption, amendment or termination of a Distribution Plan) except as provided in condition 14 below; (e) different
exchange privileges; and (f) certain classes may have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses
not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one
class of shares will not be so allocated unless and until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the creation and issuance
of any new classes of shares in their respective Funds. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds
regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to add or change a class of shares
will reflect in detail the reason for the directors' determination that such an addition or change is in the best interests
of the Funds and their respective shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares offered by each Fund. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such
action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the
Adviser and the Distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such a conflict, up to and including establishing one or
more new registered management investment companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures under any distribution or servicing plan, in compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule
12b&hyph;1 under the Act, as amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify the Distribution Plan fee charged to
that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors
to justify any fee charged to shareholders of that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they
are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary
duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Dividends paid by a Fund regarding its various classes of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Distribution Plan fee
payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class, and any Class Expenses
attributable solely to one class will be borne exclusively by that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of multiple
classes, and the proper allocation of expenses among them has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''), who has
rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon that review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to those reports,
following a request by a Fund (which each Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff
upon the written request to a Fund for those work papers by a senior member of the SEC's Division of Investment Management,
limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant
Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the
Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on
policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,'' as defined and described in
Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''),
as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares, and the proper allocation of
expenses among the various classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the initial report
referred to in condition 6 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on
an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 6 above. Applicants will take immediate
corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The prospectus of each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation with respect
to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards for determining when each class of shares may appropriately be
sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to conform to those
standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted, and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the various classes of shares will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to the
directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in each of its prospectuses
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of the Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it also will disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present each class
of shares separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to Distribution
Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net assets of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load,
fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or
service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that
in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the
conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. If a Fund implements any amendment to the Distribution Plan or other plan adopted under rule 12b&hyph;1 (or, if
presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a ``non-rule 12b&hyph;1'' shareholder services
plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by a Target Class under the plan, then Purchase Class
shares will stop converting into shares of that Target Class, unless Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately
as a class, approve the amendment. The directors shall take any action necessary to ensure that existing Purchase
Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material
respects to Target Class shares as they existed prior to implementation of the amendment, no later than the date those
Purchase Class shares were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to
implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class
(``New Purchase Class'') of shares, identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects, except
that the new Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class and New Purchase Class may be
formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected
in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition
3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or New Purchase
Class shares shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation
of the amendment may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material
features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of that plan to the Purchase Class are disclosed in an effective
registration statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of the Funds, including a majority
of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by the Funds to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of directors and the directors shall review, at least
quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which those expenditures were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, as that rule is currently
stated in Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or modified
in the future.

Applicants' Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Western Southern, a stock life insurance company organized under Ohio law, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Western
and Southern Life Insurance Company, a mutual life insurance company also organized under Ohio law. Western Southern
serves as the sponsor and the depositor of the Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Account, established by Western Southern on July 27, 1992 as a separate investment account of Western Southern
under Ohio law, will be used to support certain variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'') and for other lawful
purposes. The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The application
incorporates by reference the registration statement, currently on file with the Commission (File No. 33&hyph;76582),
for the Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of IFS Financial Services, Inc. (``IFS Financial''), is the distribution
of the Contracts. IFS Financial is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Southern. Interactive is registered as a broker-dealer
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts are flexible payment, tax-deferred variable annuities available to both individual investors
and group plans on either a nonqualified (``Nonqualified Contract'') or qualified (``Qualified Contract'') basis.
Qualified Contracts qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment under Sections 401, 403 or 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Nonqualified Contracts require a minimum initial purchase payment of $2000. Qualified Contracts require a minimum
initial purchase payment of $1000. Subsequent purchase payments under both types of Contracts may be made at any time
and must be at least $100. Maximum cumulative total of all purchase payments under any Contract may not exceed $500,000
without the prior approval of Western Southern. Purchase payments may be allocated to the Account, to the general
account (the ``Fixed Account'') of Western Southern, or, to a combination of the Account and the Fixed Account.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Account has seven subaccounts, each of which invest in shares of an investment portfolio of either The IFS Variable
Insurance Trust (the ``IFS Trust'') or The Select Advisers Portfolio (the ``SA Trust''). The IFS Trust, a no load open-end
diversified investment management company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, consists of five portfolios
available through the subaccounts for investment of funds allocated by Contract owners to the Account. The SA Trust,
a no load open-end diversified investment management company organized as a business trust, has two portfolios available
for investment by Contract owners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Contracts permit transfers among the subaccounts of the Account and between the Account and the Fixed Account.
There is currently no charge for transfers although Western Southern reserves the right to impose such a charge in
the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Western Southern reserves the right to impose a deduction for premium taxes when the applicable jurisdiction imposes
the tax liability. The application states that the applicable premium taxes depend upon the Contract owner's then
current place of residence and generally range from 0 to 3% of purchase payments or of the amount annuitized. Applicants
state that Western Southern will not make a profit on premium taxes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants impose an annual Contract maintenance charge of $35 per Contract and this charge is deducted from the
Contract value. A Contract administration charge is also deducted and this charge is deducted as a percentage of and
from the assets of the Account of an annual effective rate of .15%. Western Southern represents that the administrative
charges will not increase for the life of the Contracts. Western Southern represents that it does not expect that the
total revenues from the administrative charges will exceed the expected costs of administering the Contracts. Further,
Applicants state that Western Southern will monitor the relationship of the administrative expenses and the proceeds
collected from the administrative expenses and the proceeds collected from the administrative charges for compliance
with Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% of the amount withdrawn is imposed upon total
surrender, partial withdrawal or commencement of an annuity payment option within the first seven years of the Contract.
The Sales Charge is a percentage of the amount of each purchase payment that is withdrawn. The percentage declines
depending upon how many years have passed since the withdrawn purchase payment was originally credited to a Contract
owner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Western Southern will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.20% of the value of the net assets
of the Account to compensate for Western Southern bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with
the Contracts. Approximately .80% of the 1.20% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40%
is attributable to expense risk. Applicants represent that the charge for mortality and expense risks will not increase.
If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover assumed costs and expenses, Western Southern will
bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to Western Southern. If Western
Southern realizes a gain from the charge for mortality and expense risks, the amount of such gain will be placed in the
general account of Western Southern and may be used in its discretion, including for payment of a portion of the costs
relating to the distribution of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Western Southern is threefold. First, Western Southern assumes
a mortality risk because of its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit in a lump sum (which sum may also be taken
in the form of an annuity payment option) upon the death of an annuitant prior to the date on which annuity payments are
scheduled to begin. Second, Western Southern assumes a mortality risk because of its agreement not to impose any surrender
charge or any other charge on the death benefit. Finally, Western Southern assumes a mortality risk because of its
contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity payment
options involving life contingencies, thereby assuring each annuitant that neither the annuitant's longevity
nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on annuity payments received under the
Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Western Southern is the risk that the administrative charges,
which are guaranteed not to increase under outstanding Contracts, will be insufficient to cover actual administrative
expenses.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality
and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit
investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates
unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian
and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not
exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative
services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.

2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable compensation for the risks assumed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.20% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Western Southern is
within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation
is based upon their analysis of publicly available information regarding products of other companies, taking into
consideration such factors as: Guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed annuity purchase rates; minimum
initial and subsequent purchase payments; other contract charges and the manner in which such charges are imposed;
investment options available under other contracts; and the availability of other contracts to individual qualified
and nonqualified plans. Applicants represent that Western Southern will maintain at its principal office, available
to the Commission upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed and the
methodology and results of Western Southern's comparative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants acknowledge that the Sales Charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution
of the Contracts and that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such
profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the Sales Charge. Applicants represent that Western
Southern has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangement
will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will
be maintained by Western Southern at its principal office and will be made available to the Commission upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Western Southern also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have
such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons
of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act.

Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is a registered open-end investment company that offers ten series: The Jamestown Balanced Fund, The
Jamestown Equity Fund, The Jamestown Bond Fund, The Jamestown Short Term Bond Fund, The Jamestown Tax Exempt Virginia
Fund, FBP Contrarian Balanced Fund, FBP Contrarian Equity Fund, the Alabama Tax Free Bond Fund, The Government Street
Bond Fund, and the Government Street Equity Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Advisors are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Each Fund is advised
by one of the Advisors. One or more of the Advisors (or a successor entity) will serve as the investment adviser to the
Future Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Each series of the Trust is authorized, and the Future Funds will be authorized, by their investment policies to
invest in repurchase agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Fund has or may be expected to have uninvested cash balances with its custodian bank which otherwise would not
be invested in portfolio securities by its Advisor at the end of each trading day. In the normal course of business,
such assets are or would be invested in overnight repurchase agreements with a bank or major brokerage house collateralized
by U.S. Government securities in order to earn additional income. Every morning each Advisor, on behalf of the Funds
it serves, begins negotiating the interest rate for repurchase agreements for that day and lining up securities required
as collateral. Generally, some portion of the assets in the respective account of each Fund is received too late, or
is too small, to be invested effectively in a separate transaction. Further, because each Fund must separately pursue,
secure, and implement such investments, there is a duplication of effort that results in certain inefficiencies
and may limit the return which some or all Funds can achieve.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Applicants seek a conditional order permitting the Funds to deposit their daily uninvested cash balances into
a single joint account, the daily balance of which would be used to enter into one or more overnight (or weekend or holiday)
repurchase agreements. The requested order will maximize the return by minimizing economic and administrative
efficiencies by allowing the Funds to enter into large repurchase agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each repurchase agreement will be made by calling a government securities dealer and indicating the rate of interest
and size of the desired repurchase agreement. Particular securities to be held as collateral will then be identified
and the Fund's custodian bank will be notified. The securities will be wired to the account of the custodian bank at
the proper Federal Reserve Bank, transferred to a sub-custodian account of the Funds at another qualified bank, or
redesignated and segregated on the records of the custodian bank if the custodian bank is already the record holder
of the collateral for the repurchase agreement. The Funds will not enter into repurchase agreements with the custodian
bank, except where cash is received very late in the business day and otherwise would be unavailable for investment
at all.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Each of the Funds has established the same systems and standards, including quality standards for issuers of repurchase
agreements and for collateral, and requirements that the repurchase agreements will be ``collateralized fully,''
as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act. Identical systems and standards will be adopted by any Future
Funds which invest in the proposed joint account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(d) makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated
person of such person, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which such registered investment company
is a joint or a joint and several participant with such person in contravention of rules and regulations which the Commission
prescribes for the purpose of preventing participation by such company on a basis different from or less advantageous
than that of other participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Rule 17d&hyph;1 provide that no affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person
of such person, acting as principal, shall participate in, or effect any transaction in connection with, any joint
enterprise or other joint arrangement in which such registered investment company is a participant unless an application
regarding such joint arrangement has been filed with the Commission and has been granted an order. In passing upon
such applications, the Commission will consider whether the investment company's participation in the proposed
joint enterprise or arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent
to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Each Fund might be deemed an affiliated person of each other Fund under section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Each Fund, by participating
in the proposed account, and the Advisors, by managing the proposed account, could be deemed to be a ``joint participant''
in a ``transaction'' within the meaning of section 17(d), and the proposed account could be deemed to be a ``joint enterprise
or other joint series issue arrangement'' within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed account will not be distinguished from any other account maintained by the Funds with their custodian
bank except that monies from the Funds could be deposited in the proposed account on a commingled basis. The sole function
of this account will be to provide a convenient way of aggregating what otherwise would be the individual daily transactions
for each Fund necessary to manage the daily uninvested cash balances of each Fund. Each Fund will participate in the
account on the same basis as every other Fund. The Adviser will have no monetary participation in the account, but will
be responsible for investing amounts in the account, establishing control procedures, and ensuring the equal treatment
of each Fund. The proposed method of operating the account will not result in any conflicts of interest between any
of the Funds, or between a Fund and its Advisor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Funds will benefit from the proposed arrangement because, on any given day and under most market conditions,
it is possible to negotiate a rate of return on large repurchase agreements which is greater than the rate of return
available for smaller repurchase agreements. In addition, by reducing the number of trade tickets, repurchase transactions
will be simplified and the opportunity for errors will be reduced. Each Fund will also benefit from the fact that an
institution entering into a very large repurchase agreement is almost always able and willing to increase the amount
covered by such agreement near the end of the day, which possibility may not exist with smaller repurchase agreements.
Moreover, without a joint account, some Funds may find that they will be unable to invest in repurchase agreements
because their respective daily cash balances would not meet the minimum investment requirement for a repurchase
agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants assert that granting the requested relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants
further assert that participation in the proposed joint account by each Fund would not be on a basis different from
or less advantageous that of any other Fund participant and that the participation by the Advisors will be ministerial
only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As express conditions to the granting of the requested relief, applicants agree that the joint repurchase account
will operate as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A separate custodian cash account will be established into which each Fund will cause its uninvested net cash balances
to be deposited daily. The joint account will not be distinguished from any other accounts maintained by a Fund with
its custodian bank except that monies from a Fund will be deposited on a commingled basis. The account will not have
any separate existence or have any indicia of a separate legal entity. The sole function of the account will be to provide
a convenient way to aggregating individual transactions which would otherwise require daily management by each
Fund of its uninvested cash balance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cash in the account will be invested solely in repurchase agreements with a duration not to exceed one business day
and collateralized by suitable U.S. Government securities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the government of the United States or by any of its
agencies or instrumentalities) and satisfying the uniform standards set by the Funds for such investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. All securities held by the joint account will be valued on an amortized cost basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Fund relying upon rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act for valuation of its net assets on the basis of amortized cost
will use the average maturity of the repurchase agreements purchased by the Funds participating in the account for
the purpose of computing the Fund's average portfolio maturity with respect to the portion of its assets held in such
account on that day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. In order to assure that there will be no opportunity for one Fund to use any part of a balance of the account credited
to another Fund, no Fund will be allowed to create a negative balance in the account for any reason, although a Fund will
be permitted to draw down its entire balance at any time; each Fund shall retain the sole rights of ownership of any of
its assets, including interest payable on the assets invested in the account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each Fund will participate in the net income earned or accrued in the account on the basis of the percentage of the
total amount in the account on any day represented by its share of the account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Each Advisor will administer the investment of the cash balance in and the operation of the account as part of its
duties under its existing or any future investment advisory contract with each Fund and will not collect any additional
fees for management of the account. The Advisors will collect their fees based upon the assets of each separate Fund
as provided in each respective investment advisory agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Each Fund's decision to invest in the account shall be solely at the Fund's option and no Fund shall be obligated to
invest or to maintain any minimum amount in the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Each Fund's investment in the account shall be documented daily on the books of each Fund as well as on the books of
the Fund's custodian bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. All repurchase agreements will have an overnight, over-the-weekend, or over-a-holiday duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Funds will enter into an agreement with each other to govern the arrangements in accordance with the foregoing
principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The administration of the account will be within the fidelity bond coverage required by section 17(g) of the Act
and rule 17g&hyph;1 thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The trustees of the Trust and the boards of directors of any Future Funds participating in the joint account shall
evaluate the joint account arrangement annually, and shall continue the account only if they determine that there
is a reasonable likelihood that the account will benefit the Funds and their shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. All joint repurchase agreement transactions will be effected in accordance with Investment Company Act Release
No. 13005 (Feb. 2, 1983) and with other existing and future positions taken by the Commission or its staff by rule, interpretive
release, no-action letter, any release adopting any new rule, or any release adopting any amendments to any existing
rule.

The authority vested in the Commissioner of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue by Treasury Order Nos. 150&hyph;04, 150&hyph;09 and 150&hyph;10 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority contained in 26 U.S.C. &amp; 7121 is hereby delegated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All District Directors, Examination division chiefs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination branch chiefs, and Examination case managers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegated discretionary authority under section 7121 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code to accept settlement offers, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of liability sought to be compromised, with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rollover and recurring issues in Coordinated Examination Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases where a settlement on the merits has been effected by Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the same taxpayer in a previous or subsequent tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. Prior to finalization, the proposed settlement, together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any related closing agreement or Form 870AD, shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantively reviewed and approved by the appropriate branch chief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the Examination function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For purposes of this delegation of limited settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, the terms ``rollover'' and ``recurring'' issues are defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A ``rollover'' issue involves an adjustment arising from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same legal issue in the same transaction or taxable event and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts more than one tax period. For example, the rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amortization or depreciation of an asset, bad debt losses, basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and inventory adjustments and the like, when related to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction and which affect future tax periods, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible to case manager settlement where a settlement on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merits has been reached in Appeals in a previous tax period with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the same taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A ``recurring'' issue involves an adjustment arising from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same legal issue in a separate transaction or a repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable event in which the taxpayer advances the same legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position with respect to such similar transaction or repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable event as advanced by such taxpayer in a prior tax period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the method of depreciation with respect to similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets, the use of the same accounting method with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar transactions, the annual computation of such deductions as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depletion, the computation of certain tax credits and the like, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when advanced by the same taxpayer in later tax periods would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible to case manager settlement where a settlement on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merits has been reached by Appeals in a previous tax period with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the same taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No settlement shall be effected unless the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors are present in the tax year currently under Examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The facts surrounding a transaction or taxable event in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax period under examination, including the relative amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at issue, are substantially the same as the facts in the settled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The underlying issue must have been settled on its merits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently of other issues in a previous or subsequent tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period by Appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The legal authority relating to such issue must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remained unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The issue must have been settled in Appeals with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the same taxpayer (including consolidated and unconsolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiaries) in a previous tax period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. All District Directors, Examination division chiefs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination branch chiefs, and Examination case managers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegated authority to execute closing agreements and the Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
870AD in order to effect any final settlement reached with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any rollover or recurring issue in a Coordinated Examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The authority delegated in this Order may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redelegated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The authority contained in this Order is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement the authority contained in Delegation Order No. 97 (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended).

By the authority vested in me as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, under sections 1323 and 1326 of the Federal
Housing Enterprise Financial Safety and Soundness Act, 12 U.S.C. 4543 and 4546, I have determined that certain information,
identified in the attached Exhibit A, contained in the loan-level data files which were submitted by the Federal National
Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
as required under the Interim Housing Goals, should be deemed proprietary information. Accordingly, under the authority
of section 1326 of the Act, I hereby order that this information be withheld from public disclosure at this time. The
basis and terms of this Temporary Order are set forth fully below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Housing Enterprise Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, enacted as Title XIII of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1992, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992), codified generally at 12 U.S.C.
4501&hyph;4561 (``the Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Secretary to establish and monitor the performance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in meeting annual goals
for mortgage purchases on housing for low- and moderate-income families, housing located in central cities, and
special affordable housing, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families.
On October 13, 1993, the Secretary published the housing goals and requirements for the GSEs' mortgage purchases
for the 1993&hyph;94 transition period in Notices of Interim Housing Goals (``the Notices''). 58 FR 53047&hyph;53096.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Notices, the Secretary required the GSEs to submit certain data on their mortgage purchases by March 1, 1994.
This information is to assist the Secretary in monitoring the GSEs' performance under the goals and to satisfy the
requirements of subsections 309(m)&hyph;(n) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, 12 U.S.C.
1723a(m)&hyph;(n), and subsections 307(e)&hyph;(f) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act, 12 U.S.C.
1456(e)&hyph;(f). Sections 309(m) and 307(e) under these Acts mandate that the GSEs collect, maintain and provide
to the Secretary data relating to their mortgages on single family and multifamily housing and sections 309(n) and
307(f) require that the GSEs report aggregate information on their mortgages to Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Notices, the Secretary required each GSE to provide information in two forms_loan-level data files that
provide detailed information on each mortgage loan purchased by the GSE, and data reports that aggregate data on mortgage
loans in various ways. In addition, the Secretary required each GSE to provide a written report discussing its performance
under the housing goals. The information required in the loan-level data files includes detailed information on
individual loans purchased by the GSEs including: The borrower(s') annual income, race, and gender; census tract;
other geographic identifiers; loan-to-value ratio; number of units; owner-occupancy status; and other details
on the mortgage, the property, and the borrower(s). The information required for the data reports includes aggregate
data concerning: The amount of mortgage purchases that qualify towards each housing goal, classified by number of
units and dollar volume; mortgagors' income; race; location of property; and various other categories.

Section 1323 of the Act, 12 U.S.C. 4543, provides that the Secretary shall make available to the public the data submitted
by the GSEs in the reports required under section 309(m) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act
and section 307(e) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the data that the Secretary determines by regulation or order pursuant to section 1326, 12 U.S.C. 4546, is proprietary.
Section 1323(b)(2) of the Act, 12 U.S.C. 4543(b)(2), specifically provides that the Secretary may not restrict access
to data consisting of income, census tract location, race, and gender of mortgagors of single family properties.
Section 1326 provides that the Secretary may by regulation or order provide that certain information shall be treated
as proprietary and, pending the issuance of a final decision on the matter, the material may not be disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under Exemption 4, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), allows confidential business information
to be protected from disclosure, and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, forbids Government officers and employees
from releasing trade secret and other confidential business information. Executive Order No. 12,600, 3 CFR at 235
(1988), requires that agencies notify submitters of confidential business information of requests under FOIA for
such information and that agencies afford submitters an opportunity to comment on release of the requested information.
If an agency determines to release notwithstanding a submitted objection, the Executive Order requires that the
agency notify the submitter reasonably prior to release. The President of the United States, by memorandum, dated
October 4, 1993, to Heads of Departments and Agencies, emphasized the importance of public disclosures under FOIA
and an implementing memorandum from the Attorney General, attached to the President's memorandum, instructed agencies
to disclose information unless disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. The President's
and the Attorney General's memoranda do not alter Executive Order No. 12,600.

In addition to the legal requirements respecting proprietary information, the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
and FOIA Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), pertain to the disclosure of information on individuals. Accordingly,
even if information is not withheld as proprietary, it still may be withheld pursuant to the Privacy Act or Exemption
6.

Information Regarded as Proprietary by the GSEs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to March 1, 1994, Departmental staff met separately with staff of each GSE to discuss the subject of proprietary
information in view of the impending deadline for receipt of materials by HUD in accordance with the Notices. Fannie
Mae staff advised that, notwithstanding that it considered most of the information submitted under the Notice to
be proprietary, Fannie Mae sought for HUD to withhold only certain data from the loan-level data files because, if
released, such data would cause substantial competitive harm to Fannie Mae.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both GSEs pointed out that, because the Act requires the Secretary to release information on census tract location
of properties, releasing other details on specific loans such as unpaid principal balance (UPB), date of mortgage
note, loan type, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and similar terms would cause competitive harm by permitting the other
GSE or other market competitors to gain competitive advantage from the information. For example the GSEs argue that:
Releasing loan-level information on each properties' UPB and census tract location will reveal what size loans a
GSE is willing to buy in a particular area, at what prices and on what terms, and that such information will assist competitors
in the same market and other markets. Likewise, customers will use the information to obtain insight into each GSEs'
pricing and marketing strategies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Correspondence from the GSEs details the GSEs' objections to release of items in the loan-level data files. This correspondence,
attached to and incorporated in this Notice of Temporary Order, includes: Exhibit B_a letter from Anthony F. Marra,
Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Fannie Mae, to Kenneth A. Markison, Assistant General Counsel
for Administrative Law, dated March 11, 1994; and Exhibit C_a letter from Allan G. Ratner, Vice President and Deputy
General Counsel of Freddie Mac, to Mr. Markison, dated May 9, 1994. This correspondence lists the particular data
items that each GSE requested be withheld.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freddie Mac requested the withholding of more items than Fannie Mae. Both GSEs requested that the Secretary treat
the GSEs' information the same so that any information deemed proprietary for one GSE is deemed proprietary for the
other GSE. Accordingly, where only one GSE requested proprietary treatment for a particular category of information,
this Temporary Order provides that such information is treated as proprietary for both GSEs. Exhibit A identifies
the items requested to be withheld as proprietary: Solely by Freddie Mac (marked with an ``*''); solely by Fannie Mae
(marked with ``**''); and by both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (unmarked).

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will comply fully with the requirements of the Act and will make available to the public data submitted
to HUD by the GSEs, consisting of income, census tract location, race, and gender of mortgagors of single family properties.
However, having considered the views of the GSEs concerning the disclosure of the remainder of the data and the statutory
requirements concerning withholding proprietary information, it is concluded that a Temporary Order is necessary
to protect other information submitted by the GSEs, not in the foregoing categories, which the GSEs regard as proprietary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of the Act characterizes the lack of information on the GSEs' performance as ``an information
vacuum.'' S. Rep. No. 102&hyph;282, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 39 (1992). The legislative history notes that ``public access
and disclosure of information is a key tool for permitting appropriate public scrutiny and oversight of the activities
of the [GSEs] and in evaluating possible improvements in housing finance markets.''

. at 44. On the other hand, the Act also protects proprietary information from release. Based on the submissions of
both GSEs, the information in the attached Exhibit A shall be deemed proprietary. The Secretary further concludes,
however, that: This Order should be temporary; the public should be accorded full opportunity to comment during the
regulatory process; and this Temporary Order should expire no later than the date regulations fully addressing this
subject are effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Temporary Order does not extend to aggregated data information in the data reports and the written reports submitted
by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Such data are not regarded as causing substantial competitive harm by the GSEs and, at
such time as this information is requested by the public, it will be released. Even though loan-level information
is not deemed proprietary under this Temporary Order, other statutes, including the Privacy Act of 1974 and Exemption
6 of FOIA, may pertain and result in withholding of information.

Expiration and Modification of This Temporary Order

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Temporary Order shall be effective until such time as it is determined necessary and/or appropriate to withdraw
or modify it. Final GSE regulations will fully address the disclosure and withholding of information under the Act
and this Temporary Order will, in any event, expire when the final regulations are published. Pending final regulations,
the Department will work with the GSEs to narrow the list of items withheld and develop ways that information deemed
proprietary under this Temporary Order may be released without disclosing proprietary information. This Temporary
Order may be modified if it is determined that additional information should be made available to the public. Any such
determination will be conducted in accordance with the Act. In any event, in responding to FOIA requests, the Department
will follow the procedures in Executive Order 12,600, as applicable.

If the Department receives a request on behalf of a Congressional Committee or Subcommittee, the Comptroller General,
a subpoena from a court of competent jurisdiction, or is otherwise compelled by law to release information determined
to be proprietary under this Temporary Order, the Department will provide the information in accordance with the
request without regard to the provisions of this Temporary Order. In releasing requested information under this
paragraph, the Department will include a statement with the information to the effect that the Secretary has determined
that the information is subject to this Temporary Order, the GSEs' regard the information as proprietary, and public
disclosure of the information may cause competitive harm to the GSEs. To the extent practical, the Department will
provide notice to the GSEs after a request under this paragraph is received and before the information is provided
in response to the request.

Re: Supplemental Information Regarding Confidentiality of Certain Data Submitted March 1, 1994 by Fannie Mae.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Dear Mr. Markison: This letter summarizes Fannie Mae's views on the issue of proprietary information contained in
its March 1 submission to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which contained tapes of loan level detail
relating to our purchase of single-family and multifamily mortgages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that all the information contained in the tapes submitted on March 1 is entitled to receive confidential
treatment, because it is the product of a substantial investment by Fannie Mae. Such information is not available
publicly and is treated as extremely confidential information and closely held within the corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in the spirit of providing HUD our fullest cooperation as it administers the new public disclosure provisions
of 12 U.S.C. 4543, Fannie Mae is requesting ``proprietary'' and ``confidential'' designations for only the elements
in the database that would advantage competitors or customers at our expense. These elements (only 23 of the 108 we
are providing) would, if disclosed, compromise our efficiency and competitive position in the market where we compete
day-to-day throughout the country with both Freddie Mac and highly innovative Wall Street firms. Disclosure of such
information would also hurt our bargaining position with companies with whom we conduct business. The specific elements
for which confidentiality is requested are listed and discussed in detail below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also request that HUD extend proprietary treatment reciprocally both to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so that any
element specifically deemed proprietary or confidential for one corporation would be deemed proprietary or confidential
also for the other, regardless of whether both firms specifically requested such treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4546(c), governing disclosure of proprietary information, we believe that HUD is required
to issue a final written decision regarding classification of our data submission as ``proprietary'' prior to releasing
any such information. This decision requirement is an express predicate for data disclosure under 12 U.S.C. 4543.
We believe that it also should govern any release under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, by
virtue of the enactment of 12 U.S.C. 4546 after FOIA, its greater specificity, and Congress' decision not to establish
any exception regarding FOIA requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it is our understanding that independent of its obligations under 12 U.S.C. 4546, HUD will observe the provisions
of Executive Order No. 12,600 (52 FR 23,781 (1987)) for all data that Fannie Mae classifies as proprietary and confidential
commercial or financial information. That Order recognizes the procedural rights of submitters of confidential
commercial data to the government, and mandates that a recipient agency provide notice and a reasonable response
time whenever the agency determines that it may be required to disclose the requested data. The Order further mandates
that if an agency overrules a submitter's objection, it must notify the submitter in writing and provide an explanation
of its decision. The agency must provide such an explanation a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure
date, to afford the submitter an opportunity to seek judicial relief if necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adherence to the procedures set forth in Executive Order No. 12,600 accords with existing arrangements between HUD
and Fannie Mae for treatment of confidential business information submitted by Fannie Mae as required by HUD regulations
(see letter dated February 15, 1979 from Irving Margulies, Acting HUD Deputy General Counsel, to Bernard Carl, Fannie
Mae's outside counsel). These arrangements have been in place for over 15 years and have provided a reasonable framework
for us to submit very sensitive business information to HUD. Last year, in response to a FOIA request, HUD had the opportunity
to implement the agreed-upon procedures for notification, and we were able to provide HUD with the reasons that certain
of the business information previously provided to HUD should continue to remain confidential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we request that HUD observe certain additional safeguards for requests from Congress regarding data identified
by Fannie Mae to be proprietary or confidential commercial information. In such cases, we request that HUD also provide
Fannie Mae with notice upon receipt of a congressional request for proprietary or confidential data, as well as notice
prior to HUD's delivery of requested data to Congress, to give us the opportunity to explain to Congress the need to
protect such data. We also request that HUD provide requested confidential data only when accompanied by a legend
stating that HUD has determined that the material is proprietary and exempt from public disclosure under both 5 U.S.C.
552 and 12 U.S.C. 4546, and that public disclosure would result in substantial competitive harm.

The basis for our request derives from the major precedents interpreting the FOIA's Exemption 4. The leading case
in determining whether information provided to the government is ``privileged and confidential'' and therefore
entitled to be withheld under Exemption 4 is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
National Parks,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the DC Circuit Court of Appeals held that the test for confidentiality is an objective one that could be determined
by a two prong test:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To summarize, commercial or financial matter is ``confidential'' for purposes of the exemption if disclosure of
the information is likely to have either of the following effects: (1) To impair the Government's ability to obtain
necessary information in the future; or (2) to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from
whom the information was obtained.

The second prong of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
National Parks
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 is applicable to each of the referenced items because, when combined with each other and with information on unpaid
principal balance (``UPB''), income, and precise geographic markers, disclosure would cause us substantial competitive
harm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public disclosure of the entire Single-Family Acquisitions database would provide customers and competitors with
the elements described above at loan level detail, in combination with loan amount, race, income, gender, zip code,
and census tract. Precise details on such factors as loan-to-value ratios, when combined with other basic loan level
detail, would likely cause substantial competitive injury to Fannie Mae by providing competitors and customers
with valuable insights about our business plans, risk assessments and marketing strategies. These insights could
lead to changes in pricing or negotiating tactics detrimental to the company.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The multifamily elements (contained in the Multifamily Acquisitions and Multifamily Units Files) that Fannie Mae
is classifying as proprietary and confidential are: Acquisition UPB; date of mortgage note; coop status; term at
origination; loan type (more properly, amortization); acquisition type; total number of units; average reported
rent per bedroom type; average reported rent plus utilities per bedroom type; purpose of loan, and zip code. Public
disclosure of this data would reveal key factors in our business strategies and successes to our competitors and companies
with whom we do business. This would subsidize such firms at our expense by providing them information they otherwise
could acquire only at great expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disclosing the referenced data for both single-family and multifamily elements would harm us by subsidizing the
competitors' acquisition of valuable market information, increasing their efficiency at Fannie Mae's expense.
Such consequences are precisely the type that courts have held justify non-disclosure of information under Exemption

Specifically, case law establishes that Exemption 4 is designed to protect a ``mosaic'' of data, to shield information
that might not cause competitive harm on a stand-alone basis, but would be harmful in combination with other information
available to the requester. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 491 F. Supp. 557, 559 (D.D.C. 1980). Under the precedents, information also must be deemed proprietary and confidential
if public disclosure would displace a submitter from a level competitive playing field_by forcing it to divulge sensitive
business information which competitors may access freely without incurring any parallel disclosure obligation
to the submitter of the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The courts thus will direct ``close attention'' to proposed agency disclosures that benefit competitors at the expense
of submitters, and have disfavored disclosure that affords a potential windfall to competitors by providing them
data at bargain rates rather than the considerable funds that otherwise would be expended in private research and
development.

No competitor of Fannie Mae is subject to data disclosure requirements of the breadth and detail included in the data
elements we have submitted to HUD. The information contained in our 1993 annual report on housing goals, the accompanying
tables and the proprietary information in the database, as to which we have not requested confidential treatment,
provide an unprecedented view of our business. We have limited our request for confidential treatment to only those
parts of the database having the likelihood, if released, to cause us substantial competitive harm. As a result, our
request is limited to only approximately 21 percent of the elements in the database. Because release of the information,
for which we have asked for confidentiality, would have clearly adverse commercial consequences for us, we request
that HUD designate the referenced items as ``proprietary pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4546 and invoke Exemption 4 to withhold
release of such information.

Dear Mr. Markison: The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie Mac'') has submitted to the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (``HUD'') computer tapes that contain single-family and multifamily loan registries
for the mortgages that Freddie Mac acquired during 1993. Freddie Mac requests that HUD accord proprietary treatment
to certain data elements of those loan registries because they contain confidential, proprietary Freddie Mac information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation's Request for Proprietary Treatment of Certain Loan-Registry Data Elements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (``HUD'') has required the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(``Freddie Mac'') to provide HUD with extensive information on the mortgages that Freddie Mac acquired in 1993. HUD
identified the general types of data required, in its Notice of Interim Housing Goals, 58 FR 53,047&hyph;53,096 (Oct.
13, 1993), and specified the form in which Freddie Mac was to submit the data, in a letter dated January 14, 1994. As so
directed, Freddie Mac submitted the required information to HUD in the form of two sets of computer tapes and 19 tables.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The computer tapes contain loan-level information for every mortgage that Freddie Mac acquired during 1993. One
set of tapes includes information on Freddie Mac's 1993 single-family mortgages, and it includes from 51 to 66 required
data elements for each loan, depending on the number of units in the property. The other set of tapes contains comparable
information for Freddie Mac's 1993 multifamily mortgages, and it includes a minimum of 42 elements for each loan,
with additional sets of elements for each additional ``unit type'' in the property. These two sets of tapes are referred
to as the ``loan registries.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freddie Mac requests that HUD accord proprietary treatment to certain of the data elements contained in the loan registries
because they contain confidential, proprietary Freddie Mac information. Freddie Mac does not, however, object
to the public release of the 19 tables submitted on March 31, 1994, which contain much of the categories of information
that Freddie Mac seeks to protect from public disclosure_but which disclose the information in an aggregated form
that is both useful and less likely to reveal confidential, proprietary Freddie Mac information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We discuss below the reasons that certain loan-registry data elements must be treated as proprietary information,
and we designate the specific data elements affected in an attachment to this request. Freddie Mac also requests that
any confidential treatment accorded to Fannie Mae data apply equally to data submitted by Freddie Mac, and vice-versa,
so that the same data elements will be treated equally for both enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Proprietary Information Generally
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Proprietary-Information Balance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD requested the loan registries under section 307(e) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C.
1456(e)). While HUD is generally authorized to make such section 307(e) loan-registry data available to the public
(section 1323 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``FHEFSSA''), 12 U.S.C. 4543),
HUD is expressly not permitted to make proprietary loan-registry data available to the public (FHEFSSA 1326, 12 U.S.C.
4546). In fact, FHEFSSA provides that no such information is to be made available to the public unless and until a final
decision has been made that the data are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 proprietary (FHEFSSA 1326(c), 12 U.S.C. 4546(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In effect, FHEFSSA recognizes the inherent tension between (1) the provision that directs HUD to make available data
that might be useful for housing-related research and (2) the provision that directs HUD to prevent the financial
or competitive harm to the enterprises that could flow from providing public access to proprietary information.
FHEFSSA, however, also provides guidance on how the balance between these conflicting directives is to be struck.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That is, FHEFSSA suggests that where reasonable people might disagree as to whether information is proprietary or
not, the issue should be resolved in favor of according the data proprietary treatment. Under FHEFSSA, information
is not to be made public until HUD makes a final determination as to whether the information is proprietary. It follows,
therefore, that where HUD is unable to make that determination to a reasonable degree of certainty, the information
should not be made public. This treatment of data where its proprietary character is uncertain would seem to be especially
appropriate during the 1993&hyph;1994 interim time period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach that the balance is to be struck against public disclosure presumably reflects a recognition on Congress'
part that, in the long run, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will be able to contribute most effectively to the nation's housing
needs if they retain one of the key attributes of every viable business_the ability to protect the confidentiality
of business strategies and plans. That is, in close cases, the need to protect the fundamentals of the enterprises'
ability to perform is presumed to outweigh the short-term benefits of placing more information on the public record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. What is ``Proprietary'' Information? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``proprietary'' is not defined in FHEFSSA and, on the face of the term, it could apply to virtually every data
element of the loan registries: All were developed by Freddie Mac and are Freddie Mac's property, and nearly all are
the types of information that Freddie Mac does not customarily provide to the public. However, reading the term in
the context of the two competing directives described above, the legislative history of the Act and analogous case
law, it may be more appropriate to interpret proprietary information to mean information that Freddie Mac does not
customarily release to the public_where the release of that information could tend to cause financial or competitive
injury to Freddie Mac, or could tend to impair competition between Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That more-limited interpretation is consistent with the legislative history of FHEFSSA. For example, the issue
of the scope of the term ``proprietary'' information was discussed directly in a floor debate of section 515 of the
Senate bill (the precursor to the proprietary provision of FHEFSSA) involving Senators Seymore and Garn: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. SEYMORE. It is my understanding that section 515 of the bill prohibits the Director [the Director was to administer
the housing goals under the Senate bill] from disclosing to the public information provided by the enterprises that
the Director determines to be proprietary. What types of information does this legislation contemplate would be
treated as proprietary? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. GARN. As a general matter, courts have construed various types of business information to be proprietary if it
might cause competitive or financial harm to the company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the legislation contemplates that the Director will determine what information is proprietary consistent
with current legal precedents applicable to other companies, section 515 is intended to protect especially information
relating to pricing and fees. If one of the enterprises learned of the other's pricing and fee strategy, it would create
an extraordinary competitive disadvantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintining competition between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is essential because there are only two GSE's involved
in mortgage finance. Congress created the two GSE's expressly for the purpose of ensuring competition. This competition
has resulted in lowering prices and enhancing efficiency to the housing finance market, which ultimately benefits
homeowners and renters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. SEYMORE. So, if I understand the Senator correctly, section 515 should ensure that information on pricing, fees
and other key aspects of business strategy will be considered proprietary and therefore protected from disclosure
to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. GARN. That is correct. By including this provision in the legislation, it was intended that the Director protect
from public disclosure a broad range of information that might impair competition between these two GSE's.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
That interpretation also is consistent with case law interpreting Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'')
(5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)), which is probably the case law to which the two senators had referred. The term ``proprietary
information'' does not appear in FOIA, but the principles underlying that exemption are similar_but not identical_to
those underlying section 1326 of FHEFSSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOIA Exemption 4 applies to ``trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged
and confidential,'' and courts have applied that exemption to protect information that a person is required to submit
to a federal agency where

II. Reasons for Designating Certain Data Elements as Proprietary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While Congress wished to shed increased light on the affordable-housing activities of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae,
it is virtually impossible to be certain that the release of any particular data from the loan registries would be harmless
to Freddie Mac, particularly during this interim period. Freddie Mac operates in an environment in which its operations
are constantly scrutinized by analysts at Fannie Mae, on Wall Street, and in other sophisticated financial institutions.
Those analysts have access to information from a variety of sources, and have increasing abilities to analyze that
information in ways that one may not immediately imagine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The data elements Freddie Mac has designated contain the type of information that Freddie Mac does not customarily
release to the public, and if all those data elements were to be publicly disclosed, we believe a variety of competitive
and financial harms could be suffered by Freddie Mac. In some cases, this harm could occur as a result of the disclosure
of a data element standing on its own; in other cases, the harm would occur because of a correlation of one data element
with another. The following are examples of problems that disclosure of all the elements would pose:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Both competitors and customers would be able to learn a great deal about the types of loans we are targeting for purchase
in particular areas of the country, thereby enabling them to counter our marketing strategy more effectively. Moreover,
the data would be available in one place, permitting competitors to obtain information relatively cheaply;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Competitors and customers would be able to learn far more than they can learn now as to our philosophy and strategy
concerning the purchase of newly originated versus seasoned loans;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Both customers and competitors would be able to learn more about the cycles of Freddie Mac's business during the
year, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
times at which we tend to be more busy than others, and the likely implications of seasonality to our pricing strategy;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) By analyzing the types of products we are purchasing, and where the purchases are occurring, customers and competitors
would be able to divine a great deal of nonpublic information about our likely strategy for meeting the affordable
housing goals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Customers and competitors would learn far more than they currently know about how the mix of mortgage types that
we purchase varies by region, thereby affecting the course of business negotiations in particular transactions
in particular regions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Customers and competitors would be able to change the dynamics of business negotiations regarding the disposition
of real estate owned (``REO''), since they would have access to far greater information concerning our REO disposition
strategies and practices. In addition, by analyzing REO statistics, a competitor could learn much about our default
patterns;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Customers and competitors would could use seemingly non-proprietary data as a ``proxy'' for information that
clearly is proprietary, or could use seemingly non-proprietary data as a link to other available information, so
as to reveal other, previously inaccessible proprietary information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In each case, the disclosure of information would work to the disadvantage of Freddie Mac, and to the advantage of other
parties. Also, in many cases_particuarly, but not exclusively, in the multifamily field_the public release of all
the data elements listed in a fully correlated manner probably would permit reviewers of the data to identify specific
properties. This raises important issues of personal privacy for homeowners, tenants, and lenders, who could soon
expect to become the targets of marketing efforts not only by our competitors, but by other businesses seeking to market
their products in demographic niches. In comparable circumstances, HUD has previously taken the position that it
would not release individual mortgage records in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.
552, because it would be an unwarranted invasion of the borrowers' privacy interests. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above concerns, Freddie Mac has evaluated each data element to determine whether or not its release
would be reasonably likely to cause Freddie Mac competitive or financial harm, either standing alone or linked to
other available information. In the interest of making as much data as possible available to the public, Freddie Mac
also considered whether certain data elements might be made available as separate files or packages of data elements,
so that they could be released without identifying the location of the underlying property. Without a link to the geographic
data, there may be no reason for HUD to withhold certain data elements as proprietary information. Similarly, we considered
whether certain data elements might be recoded so that HUD would not need to withhold them as proprietary information.
Such alternative treatments would substantially reduce Freddie Mac's proprietary concerns with respect to those
data elements, while making more information available to the public, consistent with the intent of Congress.

S. Rep. No. 464, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 44 (1992) (``The Director is encouraged whenever possible to develop disclosure
methods that take into account any proprietary concerns, while continuing public access to the information.'').
The results of Freddie Mac's evaluations, including proposed alternative treatments of certain data elements,
are summarized in the attachment to this request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We trust that this request and attachment will be sufficient for HUD to make its determination that the information
contained in the data elements designated in the attachment to this request contain ``proprietary'' information_that
is, that the designated data elements contain information that Freddie Mac does not customarily release to the public
and that the release of that information could tend to cause financial or competitive injury to Freddie Mac, or could
tend to impair competition between Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Alternatively, it should be sufficient for HUD to find
that it

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
cannot 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
