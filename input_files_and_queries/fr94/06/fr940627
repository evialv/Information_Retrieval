SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management is issuing revised interim regulations that implement the new Interagency Placement
Program. This new program supersedes the Displaced Employee Program and Interagency Placement Assistance Program
through which OPM provided job placement assistance to employees displaced by reduction in force. In response to
requests for a more effective and simplified program, OPM merged these existing programs into one single automated
comprehensive program, the Interagency Placement Program which became activated on December 1, 1993. Through this
program, OPM can provide quicker and better placement service to employees and agencies. In addition, 5 CFR part 351,
Reduction in Force, is being amended to add &sect;351.807, Certification of Expected Separation, which was erroneously
removed at 58 FR 32046 dated June 8, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM operated two placement programs, the Displaced Employee Program and the Interagency Placement Assistance Program.
Upon requests from agencies, OPM developed the new Interagency Placement Program. Agencies stated the Displaced
Employee Program and the Interagency Placement Assistance Program did not meet their needs. Among their reasons
were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Displaced Employee Program registrants were not required to update their registrations. When employees
were referred to agencies through the Displaced Employee Program, many were no longer available or could not be reached.
This resulted in a high declination rate and a slow, ineffective and cumbersome referral process, and was very costly
and time-consuming to the agencies. It also affected the credibility of the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each OPM Service Center maintained its own Displaced Employee Program inventory. When an agency recruited
for a position that was located in a geographic area not within the jurisdiction of its local OPM Service Center, it
had to contact another OPM Service Center to clear the Displaced Employee Program. It was confusing to agencies as
to which Service Center to contact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Interagency Placement Assistance Program was not successful in placing employees who were identified
as surplus.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Interagency Placement Assistance Program was not successful in placing excepted service employees who
did not have personal competitive status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to the Displaced Employee Program, agencies must consider Interagency Placement Program registrants before
making competitive appointments to positions that are expected to last more than 1 year. This means that agencies
must consult the Interagency Placement Program inventory when filling positions through a competitive register
held by OPM or an agency with delegated examining authority; direct-hire authority; or the Outstanding Scholar provision.
Agencies do not need to consult the Interagency Placement Program inventory when making noncompetitive appointments
or conversions to the competitive service. No individual may be selected for such a vacancy as long as a qualified IPP
registrant is available. Appointing officers may not pass over an IPP eligible to select a non-IPP eligible unless
an objection to the IPP eligible is sustained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet the needs of its customers and resolve the problems identified, OPM is proposing only a few changes to existing
regulations. The existing regulations remain the same with the following changes to 5 CFR part 330, subparts C, D,
and H; 5 CFR part 323, subpart C and 5 CFR part 351, subpart H:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;these proposed regulations reflect the new Interagency Placement Program name;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the Interagency Placement Program automates and centralizes OPM's placement program, expedite the referral
process, reduces costs to the agencies, increases the period of placement assistance for career-conditional employees
from 1 year to 2 years, and requires registrants to update their registration every 6 months to maintain a current placement
program inventory;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;excepted service employees must have personal competitive status obtained from a previous appointment and
be in Tenure 1 or 2 to be eligible for registration in the Interagency Placement Program; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;employees must have received a specific reduction in force notice or a Certification of Expected Separation
to register in the new Interagency Placement Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency personnel offices have been provided an Interagency Placement Program Operating Plan and an Automated Applicant
Referral System Users Handbook which describe the operation of the Interagency Placement Program.

Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking
because it would be contrary to the public interest to delay access to benefits. Also, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3),
I find that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The delay in the effective date is
being waived to give effect to the benefits extended by the amended provisions at the earliest practicable date.

This subpart covers the Interagency Placement Program for employees who will be displaced or have been separated
from their Federal jobs as a result of agency work force reductions, compensable on-the-job injury, discontinued
service retirement or disability retirement. Agencies have the primary responsibility for providing placement
assistance to their surplus or displaced employees, and for operating positive placement programs as set forth in
&sect;330.307 of this subpart. OPM supplements these agency efforts by administering an Interagency Placement
Program which gives surplus or displaced employees priority referral to positions in other agencies.

Eligibility for assistance under the IPP will be terminated if one of the following occurs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A registrant's 2 year period of eligibility expires (except for preference eligibles who are eligible for up to
1 year of additional assistance as specified in &sect;330.407);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The registrant requests, in writing, that placement assistance be terminated;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The registrant is placed in a nontemporary position in either the competitive or excepted service;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The registrant declines an offer of continuing employment in the competitive or excepted service under conditions
(i.e., grade, salary, geographic location, or work schedule) the registrant previously indicated were acceptable,
unless OPM determines that an exception is warranted; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The agency notifies OPM that the registrant no longer meets the eligibility criteria for program registration
and placement assistance.

. (1) Each agency has primary obligation to assist, to the maximum extent practical and in keeping with the requirements
set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in the placement of surplus and displaced employees. OPM's placement
program only supplements these efforts and is not intended to relieve an agency of its responsibility to provide the
maximum placement assistance possible.

In accordance with subpart H of part 351 of this chapter, agencies must inform affected employees about the Interagency
Placement Program at the same time that Certifications of Excepted Separation or specific reduction in force notices
are distributed. Employees who receive a Certification of Expected Separation may register up to 6 months prior to
separation. Agencies are responsible for assisting employees with their registration forms, for completing the
information requested on the forms, for ensuring employees meet the minimum qualification requirements for the
position(s) registered, and for sending them to the appropriate office as instructed by OPM.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Agencies will give full consideration to individuals referred through OPM's Interagency Placement Program. Full
consideration is a careful and open review of the qualifications of the registrant as described in the individual's
application forms, contact to determine interest and availability, and an interview; if possible, to further assess
the registrant's ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period of time. An appointing officer
may not pass over an IPP eligible to select a non-IPP eligible unless an objection to the IPP eligible is sustained by
OPM or an agency with delegated authority.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, which currently requires inspecting
(one-time) the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings for looseness on certain Piper Aircraft Corporation
(Piper) PA24, PA30, and PA39 series airplanes, and, if looseness is found, incorporating Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear
Rivet Replacement Kit). This action retains the initial inspection of the stabilator torque tube bearing support
fittings, and makes these inspections repetitive unless the above referenced service kit is incorporated. Incidents
of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings on several of the affected airplanes in compliance
with the current AD prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of pitch control
because of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, which could result in loss of control
of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain
PA24, PA30, and PA39 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on Februrary 1, 1994 (59 FR 4605). The action proposed to supsersede AD 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1870,
with a new AD that would retain the initial inspection of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, and
make these inspections repetitive unless Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) is incorporated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these
minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already
proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 4,409 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $242,495. This figure
does not account for any repetitive inspections that would be required by this AD. However, incorporating Piper Part
No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings eliminates
the need for the repetitive inspection requirement of this AD. In addition, this kit may have been incorporated through
compliance with AD 75&hyph;27&hyph;08, Amendment 39&hyph;2624. This AD requires inspecting the rivets of the stabilator
torque tube bearing support fittings, and incorporating the referenced kit if any rivets are found misaligned. The
cost figure presented above is based on the assumption that none of the owners/operators affected by this AD have incorporated
Piper Part No. 760 835. The FAA anticipates that numerous owners/operators have incorporated this kit, thereby reducing
the cost impact of the required action.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Dassault Aviation Model Mystere
Falcon 900 series airplanes. This action requires either pressure checks and charging, if necessary, of the low pressure
chamber of the nose gear shock absorber, or torque checks of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation
is within specified limits; recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary; and installation of a relay in the electrical
rack. This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of the nose landing gear (NLG) to extend fully. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent malfunction of the NLG during extension due to recompression of the nose gear shock
absorber.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Dassault Aviation Model Mystere Falcon 900 series
airplanes. The DGAC advises that it has received reports of recompression of the nose landing gear (NLG) shock absorber
due to the relative wind upon retraction. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the NLG to extend
fully using the normal hydraulic mode, the emergency hydraulic mode, or the emergency mechanical mode. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dassault Aviation issued Service Bulletin F900&hyph;A149 (F900&hyph;A32&hyph;11), dated April 13, 1994, which
describes procedures for pressure checks of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber or a torque check
of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; and recharging of the
shock absorber, if necessary. Dassault Aviation also issued Service Bulletin F900&hyph;150 (F900&hyph;32-12),
dated May 9, 1994, which describes procedures to install a relay in the right side of the electrical rack. The purpose
of this relay is to interrupt the NLG retraction cycle if the NLG shock absorber is not fully expanded. This will prevent
a lock-up of the NLG and a subsequent inability to deploy the NLG when necessary. The DGAC classified these service
bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;098&hyph;014(B)R1, dated May 11, 1994,
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the NLG to extend (deploy) using
the normal hydraulic mode, the emergency hydraulic mode, or the emergency mechanical mode. This AD requires either
repetitive pressure checks and charging, if necessary, of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber,
or torque checks of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; and
recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary. This AD also requires installation of a relay in the right side of the
electrical rack. Installation of the relay terminates the repetitive pressure and torque checks. These actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;82&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive (AD) that applies to certain Piper Aircraft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation (Piper) Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T
airplanes. This action requires repetitively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspecting the main landing gear trunnions for cracks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing any trunnions found cracked, and eventually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing these trunnions with improved parts as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminating action for the repetitive inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. Several reports of the main landing gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trunnions cracking on the affected airplanes prompted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action. The actions specified by this AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent collapse of the main landing gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane damage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an AD that would apply to certain Piper Models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1676). The action proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require repetitively inspecting the MLG trunnions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eventually replacing these trunnions with improved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts as terminating action for the repetitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection requirement. The proposed inspections would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with Piper Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin (SB) No. 787B, dated August 25, 1993. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed replacement would be accomplished in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that, with the way the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance of paragraph (b) of the proposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently written, airplanes with trunnions that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 2,000 hours time-in-service (TIS) are grounded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter requests that the FAA give airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators in this scenario a grace period. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs and has changed the compliance portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of the AD to: ``Upon the accumulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2,000 hours TIS on a MLG trunnion or within the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 hours TIS, whichever occurs later, *&blank;*&blank;*''. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change would give 100 hours TIS for compliance to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators with 1,901 hours TIS or more accumulated on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trunnion as of the effective date of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter also states that, in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) of the proposal, an affected airplane could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounded if parts were not available after 2,500 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TIS (2,000 hours TIS replacement compliance and 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours TIS for parts unavailability grace period). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter recommends that, if parts are unavailable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA allow the owner/operator to inspect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane every 100 hours TIS until parts are available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and not just for the next 500 hours TIS. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs that airplanes would be grounded at 2,500 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TIS if parts were not available. However, the Piper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft Corporation has assured the FAA that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate surplus of parts currently exist for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators to comply with this action. The AD is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unchanged as a result of this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommends that, instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory replacement, the FAA mandate the 100-hour TIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive inspections with mandatory replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trunnions found cracked. The FAA does not concur. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA analyzed information related to MLG trunnion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures from service difficulty reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's warranty claims; and, from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, the FAA established the mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement in order to maintain these airplanes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their original type certification level of safety. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter feels that an eddy current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection of the MLG trunnions is more reliable than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dye penetrant inspections. This commenter states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, based upon similar MLG trunnion failures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United Kingdom, the dye penetrant inspection method may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not detect a critical crack. The FAA does not concur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past experience based on FAA reports indicates that dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetrant inspections are very successful in detecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracks in the MLG trunnions, and the equipment needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is more readily available and less costly than that for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eddy current inspections. The FAA will consider any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests to accomplish an eddy current inspections as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an alternative method of compliance to paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD under provisions specified in paragraph (d) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD. The AD is unchanged as a result of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter addresses lateral grinding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marks found on a significant number of MLG trunnions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area of the past crack initiation. This commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends blending these marks out to remove any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traces of scoring. The FAA concurs, and has added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions for this requirement to the AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommends that this AD action also cover inspections in two other locations in the MLG, the swivel pin
and trunnion attach fittings. The FAA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on February 11, 1994,
to seek comments regarding the best action (if any) to take in order to correct any possible problems with retractable
MLG swivel pins. The FAA is currently reviewing comments from this ANPRM and has not determined that there is an unsafe
condition that requires AD action under part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39). The MLG trunnion
attach fittings are the subject of Piper SB No. 956, dated March 3, 1992. The FAA has evaluated all information related
to this issue and has determined that AD action is not justified at this point. The FAA will continue to evaluate any
additional information, and, if necessary, will implement future rulemaking. The AD is unchanged as a result of this
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer has informed the FAA that certain Piper Model PA34&hyph;220T airplanes (serial numbers 34&hyph;8133001
through 34&hyph;8233088) may be equipped with trunnion housing assemblies, Piper part number 39486&hyph;802 (left)
and 39486&hyph;803 (right) with embossed forging number 67924&hyph;2. The FAA has determined that this AD should
not apply to airplanes with these trunnion housing assemblies installed. The FAA has revised the Applicability section
of the final rule to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received on the FAA's determination of the cost impact of this proposed action upon U.S. operators
of the affected airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the compliance time change in paragraph (b) of the proposal,
the Applicability section change, the addition of the provision to blend any lateral grinding marks, and minor editorial
corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes, the addition, and any editorial corrections will not change
the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 2,265 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
16 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $1,100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $4,484,700. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator
has accomplished the required action. The FAA believes that some airplane owners have already accomplished the required
actions. With this in mind, the FAA anticipates that the cost of this AD will be much lower than the figure referenced
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification
of any cracked tension ties. This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in tension ties. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension ties and the resultant rapid decompression
of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3527). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage
upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters support the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the proposed 1,000-flight cycle compliance time for low-time airplanes be revised
to require that the inspection be performed ``upon the accumulation of 20,000 total flight cycles or within 1,000
flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever comes later.'' The FAA does not concur. Since cracking
has been found on airplanes that had accumulated less than 20,000 flight cycles, the FAA reasoned that requiring inspection
of all airplanes within 1,000 flight cycles, regardless of the total number of flight cycles, would be prudent to preclude
the propagation of cracks in airplanes in the Model 747 fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision specifying that pressurization cycles
of 2.0 psi or less need not be counted as a flight cycle when determining the number of flight cycles relative to the proposed
compliance thresholds. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that operating at cabin pressure differentials of 2.0
psi or less is applicable to only one operator. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to include various provisions
in an AD applicable to a single operator's unique use of an affected airplane. Further, this commenter does not compile
data for each of its airplanes so that an individual airplane's pressurization cycles could be determined; instead,
it uses a fleet average to calculate the equivalent number of pressurization cycles. The FAA does not consider it appropriate
to use approximations for determining compliance with this AD. Furthermore, since there are numerous factors that
affect the calculation of flight cycles, such as total number of low pressure cycles, amount of thrust, number of gross
weight flight cycles, etc., the FAA has determined that these mitigating factors could be best evaluated through
requests for alternative methods of compliance, as provided for in paragraph (c) of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the FAA and Boeing review the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01,
amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), which requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection
program include inspections that will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural
Significant Item (SSI). This commenter states that the proposed inspection of the tension ties may be included in
the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01. The FAA concurs and has reviewed the requirement
for inspections contained in AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01. This AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks that were detected
while performing inspections specified by the Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) program, which
was required to be implemented by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01. The purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program
of a sample number of airplanes, which will detect the potential for cracking in specific areas of the airplane that
are critical for safety of flight. Whenever cracks are found in an SSI during an inspection in accordance with the SSID
program, the FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition within the applicable fleet.
This AD is issued in response to such a finding. Therefore, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD
93&hyph;06&hyph;01 to remove the requirement to inspect the tension ties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 203 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 5 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $31,075, or $275 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series
airplanes. This action requires modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. This amendment
is prompted by a report that, as a result of a previous modification, certain electrical wires with a positive voltage
were connected to an electrical connector that is also wired to the liftdumper system, which could negatively affect
the liftdumper system. The actions specified in this AD are intended to ensure protection against uncommanded deployment
of the liftdumper.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
certain Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes were modified to increase air conditioning airflow at higher altitudes
by augmenting the airflow through the turbine bypass valves. These airplanes were modified in accordance with Fokker
Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;026. On some airplanes, this modification resulted in the installation
of electrical wires with a positive voltage into an electrical connector that is also wired for the liftdumper system.
Incorporation of this modification on these airplanes could negatively affect the liftdumper system, since only
electrical wires that are directly connected to a ground should be installed in this connector. This condition, if
not corrected, could result in reduced protection against uncommanded deployment of the liftdumper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045, Revision 1, dated November 17, 1993, that describes
procedures for modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. This modification entails disconnecting
certain electrical wires from the connector in the number 2 relay panel and connecting these wires to a different connector.
Accomplishment of this modification must be performed after or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in conjunction with Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;026, in order to ensure that only electrical wires
that are directly connected to ground are installed to the electrical connector that is also wired for the liftdumper
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RLD classified Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045, as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness
Directive BLA 92&hyph;079/2 (A), dated December 24, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has also issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;056, Revision 1, dated November 24, 1993, which supersedes
Fokker Service Bulletins SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;026 and SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045. Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;056
describes procedures for augmentation of the flow through the turbine bypass valves of the air conditioning system
to increase the air conditioning airflow at higher altitudes. The RLD classified this service bulletin as optional;
however, the service bulletin incorporates the provisions of Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045,
including the instructions necessary to correct the wiring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent reduced protection against uncommanded
deployment of the liftdumper. This AD requires modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with either of the service bulletins described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There currently are no Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes affected by this AD on the U.S. Register. All airplanes
included in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry;
therefore, they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary
to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed
on the U.S. Register in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
7 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Required parts would
cost approximately $80 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $465 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule and was not preceded by notice and opportunity for public comment,
comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written
data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted
in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;47&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58T
series helicopters, that currently requires a one-time inspection of the engine drive shaft assembly (drive shaft
assembly) for cracks and loose balance weights. This amendment requires initial and repetitive visual and florescent
penetrant inspections of the drive shaft assembly for cracks and improperly installed rivets. This amendment is
prompted by three reported incidents of loose or missing drive shaft assembly balance weights and two reported incidents
of fatigue cracks on the drive shaft assembly near the balance weight rivet hole. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent failure of the drive shaft assembly, loss of power to the rotor system, and a subsequent forced
landing of the helicopter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 90&hyph;10&hyph;02,
Amendment 39&hyph;6590 (55 FR 18305, May 2, 1990), which is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58T series
helicopters, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 31, 1993 (58 FR 45859). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive visual and florescent penetrant
inspections of the engine drive shaft assembly for cracks and loose balance weights, and replacement as necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed, except for editorial changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 58 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
18 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $57,420. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

In a companion order in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission)
is issuing a final rule revising its standards of conduct and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate
transactions. The final rule continues some of the existing reporting requirements under Order No. 497.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 To prevent a regulatory gap between the termination of the existing reporting requirements and the effective date
of new reporting requirements, the Commission is extending the sunset date for the existing reporting requirements
from June 30, 1994 until July 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This order does not change the reporting burden under the current Order No. 497 regulations. The order merely extends
these requirements until the effective date of the Commission's new regulations to prevent a regulatory gap.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 497&hyph;E, the Commission extended the sunset date for the reporting requirements under &sect;250.16
of the Commission regulations until June 30, 1994. On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 which proposed to revise these reporting requirements significantly.

Contemporaneously with this order, the Commission is issuing a final rule in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 which
significantly revises the marketing affiliate reporting requirements. The final rule continues some of the reporting
requirements from the previous regulations, in particular the requirement that pipelines maintain transportation
discount information for both affiliates and non-affiliates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unless good cause is shown to shorten the time period. Because the final rule continues some of the reporting requirements
from the existing rule, a gap between the termination of the old requirements and the implementation of the new could
result in a loss of information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rather than preventing this regulatory gap by requiring pipelines to undertake expedited implementation of the
final rule in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000, the Commission finds it preferable to extend the current reporting
requirements for only one month, until July 31, 1994, which will correlate with the August 1, 1994 effective date of
the new regulations.

IV. Environmental Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The regulations extend the reporting requirements on interstate natural gas pipelines.
Since these pipelines are not small entities, the regulations will not have significant economic impact on small
entities. Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed
herein will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 unless good cause is found to shorten the time period. The sunset date for the current reporting requirements will
expire on June 30, 1994 before the APA's 30 day publication requirement is fulfilled, which would result in a gap in
the reporting requirements. To prevent such a gap, &sect;&sect;250.16 (a)(3), (c)(1), and (d)(1) will be revised,
effective June 30, 1994, to continue the current reporting requirements until July 31, 1994.

II. Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the final rule to average
60 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. In lieu of being physically
filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be posted on pipeline Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBs), established and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636, and collected
under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines to be provided to the Commission upon request.
The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents under the rule is estimated to total approximately 3,500 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule provides for fewer information items, eliminates regular, periodic filings, and requires certain
information to be posted or made available upon request in text format, the burden estimate for FERC&hyph;592 in the
Final Rule represents a burden reduction of about 70 hours per respondent_or a total reduction of about 4,300 hours.
The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC&hyph;592 information collection is 7,881.2 hours.
A copy of this final rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North
Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202)
208&hyph;1415, FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]. Comments on the requirements of this rule may also be sent to the Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (202) 395&hyph;6880].

III. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in Order No. 497,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering
affiliates. The rule adopted Standards of Conduct (codified at Part 161 of the Commission's regulations)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in &sect;250.16)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standards of Conduct establish the principles applicable to relationships between pipelines and their affiliates.
In general, they provide that the pipeline cannot favor affiliates with information or transportation discounts
not available to non-affiliates. The tariff provisions require pipelines to include in their tariffs a list of operating
personnel shared with affiliates, the information and format for transportation service requests, the procedures
used to resolve complaints, the procedures used to inform shippers about the availability and pricing of transportation
services.

The reporting requirements require pipelines to provide information relating to transportation transactions
with affiliates. The pipelines must file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating to requests for
transportation service by affiliated marketers and to discounts provided to affiliates. The regulations also require
the pipelines to maintain the same information for non-affiliated shippers and to provide that information to the
Commission upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year
to determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse.
The Commission has extended the sunset provision on several occasions, most recently extending it until June 30,
1994.

In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring
pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and by implementing changes in the terms
and conditions for providing transportation service. One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was
the initiation of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation
capacity, including storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission also required that
pipelines establish EBBs to provide information about available firm and interruptible capacity on the pipeline,
including the firm capacity available through capacity release.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule revises both the Standards of Conduct and the reporting requirements in a number of respects. The Commission
is reducing the pipelines' reporting burden by eliminating maintenance and posting requirements relating to requests
for transportation service and implementing in their stead limited requirements that better comport with pipeline
operations under Order No. 636.

In particular, the regulations are being revised to reflect the data used by pipelines to allocate capacity among
shippers when available capacity is not sufficient for the pipelines to honor all requests for service. For those
pipelines whose tariffs rely upon contract information to allocate capacity, the pipelines will be required to maintain
a log (for both affiliates and non-affiliates) of contract dates or other relevant information that they use to allocate
capacity. Pipelines that allocate capacity on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis (or use a method that does not rely on contract data) will not have to maintain the log. The affiliate log must be
posted on the pipelines' EBBs, while the full log (for both affiliates and non-affiliates) must be provided to the
Commission, within a reasonable time, upon request according to the specifications and format contained in Form
No. 592.

The Commission also is coordinating its posting requirements for affiliate discounts to eliminate duplicative
EBB postings. Current &sect;250.16 requires the pipelines to post information about affiliate discounts on their
EBBs. Current Standard of Conduct I requires pipelines to make any discount offered to an affiliate contemporaneously
available to non-affiliates. In order for the pipelines to fulfill this obligation, the Commission has required
that they make a contemporaneous posting on their EBBs of information about affiliate discounts, so that non-affiliates
will be aware of the discount and can request a comparable discount if they believe they are similarly situated.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 To eliminate the posting of duplicative information, the Commission is incorporating a contemporaneous posting
requirement for affiliate offers into former Standard I (new Standard H)
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 and is deleting the similar requirement for posting affiliate discounts under &sect;250.16. In effect, the Commission
is not adding a new reporting requirement here. It is merely moving a current EBB posting requirement from &sect;250.16
to new Standard H in order to eliminate duplicative postings.

Section 250.16 also required pipelines to maintain discount information for both affiliate and non-affiliate transactions
and provide this information to the Commission upon request. The Commission is retaining this maintenance requirement,
because information on affiliate and non-affiliate transactions is needed for the Commission to monitor affiliate
transactions and compare these transactions with non-affiliate transactions.

 unless good cause is shown to shorten the time period. Because the final rule continues some of the reporting requirements
from the existing rule, a gap between the termination of the old requirements and the implementation of the new could
result in a loss of information. Rather than requiring the pipelines to expedite implementation of the new regulations
to prevent a regulatory gap, the Commission in a contemporaneous order, in Docket No. RM87&hyph;5&hyph;016, is extending
the current reporting requirements for only one month, until July 31, 1994. The regulations adopted by this order
will then go into effect on August 1, 1994.

V. Overview of the Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission stated that, as part of its continuing assessment of the Order No. 497 regulations, it would
consider comments on the need to retain these requirements as a whole. Many pipeline commenters submit that all the
Order No. 497 requirements should be removed as unnecessary and duplicative of existing prohibitions on undue discrimination.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 They maintain that six years after promulgation of the regulations, no pattern of abuse has been demonstrated.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
They further contend that the potential for pipelines to provide preferential treatment to their affiliates has
been virtually eliminated by the restructuring of pipeline operations pursuant to Order No. 636. They maintain that
the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service has resulted in a truly competitive market in which
all gas sellers will be able to compete on an even basis. They argue that the Commission's establishment of a mechanism
permitting firm shippers to release capacity has eliminated the pipelines' monopoly over transportation service,
so that the pipelines' ability to grant significant preferences to affiliates is reduced or eliminated. The capacity
release mechanism, they maintain, creates an open auction for firm capacity in which the pipeline must award capacity
to the highest bidder and so cannot favor its affiliate.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 They also assert that the ability of pipelines to favor affiliates with important transportation information has
been undercut by the Commission's requirement that the most critical transportation information be disclosed publicly
on pipeline EBBs. Moreover, if some potential for abuse remains, they contend the Commission's complaint process
and enforcement staff provides adequate means to detect and prevent such abuse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
They similarly contend that, under Order No. 636 provisions, pipelines cannot discriminate in awarding interruptible
service because it must be awarded to the highest bidder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These commenters also contend that the limited need, if any, for the regulations, must be juxtaposed with the anticompetitive
effects of the regulations. They assert the regulations run counter to the Commission's goal of fostering competition
because they have the effect of inhibiting beneficial communication between pipelines and affiliates, thereby
limiting the ability of affiliates to compete in the marketplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission decides to retain some or all of these requirements, these commenters recommend that the Commission
provide a sunset date (generally one year) on which the regulations will expire. They assert that a sunset provision
will ensure a comprehensive reevaluation of the requirements after further experience with capacity release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other side, Hadson and Indicated Parties support the continuation of the requirements, with some additions.
Hadson asserts that the new deregulated gas environment will increase competitive pressures on all players, thereby
increasing the incentive and likelihood that pipelines will try to enhance the competitive position of their affiliates
and sales marketing divisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indicated Parties argue that the Commission should add a new provision prohibiting pipelines from providing a discount
to an affiliate which is a supply area interruptible shipper.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 They assert that affiliates can use a pipeline's standing offer of a transportation discount to undercut a transaction
negotiated by a non-affiliated competitor and that even contemporaneous disclosure of the discount does not provide
the non-affiliate with sufficient time to save its transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Indicated Parties would not prohibit supply area discounts if the discount offer is posted on an EBB significantly
prior to gas flow so all shippers can avail themselves of the discount. They also would not prohibit individual discounts
to market area shippers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At this time, the Commission is not convinced that pipelines' incentives or ability to favor affiliates has been so
significantly reduced by Order No. 636 that these provisions can be removed entirely.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 While the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service does create a more competitive gas market,
pipelines may still have an incentive to skew transportation transactions and information in such a way as to benefit
affiliates. The requirement to post information on EBBs has not eliminated the pipelines' ability to favor their
affiliates with information. By virtue of their position, pipelines may still be privy to important information
regarding transportation capacity that they are not required to post on their EBBs.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 More important, at this stage, the Commission does not have sufficient experience with the new capacity release mechanism
established by Order No. 636 to evaluate whether this mechanism will create such a competitive market for transportation
capacity that pipeline preferences for affiliates will no longer be of significance.

The absence of any significant complaints is not necessarily due to the pipelines' lack of incentive or inability
to favor affiliates. It may, instead, be due to the pipelines' adherence to the Order No. 497 requirements and the public
scrutiny of affiliate transactions provided by the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, pipelines will be aware of their own future plans, such as anticipated expansions, which might be valuable
planning information for marketers. Without the Standards of Conduct, the pipelines could favor their affiliates
by providing advance notice of their plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonetheless, the purposes of Order No. 497 can be achieved in a manner that is substantially less burdensome to pipelines.
The Standards of Conduct and reporting requirements that remain establish a reasonable balance between preservation
of the affiliates' ability to compete and the prevention of undue favoritism to the affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed later, the Commission is retaining all the Standards of Conduct (with the exception of Standard H). These
Standards generally require pipelines to: refrain from disclosing non-affiliate information to affiliates; contemporaneously
disclose to the market any general transportation information provided to affiliates; make any discount offered
to an affiliate contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliates by posting the information on
the pipelines' EBB; and maintain separation of pipeline and affiliate operating personnel to the maximum extent
practicable. These Standards of Conduct do not prevent pipelines from transacting business with their affiliates
or communicating with or providing discounts to affiliates; they require only that the pipelines initiate common
sense procedures to ensure that affiliates are not provided with information or discounts not available to others.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only two reporting requirements remain: the current requirement to maintain discount information for affiliates
and non-affiliates and a revised requirement that some pipelines maintain and disclose the data used to allocate
service on their systems. These requirements are much reduced from those under the current regulations and are the
minimum needed to provide sufficient information about affiliate transactions for the Commission and shippers
to monitor and police these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will not prohibit supply area discounts to affiliates, as Indicated Parties suggest. Preventing
all supply area discounts would seriously impede the ability of affiliates to compete by denying them justifiable
discounts available to non-affiliates. New Standard H requires pipelines to make any such discounts contemporaneously
available to other similarly situated shippers and this provision strikes the appropriate balance between protection
of non-affiliates and maintenance of competition between affiliates and non-affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is not proposing a sunset provision for these regulations, because a firm date, such as one year, may
not provide a sufficient period for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of Order No. 636 on the affiliate regulations.
The Commission, however, is committed to reviewing these requirements as the industry obtains more experience operating
in the restructured environment, and, in particular, is interested in the effect of capacity release on pipeline
interruptible service.

VI. Standards of Conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to delete only one provision from the Standards of Conduct (&sect;161.3 dealing with take-or-pay
issues). Tenneco and KGPC contend that all Standards of Conduct provisions should be removed because the conduct
they seek to prevent is already precluded by the requirements, in &sect;&sect;284.8 and 284.9, that pipelines must
not unduly discriminate in the provision of transportation service. Tenneco asserts the standards actually may
send the wrong signal by suggesting that unduly discriminatory conduct not mentioned in the standards is somehow
considered less egregious than conduct specifically mentioned. Many other commenters request that the Commission
delete or modify specific provisions.

Indicated Parties suggest that the Commission include a new definition of marketing affiliate that makes clear it
applies to pipelines' new merchant service established under Order No. 636 and a revision in the definition of transportation
to make clear that transportation includes storage. Section 284.286 provides that pipelines' new merchant divisions
are subject to the marketing affiliate regulations,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 and, therefore no new definition is needed. The Commission, however, will revise both Part 161 and &sect;250.16 to
cross-reference &sect;284.286.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also is revising &sect;284.286 to conform to the changes being made in &sect;161.3.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Section 284.1 of the Commission's regulations defines transportation as including storage,

 and the Commission will revise the definition of transportation in &sect;161.2 to parallel the Part 284 definition.

to pipelines transporting gas pursuant to Subparts B and G. Continued reference to Subparts H and K is redundant since
both Subparts apply to pipelines transporting gas under Subparts B and G.

F to eliminate the requirement for contemporaneous disclosure of sales and marketing information the pipelines
provide to marketing affiliates.

1. Standard E_Disclosure of Information Received From Non-affiliates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tenneco contends Standard E should be removed entirely. It argues no basis exists for prohibiting disclosure to marketing
affiliates of information received from other shippers, while permitting that information to be disclosed to non-affiliates.
It maintains that if a shipper would be harmed by pipeline disclosure of information the shipper provides, the same
harm would result from disclosure of that information to another non-affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concludes that the Standard needs to be retained to prevent potential affiliate abuse. The Standard
recognizes that the pipelines have access to non-affiliate information due to the pipelines' control over transportation
service and that the pipelines have an economic incentive to favor affiliates with such information when disclosure
will benefit the affiliate. The same incentive does not apply to sharing of non-affiliate information with other
non-affiliates.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Tenneco's argument that harm may result from disclosure of non-affiliate information to other non-affiliates would
not necessarily dictate the deletion of Standard E, as Tenneco argues. It could justify expanding the Standard to
prohibit disclosure to non-affiliates as well. But the Order No. 497 regulations are limited to affiliates because
the pipelines have an economic incentive to favor affiliates, which is lacking in their dealings with non-affiliates.
Undue discrimination with respect to non-affiliates would be covered by the general Part 284 regulations.

CNG contends Standard E should be modified to permit disclosure of sales and marketing information: only the sharing
of transportation related information would be prohibited. CNG recognizes the Commission took a contrary position
in Order No. 497&hyph;E, but urges the Commission to reexamine that conclusion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CNG argues that the transmission of sales and marketing information is unrelated to the pipeline's exercise of market
power over transportation, which is the only legitimate basis for restricting disclosure. CNG also claims Standard
E may work to the disadvantage of non-affiliated shippers. For example, it states that, during the recent cold weather,
it received requests for help in locating gas supplies that, due to Standard E, it was unable to pass along to its marketing
affiliates, which may have been able to assist those customers.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission reaffirms its decision in Order No. 497&hyph;E to retain the Standard E restrictions on disclosure
of all information (including sales and marketing information) received from non-affiliated shippers. Unlike
sales and marketing information that the pipelines obtain from the public domain (and can provide to affiliates under
Standard F), sales and marketing information obtained from non-affiliated shippers (Standard E information) is
directly related to the pipelines' control over transportation service. While public domain information is available
to all, the information pipelines obtain from their customers is not, and Standard E prevents the pipelines from favoring
their affiliates by providing them with non-public information that the pipelines have obtained as result of providing
transportation service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG contends the Standard prohibits disclosure of information to affiliates when such disclosure may benefit the
non-affiliated shipper providing the information to the pipeline. The Standard is intended to protect a non-affiliated
shipper against the disclosure of confidential or commercially sensitive information to marketing affiliates.
If the non-affiliated shipper finds such disclosure to be in its interest, it can waive its Standard E protection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Panhandle Eastern Pipelines and Tenneco contend Standard F should be deleted. They contend even the remaining requirement
to disclose transportation-related information needlessly inhibits competition, because the pipelines are uncertain
what information they need to publicly disclose and, therefore, may act cautiously by withholding beneficial, legitimate
information from affiliates. They assert that with the advent of capacity release, the pipelines' monopoly over
transportation has been lessened, so that the rationale for the regulation no longer exists. Further, they contend
that all important information related to transportation is now required to be made publicly available on the pipelines'
EBBs. Tenneco observes that a less intrusive means of preventing abuse would be for the Commission to specify the transportation
information that could provide competitive advantages and require that this information be posted on the EBBS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will retain Standard F. By requiring contemporaneous disclosure of transportation information
provided to affiliates, Standard F ensures equal treatment of non-affiliates and affiliates, without undue burden
on the pipelines. Not all transportation related information may be disclosed on pipeline EBBs, yet advance knowledge
of such transportation information could be of value to an affiliate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission fails to see how capacity release justifies deletion of the Standard. The potential to acquire released
capacity does not mitigate the harm to non-affiliates that could result from selective disclosure of important non-public
transportation information to affiliates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, a pipeline's future plans to add facilities, such as new receipt or delivery points or additional capacity
is not currently disclosed on EBBs, but advance knowledge of such transportation information could be of value to
an affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the Commission is not in the best position to determine all the types of transportation information that
may be of competitive significance. The more general requirement of Standard F to post any information pipelines
provide to affiliates permits the market itself to determine whether the information is of value. The Standard, therefore,
strikes a reasonable balance between the need to protect against undue favoritism to affiliates and the need to permit
pipelines to transact business with their affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KGPC also requests clarification of what transportation information must be contemporaneously disclosed. It asserts
that in Order Nos. 497 and 497&hyph;A, the Commission stated that specific transportation, sales, and marketing
information related to the affiliate's request need not be disclosed. It claims that although the Standard was difficult
to interpret even before Order No. 497&hyph;E established different requirements for disclosure of sales and marketing
information and transportation information, the distinction between these categories of information has made
the determination of what information must be disclosed even more complex.

KGPC further requests clarification of the Commission's statement in Order No. 497&hyph;E that, even though sales
and marketing information no longer must be disclosed under Standard F, the Commission is not barred from examining
such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases. KGPC requests that the Commission specify the circumstances
in which it will consider such issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Order No. 497&hyph;E, the Commission removed the general requirement for pipelines to disclose sales and marketing
information. However, the Commission still retains the right to determine in individual proceedings that certain
pipelines must disclose sales and marketing information when the circumstances show such disclosure is needed to
prevent undue discrimination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to eliminate &sect;161.3(h) of the regulations which prohibits pipelines from
conditioning or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from
a marketing affiliate. The Commission stated that this provision should no longer be needed since Order No. 636 established
procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment (GSR) costs resulting from the reformation or termination of
take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service.

Hadson and Indicated Parties argue for retention of this provision. Hadson states that, while the size of the take-or-pay
problem has been reduced, the Commission has approved pricing differential mechanisms for reducing GSR costs under
which gas subject to take-or-pay contracts is auctioned by the pipeline or marketing affiliate on a monthly basis.
It also states the Commission has approved reverse auctions. These mechanisms, it asserts, still create the potential
for anticompetitive tieing. Indicated Parties suggest that the phrase gas supply realignment costs be substituted
for take-or-pay costs to ensure that pipelines do not attempt to tie the availability of unbundled transportation
and storage services to the purchase of specific gas supplies.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 But they do not explain why retention of this requirement is necessary in light of the procedures established in Order
No. 636 and the restructuring cases for dealing with GSR costs.

They both also contend the Commission should retain current &sect;250.16(b)(2)(xiii), which requires disclosure
of whether any gas being transported is subject to take-or-pay relief. Indicated Parties again suggests the substitution
of gas supply realignment costs for take-or-pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will delete this requirement. Hadson has not demonstrated how the pipeline would rig an auction or
a reverse auction
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 that would result in tieing of an agreement to release gas to the purchase of services from an affiliate. The auction
or reverse auction involves bidding on gas contracts which is independent of any services provided by a marketing
affiliate. Moreover, the Commission can better monitor potential affiliate abuse in auctions by considering the
circumstances of the auction mechanism proposed in individual cases rather than by promulgating a generic standard,
which may not apply to certain cases.

1. Retention of Standard H 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is retaining the current standard, which is being renumbered Standard H. Current Standard I requires
pipelines making a transportation discount to an affiliate to make a comparable discount contemporaneously available
to all similarly situated non-affiliates. A number of commenters contend this provision should be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso asserts the regulation is not needed, contending pipelines will not make an unjustified discount to an affiliate,
because the pipelines will lose money. It further argues that pipelines may actually forgo making beneficial and
competitive case specific discounts to affiliates because of the vagueness of the term ``similarly situated.''
It asserts pipelines may not offer their affiliates a discount to avoid the risk of having to unjustifiably reduce
rates to other shippers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
K N Energy similarly contends that pipelines may not provide a market-justified discount to affiliates given the
extra obligations and heightened scrutiny created by the provision. KGPC maintains the requirement seriously restricts
negotiations between pipelines and affiliates because the parties must be continuously concerned about whether
a conversation could be construed as an offer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
K N Energy and Tenneco contend the requirement is not needed because the Commission has sufficient mechanisms to monitor
and prevent undue discrimination. They point out the pipelines are required to file discount reports under Part 284,
which enable non-affiliates to monitor discounts and file complaints of undue discrimination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will not delete Standard H, because requiring pipelines to make discounts contemporaneously available
to similarly situated non-affiliates is needed to ensure equal treatment. Standard H does not substantially inhibit
the provision of justified discounts to affiliates. When pipelines offer discounts to affiliates, they must only
be able to provide a valid explanation for why another shipper requesting a comparable discount is not similarly situated
to the affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discount information required to be filed under Part 284 is not a substitute for Standard H. Standard H requires
pipelines to make offers contemporaneously available to similarly situated shippers. In contrast, the Part 284
discount information is not filed until 15 days after the close of the billing period, which is not equivalent to the
contemporaneous notice required under Standard H.

2. Revision of the Standard to Eliminate Duplicative Posting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is revising the standard to eliminate duplicative postings of information about affiliate discounts.
Section 250.16 currently requires the pipelines to post information about affiliate discounts on their EBBs. This
information includes the duration of a discount, the discounted rate, the maximum rate, and the quantity of gas scheduled
at the discounted rate during the billing period for each delivery point. A number of commenters requested that the
Commission reduce or eliminate the &sect;250.16 reporting requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Former Standard I required pipelines to make discounts available to similarly situated non-affiliates.

 (CIG),
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission sought to eliminate any potential ambiguity about the way in which pipelines are to determine similarly
situated shippers under the standard. The Commission found that pipelines could make a determination of similarly
situated only if the pipelines first informed non-affiliates of the terms of the affiliate offer so the non-affiliates
would have the opportunity to request a comparable discount if they thought they were similarly situated.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 Since all pipelines are now required by Order No. 636 to maintain EBBs, the Commission provided that the pipelines
needed, at a minimum, to provide notice of affiliate discounts by posting them on the pipelines' EBBs. The information
to be posted is virtually identical to that required under &sect;250.16, including the date of the offer, the discount
rate, the quantity of gas scheduled to be moved at the discounted rate, and the delivery points in the offer. Most pipelines
now comply with the standard by using EBB posting.

For example, a pipeline cannot determine on its own whether the non-affiliate was willing to abide by the terms and
conditions contained in the affiliate offer. It needs to provide the non-affiliate with notice of the terms and the
opportunity to comply with them.

The Commission has determined that the duplicative posting requirements for affiliate discounts are not necessary.
The Commission, therefore, will modify Standard H to clarify that pipelines are to comply with the Standard by contemporaneously
posting information about affiliate discounts on their EBBs and permitting non-affiliates to request such discounts
if they conclude they are similarly situated. The Commission will then eliminate the requirement to make similar
EBB postings under &sect;250.16. These revisions do not add a new reporting requirement. They essentially eliminate
duplicative postings by moving the affiliate discount posting requirement from &sect;250.16 to Standard H.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elimination of the &sect;250.16 reports will not adversely affect the ability of non-affiliates to monitor affiliate
transactions. The only significant difference between the Standard H and &sect;250.16 EBB posting requirements
is that the &sect;250.16 reports are posted at the close of the billing period so they include the quantity of gas actually
scheduled by the affiliate whereas scheduled quantity information could not be included in a contemporaneous posting
under Standard H. But after-the-fact information on actual quantities scheduled is not needed for shippers adequately
to monitor affiliate transactions. Non-affiliates only need to be able to determine whether they were denied a discount
offered to an affiliate, and the information in the contemporaneous postings will allow them to make this determination.
The actual quantities scheduled under a discount casts no light on whether the pipeline engaged in undue discrimination
when the discount was offered.

Accordingly, the Commission will incorporate into Standard H the requirement that a pipeline offering a discount
to an affiliate (or a discount for a transportation transaction in which an affiliate is involved) must contemporaneously
post the offer on its EBB and maintain the posting for 90 days. The posting must include the date of the offer, the discount
rate, the quantity of gas scheduled to be moved at the discounted rate, the delivery points in the offer, any conditions
underlying the offer (for example, if the discount is dependent on an agreement to move a certain quantity of gas or
on the use of a specific transportation path), and the procedures by which shippers can request a comparable discount.
The posting of the information must conform with the requirements applicable to pipelines' EBBs as required in &sect;284.8(b)(4).

3. Specific Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Affiliate's Role in a Transportation Transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require the pipelines to disclose an affiliate's role in a transportation
transaction when they are not the shipper in the transaction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several pipelines object to this proposal, contending it creates an impossible burden since pipelines will not know
the affiliate's role if it is not a shipper.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 KGPC contends that disclosure of an affiliate's role, when it is not a shipper, runs counter to the Commission's determination
in Order No. 497&hyph;E to eliminate Standard F's contemporaneous posting requirements for non-transportation
related information. Texas Gas states that since the pipeline generally will not know whether an affiliate is involved,
the Commission should permit pipelines to obtain this information from shippers.

It states that most pipelines already require shippers to complete a request form for internal purposes and that information
on the affiliate's role could be included on that form, even if no other Order No. 497 information needs to be included.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's requirement to disclose discounts when an affiliate is involved in the transaction is merely a continuation
of the requirement in &sect;250.16(b)(2) of the existing regulations to report such transactions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In many instances, pipelines are aware of the role played by its affiliate or sales operating unit. For instance, when
the affiliate acts as an agent in a transaction (by arranging for gas supplies and transportation), the pipeline may
know of the affiliate's role even when it is not the official shipper because the affiliate will be making the transportation
arrangements on behalf of its client. In response to Texas Gas's comment, the Commission will not require the pipelines
to obtain the information from shippers about affiliate involvement. The pipelines need disclose that information
only when they have knowledge of the affiliate's involvement in the transaction.

In fact, pipelines have reported transactions in which an affiliate is not the shipper under the existing regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds no inconsistency between the requirement to disclose transactions in which an affiliate is
involved and its decision in Order No. 497&hyph;E to eliminate the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for sales
and marketing information provided to an affiliate. When a pipeline is aware that its affiliate is involved in a transportation
transaction, it may offer a selective transportation discount to the actual shipper in order to ensure that the shipper
does business with the affiliate. Thus, a pipeline's provision of a transportation discount in a transaction in which
an affiliate is involved can raise the same question of potential undue discrimination as a discount provided directly
to the affiliate. Conversely, when the pipeline does not know of its marketing affiliate's involvement in a transaction,
the possibility of unduly preferential behavior seems unlikely.

b. Inclusion of Receipt Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Registry contends that receipt point information should be included because discounts may sometimes
depend on the point at which gas enters the system. The Commission, however, will not include receipt points because
receipt point information is often voluminous. If in a particular case, a discount is based on the receipt point used,
that condition would be disclosed as a condition for granting the discount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Disclosure of Non-Affiliate Discounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indicated Parties suggest that the Commission require posting of non-affiliate discount information on the EBB
within 15 days of the commencement of service. KGPC also suggests that the Commission should replace the affiliate
reporting requirements with a general requirement for EBB posting of all interruptible transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will not require posting of non-affiliate information, because information on discounts to non-affiliates
is unrelated to the goal of the reporting requirements_to permit non-affiliates to monitor affiliate discounts
for possible discrimination. A non-affiliate need not have access to other non-affiliate information to monitor
affiliate transactions; the non-affiliate can compare any affiliate discounts with the rate the non-affiliate
pays. The non-affiliate information will be available to the Commission upon request, under &sect;250.16, should
the Commission need to compare the discounts offered to affiliates and non-affiliates in investigating a complaint
of discrimination.

E. Standard G &amp; Standard K (New Standard J)_Separation of Operating Employees and Books of Account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Standards G and K require that the operating employees of pipelines and affiliates function independently
to the maximum extent practicable and that the books of account for the pipelines and affiliates be maintained separately.
Tenneco contends these provisions are unnecessary after Order No. 636, because pipelines are required by Order No.
636 to unbundle sales from transportation service and, therefore, must establish separate operations and staffs.
Moreover, as a practical matter, it contends employees making day-to-day decisions regarding gas transportation
will not be making decisions for the affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By requiring separation of operating personnel to the maximum extent practicable, Standard G complements the other
Standards of Conduct by reducing the possibility that information will improperly be shared with an affiliate. Tenneco
is correct that in Order No. 636, the Commission did adopt new regulations under Part 284 that, like Standard G, require
pipelines to ensure that their unbundled sales operating personnel operate independently from its transportation
operating personnel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 But these regulations do not apply to marketing affiliates, and, therefore, Standard G still is needed to ensure adequate
separation of pipeline and marketing affiliate personnel.

VII. Tariff Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Shared Operating Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.16(b)(1)(i) requires pipelines to maintain in their tariffs a list of operating personnel shared by
the pipelines and their affiliates, which, under &sect;250.16(d)(2), they must update quarterly, if any changes
occur. The NOPR proposed to continue this requirement. CNG and Panhandle Eastern Pipelines request clarification
that the pipelines will not be required to make quarterly filings if no changes in shared personnel or facilities have
occurred. The Commission agrees that a filing need only be made if changes have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Request For Service Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to eliminate the requirement, in current &sect;250.16(b)(1)(ii), that pipelines include
in their tariffs the information required for a valid request for service, including the information required for
the Form No. 592 affiliate transportation log. Indicated Parties suggest this provision be retained, so parties
will know what must be included in a valid request for service. They assert that, as far they can determine, this requirement
is not duplicated in other regulations and that such information is important, because a valid request for service
is often a prerequisite for participation in the capacity release program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the requirement for pipelines to include information needed for a valid service request
is no longer related to affiliate abuse. Under the previous regulations, pipelines were required to report certain
information about shippers that the pipelines could obtain only through the transportation request form.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under this rule, the Commission is no longer requiring pipelines to report these categories of information, and,
therefore, a tariff provision requiring shippers to disclose such information is no longer needed. The Commission
notes, however, that, under Part 284, pipelines must have tariff provisions that provide for equality of transportation
service, with reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for acquiring such service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To comply with these requirements, the pipelines still must have tariff provisions describing the procedures necessary
to request service and participate in the capacity release program.

For example, for each transportation transaction reported on Form No. 592, pipelines were required to report the
supplier of gas, the end-user, and whether or not the gas was subject to take-or-pay relief. This information would
be known by the shippers, not the pipeline. The requirement for shippers to complete the transportation request form
to obtain service ensured that the pipelines would obtain the necessary information from the shipper.

C. Availability And Pricing Of Transportation Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to eliminate current &sect;250.16(b)(1)(iv) that requires pipeline tariffs to include
the procedures used to inform affiliated and non-affiliated shippers of the availability and pricing of transportation
service and of the capacity available for transportation. The Commission concluded this requirement was superfluous
in light of the Order No. 636 requirement for pipelines to provide equal and timely access on their EBBs to information
relevant to the availability of service on their systems.

Indicated Parties contend that the current Order No. 636 requirements do not require pipelines to post the procedures
used to determine the availability of transportation services, the amount of capacity the pipelines have available,
or the pricing of services. They submit that the Commission should ensure that pipeline tariffs require pipelines
to post information on ``operationally available'' capacity on their EBBs and to describe the procedures used in
posting the information, such as the timing of postings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concludes that the requirements of Part 284 provide sufficient disclosure of the necessary information
about capacity on pipelines. Towards that end, the Commission recently issued Order No. 563 detailing the information
about capacity that the pipelines must disclose on their EBBs (as well as through downloadable files), including
operationally available capacity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

VIII. Transportation Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;250.16 requires pipelines to post a variety of information about affiliate transportation service
requests and affiliate discounts on the pipelines' EBBs. The regulations also require the pipelines to maintain
the same information for non-affiliate transactions, so that it can be provided to the Commission upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to reduce significantly the information concerning shippers' requests for
transportation service, retaining only a few elements, principally relating to the position of requests in the pipelines'
transportation queues.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 But the Commission was unsure about the value of these requirements and requested comments on whether they should
be retained. In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to retain the maintenance and posting requirements related to affiliate
and non-affiliate discounts, but proposed to limit these requirements to interruptible transportation.

The request for service items proposed to be retained were: the identity of the shipper requesting service, the date
the request was received, the affiliation of the requester with the pipeline, the maximum daily volume of gas requested,
the position of the request in the transportation queue, the disposition of the request, complaints concerning requested
or provided service, and any tariff waivers granted in providing the requested service.

Many commenters contend all service request information should be deleted. WGM and WNG/Northwest contend the original
basis for these requirements was to monitor the process of awarding contracts so that affiliates would not receive
preferential queue positions. They maintain this rationale is no longer valid since queues are no longer used in the
restructured environment. Numerous other commenters similarly contend that queues no longer have any effect on
curtailment or bumping rights.

Panhandle Eastern Pipelines, Natural, and TGPL contend the requirement to post complaints parallels the Commission's
requirement to disclose complaint procedures in the tariff and only one should be retained. TGPL and Natural contend
that complaints are solely between the pipeline and the complaining party, so electronic posting serves no purpose.
TGPL further argues that posting of complaints is too complex for electronic format. AER/MRT request that complaints
by end-users should not be included since the Commission has proposed deleting the requirement to post the state of
the ultimate end-user (former &sect;250.16(b)(2)(xi)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AER/MRT and TGPL contend the requirement to post tariff waivers duplicates Standard L, which requires pipelines
to maintain a log of tariff waivers that must be available for copying on a daily basis. Indicated Parties, however,
requests the waiver provision be amended to require separate reporting of waivers granted to affiliates and sales
marketing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission agrees that the data now required to be posted concerning service requests do not reflect the methods
used by the pipelines to allocate capacity. As the commenters point out, Commission policy and pipeline tariffs require
that interruptible transportation be allocated first on the basis of price paid when the pipeline is unable to provide
the amount of requested service. If the rate bid still is not sufficient to allocate interruptible capacity, some
pipelines rely on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 allocation or some other means to allocate capacity that does not depend on contract dates or other similar information.
For these pipelines, the Commission agrees that posting contract information is not necessary because that information
bears no relation to the capacity allocation decision.

However, some pipelines continue to rely on contract or other information to break ties and determine to whom interruptible
capacity is allocated. But even for these pipelines, the current regulations may not capture the appropriate information
used to allocate interruptible capacity. The current regulations only require the pipelines to maintain information
about the service request date, while some pipelines use other dates or other information for allocation of interruptible
capacity, such as the contract execution date, the date gas is first shipped under a contract, rate schedule, transportation
type, or other rankings.

Accordingly, the Commission will revise the regulations to better fit the current need for contract information
and to reduce the reporting burden on the pipelines. Those pipelines that continue to rely upon contract execution
dates, service request dates, or other data to allocate firm or interruptible capacity must maintain (for both affiliate
and non-affiliate shippers) a log of those contract dates or other information used to allocate capacity.

The Commission is deleting the requirements to post complaints and tariff waivers. If a complaint is not handled by
the pipeline to the satisfaction of the complaining party, the complainant can bring the matter to the Commission
either through the Commission's Enforcement Task Force hotline or the Commission's formal complaint procedures.
In addition, if shippers have questions about tariff waivers, the ability to obtain such information under former
Standard L (new Standard K) is sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indicated Parties support continuation of the current requirement to disclose the maximum daily quantity of gas
to be transported under a contract and contend the requirement should be expanded to include the receipt and delivery
points under the contract. The Commission, however, does not find that continued disclosure of this information
is necessary. Information on maximum daily quantities under each contract is already available for all shippers
in the initial reports that pipelines must file under Part 284.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current &sect;250.16 regulations require pipelines to disclose affiliate discounts on their EBB and to maintain
non-affiliate information, which will be provided to the Commission, upon request. As discussed earlier, the Commission
is deleting the requirement for pipelines to post affiliate information on their EBBs, because the pipelines contemporaneously
post affiliate discount information under Standard H. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters contend the Commission should eliminate the reporting requirements entirely. Tenneco maintains
that the reporting requirements are not needed to monitor or prevent abuse, because sufficient information about
the processing of transportation requests and rates is maintained by the pipelines and would be available if allegations
of undue discrimination are made. It states permanent data collection and posting requirements should not be imposed
based on unsubstantiated suspicions that abuses will occur in the post Order No. 636 environment. Several commenters
argue the Order No. 497 requirements are duplicative of the requirement in &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv) that pipelines
file discount information with the Commission.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
61
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Natural argues that since the Commission found the Part 284 reporting requirements to be sufficient for firm service,
these requirements similarly should be sufficient for interruptible service. Columbia argues that, like the allocation
of firm capacity, the allocation of interruptible capacity on its system takes place during the nominating/bidding
process conducted through and disclosed on its EBB, and therefore no separate Order No. 497 posting requirement is
needed.

information to adequately monitor and compare affiliate and non-affiliate transactions.

The Commission had proposed to eliminate the requirement for the pipelines to provide the discount information for
firm capacity, stating that, under Order No. 636, much of the posting and awarding of firm service by the pipelines
will take place on the pipelines' EBBs. The Commission, however, has reconsidered and will continue the current requirement
that pipelines include firm discount information in the data to be made available to the Commission. First, after
review of pipeline tariffs, the Commission is not sure that all pipelines will be posting the details of their sales
of firm capacity on their EBBs. Second, including firm discounts in this data will enable Commission staff to process
the information more easily, because all relevant discount information will be provided in one format.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Standard H, pipelines will be posting information related to affiliate discount offers on their EBBs and, under
&sect;250.16(c), they also will be posting the affiliate contract allocation data on their EBBs. In the NOPR, the
Commission proposed to conform the Order No. 497 EBB posting requirements with the EBB requirements under Part 284,
and the Commission is adopting this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipelines, therefore, must ensure that the affiliate information is displayed in a user-friendly format and
that their EBB incorporates the same features as apply to the other aspects of the pipelines' EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
65
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The protocols and procedures for accessing the affiliate information also must be the same as those used to access
each pipeline's EBB. Thus, the pipelines must permit users to obtain the affiliate information by using the same phone
number and log-on procedures used to access the information about available capacity on the pipelines' EBBs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Columbia and Texas Gas contend that pipelines should be permitted to post the affiliate information in a manner consistent
with their EBB formats and not be required to adhere to the Form No. 592 formats. Hadson contends the Commission should
continue to require a hard copy filing of the Form No. 592 information with the Commission, because many pipelines'
Order No. 497 boards are so poorly designed that shippers experience difficulty in accessing and abstracting useful
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form No. 592 is not intended to dictate the mode of displaying information on EBBs, but to provide the requirements
for providing information to the Commission electronically. The EBB regulations require the pipelines to display
information in a user-friendly format and pipelines, therefore, are responsible for developing a user-friendly
display for the affiliate information posted on their EBBs. Since the Commission has established EBBs as the mode
of communication between pipelines and their customers and the EBBs are required to be user-friendly, the Commission
will not require hard copy filings. Moreover, any possible benefits from hard copy filing are outweighed by the filing
burden on the pipelines and the administrative burden on the Commission of collecting and maintaining the hard copy
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle Eastern Pipelines contend that integrating the Order No. 497 information into their EBB would be costly
and if the Commission insists on merger of the boards, it suggests the Commission should provide 9 months within which
to do so. The Commission concludes that integrating the marketing affiliate information required here into the pipelines'
current EBB structure is necessary to ensure shippers can access the information easily without having to use an entirely
different set of procedures and protocols to view the affiliate information. In fact, many pipelines already have
integrated their affiliate information with their Order No. 636 EBBs. Pipelines that cannot accommodate such integration,
may file a request for an extension of time, providing good cause for extending the compliance deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PG&amp;E requests clarification about the pipelines' obligation to archive the information required to be posted
and maintained under the rule. It contends the pipelines should be required to maintain the information for a reasonable
period of time, suggesting they archive the data at least until their next rate case. The EBB posting of affiliate information
must conform with the Commission's requirements for EBBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulations provide that data be maintained consistent with the &sect;284.8(b)(4) requirements relating
to EBBs, which includes a three year archiving requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
67
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, all information posted on EBBs must be archived for three years. Similarly, the three year maintenance requirement
will apply to the information in the log of contract allocation data, &sect;250.16(c),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

Pipelines must maintain the log data for each contract as long as the data is used to allocate capacity and for three
years after the data is no longer used for capacity allocation. For example, if a contract is terminated or revised,
the historical data about that contract must be maintained for three years.

X. Miscellaneous Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Reporting of Affiliate Discounts Under Part 284 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;250.16(d)(4)(ii) permitted pipelines filing affiliate discount reports to exclude those transactions
from the discount reports required to be filed under &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv). The Commission proposed to remove this
provision, because, under its proposed regulations, pipelines would no longer file affiliate reports with the Commission,
but would post them on their EBBs. AER/MRT contend that if affiliate discounts are posted on the EBB within 15 days of
the transaction, the Part 284 discount reports still should not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will require pipelines to file affiliate discounts under &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv), because the Commission
is deleting the requirement to post affiliate discounts under &sect;250.16. Under Standard H, pipelines must only
post offers of affiliate discounts. Thus, pipelines must file the affiliate discount information for the completed
transaction under the Part 284 regulations.

B. Relation of the Marketing Affiliate Regulations of This Rule to Tariff Requirements Addressing Similar Problems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
El Paso requests clarification that the Commission's Order No. 497 regulations, as codified in Part 161 and &sect;250.16
of the regulations, constitute the exclusive requirements relating to marketing affiliates superseding any specific
tariff provisions related to affiliate transactions. It asserts that the Commission has in the past imposed tariff
requirements for certain transactions (such as gas inventory charges or interruptible sales) that were meant to
address problems similar to those addressed in the affiliate provisions. It maintains that these tariff provisions
should be considered inoperative so all pipelines will be treated equally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission cannot make a universal determination of the applicability of all outstanding tariff provisions.
The Commission, however, will carefully review pipeline filings to eliminate any such provisions the pipelines
believe are superfluous in light of the marketing affiliate requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Applicability of the Marketing Affiliate Regulations of This Rule to Permanent Releases of Capacity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AER/MRT request clarification of whether a permanent release of capacity will trigger the reporting and maintenance
requirements of the rule. They point to the Commission's finding that the Order No. 497 reporting requirements do
not apply to temporary capacity releases,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
69
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and contend the same treatment should apply to permanent releases, since permanent releases, like temporary releases,
are controlled not by the pipeline, but by the firm shipper holding capacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission does not agree that permanent releases are identical to temporary releases. In a temporary capacity
release, the releasing shipper is still obligated to the pipeline under its initial contract. Thus, even if the releasing
shipper agrees to accept a discounted rate, the pipeline has not agreed to the discount because the releasing shipper
will owe the maximum rate under its contract.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
70
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a permanent capacity release, however, the releasing shipper's contractual obligations end, and the replacement
shipper enters into a new contract with the pipeline. Thus, if the pipeline offers a discount to its affiliate it must
post that discount on its EBB under Standard H and it must maintain the required discount information under &sect;250.16.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The releasing shipper is entitled to a credit to reflect the amount bid by the replacement shipper. Of course, if the
releasing shipper's contract with the pipeline involved a discount, that fact would be disclosed when the contract
was consummated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hadson requests clarification that, as stated in Order No. 497&hyph;E, the posting of Order No. 497 information on
a pipeline's EBB constitutes a filing with the Commission for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001, which provides
criminal penalties for a knowing and willful misrepresentation to the government.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission reaffirms its position in Order No. 497&hyph;E that posting of the affiliate information is deemed
to be a filing for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.

E. Posting of Pipeline Tariffs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indicated Parties contend that the pipelines should be required to post their tariffs. They assert such posting would
save shippers as well as the pipelines considerable time and money as compared with the current requirement that pipelines
make their tariffs available for public inspection and send copies to shippers. The issue of posting pipeline tariffs
is unrelated to the affiliate regulations and is not appropriately considered in this proceeding. The issue has been
discussed at some of the conferences in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000 relating to standards for EBBs, and that
would be a more appropriate forum to consider this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Relationship to the Commission's EBB Standards Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Registry contends that the issues of affiliate disclosure are related to issues involved in the Commission's
ongoing proceeding, in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, to develop standards for electronic dissemination of
information about firm and interruptible capacity. In particular, the National Registry is concerned about the
disclosure of information relating to the firm and interruptible capacity rights of shippers, and suggests that
the Commission hold a technical conference to determine how best to provide disclosure of capacity rights information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the issue of disclosure of capacity rights is properly considered only in the Docket No.
RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000 proceeding. As stated earlier, in Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission found merit in the
development of an index of capacity rights and directed the industry to develop a final proposal by September 30, 1994.

XI. Environmental Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
72
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
73
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
74
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The regulations impose reporting requirements on interstate natural gas pipelines. Since
these pipelines are not small entities, the regulations will not have significant economic impact on small entities.
Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed herein
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

General Instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The notation f(m,n) will be used to denote a numeric string of length ``m'' including a decimal (``.'') with ``n''
digits following the decimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In preparing the required flat file, the following conventions must be followed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) All volumetric data should be stated in MMbtu's (rounded to the nearest MMbtu), except where noted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) All rates should be stated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
cents
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 per MMbtu fixed decimal numbers, format f(10,2). For example, $1.5264/MMbtu should be stated as 152.64. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Negative values should be reported with a ``^'' sign preceding the first nonzero digit reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Commas must not be included in any numeric field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) All dates should be reported as six digit numerics (month, day, year), unless otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The sequence number is the sequential number assigned to a record as it is recorded on a schedule/record. The sequence
number is incremented as additional records are added to a schedule/record and will be between 1 and 999,999, inclusive.
(Note: the sequence number should be right justified, zero filled.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The reference number is the alphanumeric string formed by concatenation of the Schedule ID, sequence number, and
beginning character position of the item footnoted. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a respondent's Company ID reported in the Discounted Transportation (Storage) Transaction Record would have reference
number ``D000001008'' formed by joining (concatenating) the schedule ID ``D'', the sequence number ``000001'',
and the beginning character position of the item ``008''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Record any footnote relative to any recorded item in the ``Footnotes Record'', schedule ID `F'. Each footnote should
be cross referenced to the schedule and record (line) it pertains to by the appropriate reference number (see above).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions_Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Today I concur that the time has come to cut the regulatory burden associated with the marketing affiliate rules, particularly
the filing and record maintenance requirements tentatively adopted six years ago to ensure an equitable transition
to competition among independent and pipeline-affiliated marketers. My colleagues and I disagree only in part and
that disagreement is surely a matter of degree, not principle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I support the retention of the modestly revised Standards of Conduct applicable to pipeline relationships with marketing
affiliates because, under these circumstances, they impose a useful and relatively light-handed transactional
discipline on these relationships and help guarantee fair play and equal information in the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I nevertheless think the retention of the reporting and records maintenance requirements in revised FERC Form No.
592 is excessive and unnecessary.

 I am inclined to think it demonstrates an unhappy tendency to which we all occasionally fall prey in a bureaucratic
culture: assumptions and requirements, once adopted, tend to perpetuate themselves beyond their useful lives.

FERC Form No. 592 is codified in section 250.16 of the Commission's regulations. If this form were eliminated, I believe
certain of the other requirements contained in section 250.16 (such as the requirement to include specified information
in the tariff) could be transferred to the Standards of Conduct to allow for complete recision of section 250.16.

The federal government does at least one thing well: It generates red tape. But not one inch of that red tape appears
by accident. In fact, the government creates it all with the best of intentions. It is time now to put aside our reverence
for those good intentions and examine what they have created_a system that makes it hard for our civil servants to do
what we pay them for, and frustrates taxpayers who rightfully expect their money's worth.

This might strike my readers as rhetorical overkill as applied to this case, given the best of intentions that underlies
today's decision to retain the reporting requirements and FERC Form No. 592. After all, the rule claims (somewhat
inexplicably) that on average they will require only 60 workhours from each company per year. Yet, the continuation
of these recordkeeping requirements is not, in my estimation, supported by any strong evidence of need. I find no significant
numbers or patterns of complaints alleging that pipelines have favored affiliates. There is virtually no evidence
of industry interest in these data. In fact, in one of the few pleadings in this case that offers more than opinion, a
major pipeline system indicates that its Order No. 497 log was accessed only an average of 2&hyph;3 times monthly since
1990, with a significant portion of those calls (up to 50 percent at times) coming from Commission staff. The rule was
not designed to generate discounting data for rate cases. Nor was it formulated as a device to obviate discovery in
rare complaint cases. The need for these data is, therefore, highly conjectural. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final analysis, it is clear that the majority wants to retain this small part of the Code of Federal Regulations
``just in case.'' And, by eliminating the sunset date, it is likely that FERC Form No. 592 will linger in regulatory
perpetuity. In my opinion, the cost (however small) to the industry and ultimately to ratepayers of continuing any
part of this recordkeeping requirement is greater than any probable benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, I dissent from that aspect of the rule that continues FERC Form No. 592.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the extension of the import restrictions on culturally significant
archaeological artifacts from the Sipan Region of Peru which were imposed by T.D. 90&hyph;37. The Deputy Director
of the United States Information Agency (USIA) has determined that the emergency conditions which originally warranted
the imposition of import restrictions still exist. Accordingly, the restrictions will continue to be in effect for
an additional three years, and the Customs Regulations are being amended to indicate this extension.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, the Deputy Director of the
United States Information Agency (USIA), after consultation with the Secretaries of State and Treasury, determined
that certain archaeological materials from the Sipan Archaeological Region of Peru, which material was identified
as comprising part of Peru's cultural patrimony forming part of the remains of the Moche culture were being pillaged,
or in danger of being pillaged, in crisis proportions and that an emergency condition existed which warranted the
imposition of a prohibition on the importation of such articles into the United States. In T.D. 90&hyph;37, the Customs
Service announced the imposition of import restrictions and identified the types of articles covered by the restrictions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Director of the USIA has considered the recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee and
determined that the emergency conditions which warranted imposition of the initial restrictions still exist and
has decided to extend the import restrictions for another three years. (See 59 FR 30633, June 14, 1944.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Customs is amending &sect;12.104g (19 CFR 12.104g) to reflect the extension of the import restriction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of E.O. 12866. Because no notice of proposed
rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) do not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this amendment reflects the extension of emergency import restrictions on cultural property which is currently
subject to pillage and looting, pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, no notice of proposed
rulemaking or public procedure is necessary. For the same reason, a delayed effective date is both impracticable
and contrary to the public interest.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 19, 1991, final regulations under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(a)(17) (TD 8362) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 47603). On August 10, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register (57 FR 35536) regulations proposing to extend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the final regulations under section 401(a)(17) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(and related regulations), generally to plan years beginning on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or after January 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 30, 1993, proposed regulations under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(a)(17) amending the final regulations were published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 69302). Written comments were received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the public on the proposed regulations. Because the only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for a public hearing was withdrawn, no public hearing was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held. After considering all of the written comments received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations are adopted as modified by this Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains amendments to the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under section 401(a)(17) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code (Code). These regulations reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enactment of section 401(a)(17) by section 1106 of the Tax Reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1986 (TRA '86), and subsequent statutory changes made by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1011(d)(4) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1988 (TAMRA) and section 13212 of the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93). These regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code.

Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 401(a)(17) of the Code provides an annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit for each employee under a qualified plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This limit applies to a plan in two ways. First, a plan may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base contributions or benefits on compensation in excess of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual limit. Thus, a plan does not satisfy section 401(a)(17) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless it provides that an employee's compensation in excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the annual limit is not used in determining allocations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accruals for a plan year to which the annual limit applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the amount of an employee's annual compensation that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken into account in applying certain specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiscrimination rules under the Code is subject to the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit. Thus, for example, an employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation in excess of the annual limit is disregarded in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the accrual rates for defined benefit plans under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those nondiscrimination rules. The annual compensation limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies separately to each group of plans that is treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single plan for purposes of the applicable nondiscrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations with only minor modifications, as described
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Changes Made by OBRA '93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Lower Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to its amendment by OBRA '93, the annual compensation limit was $200,000 adjusted for cost of living increases
($235,840 for 1993). Section 401(a)(17) was amended by OBRA '93 to reduce the annual compensation limit to $150,000
and to modify the manner in which cost of living adjustments are made to the limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Annual Adjustment of Compensation Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the effective date of the OBRA '93 changes, the annual compensation limit was increased annually based on
the section 415 cost of living adjustment. After the effective date of OBRA '93, the annual compensation limit, as
adjusted for changes in the cost of living, is rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $10,000. Thus, the annual
compensation limit increases only when the cost of living adjustment would increase the limit by an increment of at
least $10,000. These final regulations retain the rules in the September 1991 regulations that any increase in the
limit is effective for the plan year, or other 12-month period used to determine compensation, commencing in the calendar
year for which the limit is adjusted and that the increase applies only to compensation for the year of the increase
and subsequent years that are used in determining an employee's benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Proration of the Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations retain the requirement in the September 1991 regulations that the annual compensation limit must
be prorated if compensation for a period of less than 12 months is used for a plan year. However, in response to comments
on the proposed regulations, the final regulations clarify that no proration is required merely because the amount
of elective contributions, matching contributions, or employee contributions that is contributed for each pay
period during a plan year is determined separately using compensation for that pay period. For example, a section
401(k) plan provides each employee with the right to elect to defer up to 6 percent of compensation for a plan year, and
then, in accordance with each employee's election for the plan year, contributions are made monthly using the employee's
compensation for that pay period. Although the compensation for the plan year that may be taken into account in determining
each employee's elective contributions is subject to the annual compensation limit, the compensation for each month
would not required to be limited to $12,500 (1/12 of $150,000) in this situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Effective Date and Transition Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 401(a)(17) is generally effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989. The changes made by
OBRA '93 are generally effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Special statutory effective
dates are provided for collectively bargained plans. In addition, OBRA '93 provides a special grandfather rule for
certain eligible participants in governmental plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations under section 401(a)(17) are generally effective at the same time that the reduced limit under
OBRA '93 applies to the plan. However, in the case of plans maintained by tax-exempt organizations, the regulations
are effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor modifications have been made to the examples in these regulations to reflect the OBRA '93 statutory change,
the change in the effective date of the regulations from the date in the 1991 regulations, and an employer's choice
of complying with the provisions of these regulations prior to the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Fresh-Start Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations retain the rule from the September 1991 regulations that benefits accrued or allocations made under
a plan for plan years prior to the effective date of section 401(a)(17) are not subject to the annual compensation limit.
The regulations also retain the rule in the proposed regulations that the benefits accrued or allocations made under
a plan for plan years prior to the effective date of the OBRA '93 changes are not subject to the reduced annual compensation
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(17), a defined benefit plan must ``fresh start'' the benefits
of all employees with accrued benefits that are based on compensation that exceeded the annual compensation limit.
In order to implement the reduced limit under OBRA '93, a defined benefit plan must again ``fresh start'' the benefits
of all employees with accrued benefits that are based on compensation that exceeded the OBRA '93 $150,000 compensation
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the proposed regulations, these final regulations provide guidance on the implementation of these and other
multiple fresh starts and coordinate the regulations with the fresh-start rules of the section 401(a)(4) regulations.
For example, the regulations continue to cross-reference the section 401(a)(4) regulations for the definition
of an employee's frozen accrued benefit. Thus, an employee's frozen accrued benefit as of the OBRA '93 effective date
includes benefits accrued as a result of an amendment made within the TRA '86 remedial amendment period that is recognized
under section 401(b) as effective before the OBRA '93 effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Amendments to Comply With Section 401(a)(17) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with publishing these regulations under section 401(a)(17), the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13,
1994&hyph;3 I.R.B. 18, dated January 18, 1994. Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13 provides guidance on the remedial amendment
treatment for plans being amended for section 401(a)(17), including guidance on the conditions under which a plan
may be amended to comply retroactively with section 401(a)(17) even if the amendment results in a reduction of a benefit
protected under section 411(d)(6). Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13 also provides guidance on the extent to which section 204(h)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) will not apply to a plan amendment that limits an employee's
compensation taken into account under the plan to the maximum permitted under section 401(a)(17) of the Code.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commentators requested that this guidance be incorporated into the final regulations. The IRS and the Treasury believe
these issues are appropriately addressed in Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13. The guidance under section 411(d)(6) in Rev.
Proc. 94&hyph;13 is provided pursuant to the specific delegation of authority in &sect;1.411(d)&hyph;4, Q&amp;A&hyph;2(b)
to the Commissioner to provide, through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general
applicability, for the elimination or reduction of section 411(d)(6) protected benefits to the extent that the reduction
is necessary to permit compliance with the other requirements of section 401(a). The guidance under section 204(h)
of ERISA is provided pursuant to the delegation of authority to the IRS under section 101(a) of Reorganization Plan
No. 4 of 1978 (1979&hyph;1 C.B. 480) to issue regulations, rulings, opinions, variances, and waivers under section
204 of ERISA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Application of $150,000 Limit to Accruals or Allocations in Plan Years for Which OBRA '93 is Effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator suggested that the reduced limit should not apply to compensation for years beginning before the
OBRA '93 effective date that is used in determining post-effective date benefit accruals. The regulations, however,
continue to provide that benefits accruing, or allocations made, for plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93
effective date may not take into account compensation for any year in excess of the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit
applicable to that year (generally $150,000 for years beginning before the OBRA '93 effective date). Thus, compensation
for any plan year before OBRA '93 applies to the plan that is used to determine benefits accruing in plan years beginning
on or after the OBRA '93 effective date is generally limited to $150,000. In the absence of this rule, post-effective
date accruals under many defined benefit plans would be determined taking into account compensation in excess of
$150,000. For example, this happens when a defined benefit plan determines annual accruals as a percentage of each
employee's highest average annual compensation for a specified number of years (including years prior to the effective
date of OBRA '93). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Collectively Bargained Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TRA '86 and OBRA '93 provide a deferred effective date for collectively bargained plans. In response to comments,
these regulations clarify that the rules of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;10(a)(2) apply for purposes of determining whether
a plan is a collectively bargained plan. Thus, if a plan is a collectively bargained plan (within the meaning of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;10(a)(2)(iii)),
the deferred effective date applies in determining the plan allocations or benefit accruals of both collectively
bargained and noncollectively bargained employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
e. Governmental Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations retain the special effective date for governmental plans (within the meaning of section
414(d)) in order to provide governmental employers with adequate time to amend their plans to comply with section
401(a)(17). Thus, the regulations provide that these governmental plans will automatically satisfy the requirements
of section 401(a)(17) for plan years beginning before the later of January 1, 1996, or 90 days after the opening of the
first legislative session beginning on or after January 1, 1996, of the governing body with authority to amend the
plan, if that body does not meet continuously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations continue to implement the grandfather rule in OBRA '93 for individuals who first became participants
in governmental plans before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995 or, if earlier, the first plan year
for which the plan is amended to comply with OBRA '93. Under the grandfather rule, the annual compensation limit will
not apply for those individuals to the extent that the limit would reduce the amount of compensation taken into account
under the plan below the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993. However,
in order for this grandfather rule to apply to a plan, the plan must be amended, effective for plan years beginning after
December 31, 1995, to incorporate by reference the annual compensation limits of section 401(a)(17) for those participants
who are not grandfathered under OBRA '93.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
f. Good Faith Compliance Prior to the Regulatory Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For plan years beginning on or after the date that section 401(a)(17) first applies to a plan, but before these regulations
apply to the plan, the plan must be operated in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the requirements
of section 401(a)(17). Whether compliance is reasonable and in good faith will be determined on the basis of all of
the relevant facts and circumstances, including the extent to which the employer has resolved unclear issues in its
favor. Reasonable, good faith interpretation will be deemed to exist, however, if a plan is operated in accordance
with the 1990 regulations, the September 1991 regulations, the December 1993 regulations, or these regulations.
However, for any plan with a regulatory effective date that is later than the OBRA '93 effective date for the plan (e.g.,
a plan maintained by a tax-exempt organization), a reasonable, good faith interpretation must reflect the OBRA '93
amendments to section 401(a)(17).

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

 In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to be a qualified plan, a plan must satisfy section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(a)(17). Section 401(a)(17) provides an annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit for each employee under a qualified plan. This limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies to a qualified plan in two ways. First, a plan may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base allocations, in the case of a defined contribution plan, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit accruals, in the case of a defined benefit plan, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation in excess of the annual compensation limit. Second, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of an employee's annual compensation that may be taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account in applying certain specified nondiscrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules under the Internal Revenue Code is subject to the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit. These two limitations are set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of this section provides the effective dates of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(a)(17), the amendments made by section 13212 of the Omnibus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), and this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-effective-date accrued benefits under the fresh-start rules.

Annual compensation limit for plan years beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before January 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this section, for plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date, annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit means $200,000, adjusted as provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commissioner. The amount of the annual compensation limit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
415(d). The base period for the annual adjustment is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar quarter ending December 31, 1988, and the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment is effective on January 1, 1990. Any increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit is effective as of January 1 of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year and applies to any plan year beginning in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year. In any plan year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date, if compensation for any plan year beginning prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the statutory effective date is used for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations or benefit accruals, or when applying any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiscrimination rule, then the annual compensation limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first plan year beginning on or after the statutory effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date (generally $200,000) must be applied to compensation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that prior plan year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, for plan years beginning on or after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '93 effective date, annual compensation limit means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$150,000, adjusted as provided by the Commissioner. The adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount of the annual compensation limit is determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusting the $150,000 amount for changes in the cost of living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section and rounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this adjusted dollar amount as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. Any increase in the annual compensation limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is effective as of January 1 of a calendar year and applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any plan year beginning in that calendar year. For example, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan has a plan year beginning July 1, 1994, and ending June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, the annual compensation limit in effect on January 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($150,000), applies to the plan for the entire plan year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost of living adjustment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The $150,000 amount is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted for changes in the cost of living by the Commissioner at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same time and in the same manner as under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 415(d). The base period for the annual adjustment is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar quarter ending December 31, 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rounding of adjusted compensation limit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$150,000, adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, exceeds the annual compensation limit for the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year by $10,000 or more, the annual compensation limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be increased by the amount of such excess, rounded down to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next lowest multiple of $10,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional guidance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commissioner may, in revenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not satisfy section 401(a)(17) unless it provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation taken into account for any employee in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan allocations or benefit accruals for any plan year is limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the annual compensation limit. For purposes of this rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations and benefit accruals under a plan include all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits provided under the plan, including ancillary benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph (b), the limit in effect for the current plan year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies only to the compensation for that year that is taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account in determining plan allocations or benefit accruals for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year. The compensation for any prior plan year taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account in determining an employee's allocations or benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accruals for the current plan year is subject to the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit in effect for that prior year. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases in the annual compensation limit apply only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation taken into account for the plan year in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase is effective. In addition, if compensation for any plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining allocations or benefit accruals in a plan year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit for that prior year is the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit in effect for the first plan year beginning on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or after the OBRA '93 effective date (generally $150,000).

_(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of applying this paragraph (b), the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit is applied to the compensation for the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year on which allocations or benefit accruals are based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compensation for the plan year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a plan determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a plan year based on compensation for the plan year, then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit that applies to the compensation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan year is the limit in effect for the calendar year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the plan year begins. Alternatively, if a plan determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the plan year on the basis of compensation for a 12-consecutive-month period, or periods, ending no later than
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the plan year, then the annual compensation limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies to compensation for each of those periods based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit in effect for the respective calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which each 12-month period begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compensation for a period of less than 12-months
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proration required.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If compensation for a period of less than 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months is used for a plan year, then the otherwise applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit is reduced in the same proportion as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reduction in the 12-month period. For example, if a defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit plan provides that the accrual for each month in a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year is separately determined based on the compensation for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month and the plan year accrual is the sum of the accruals for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all months, then the annual compensation limit for each month is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1/12th of the annual compensation limit for the plan year. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, if the period for determining compensation used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating an employee's allocation or accrual for a plan year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a short plan year (i.e., shorter than 12 months), the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which is the number of months in the short plan year, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denominator of which is 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No proration required for participation for less than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full plan year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, a plan is not treated as using compensation for less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 12 months for a plan year merely because the plan formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the allocation or accrual for each employee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on compensation for the portion of the plan year during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the employee is a participant in the plan. In addition, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proration is required merely because an employee is covered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a plan for less than a full plan year, provided that allocations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or benefit accruals are otherwise determined using compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a period of at least 12 months. Finally, notwithstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, no proration is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required merely because the amount of elective contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(within the meaning of &sect;1.401(k)&hyph;1(g)(3)), matching contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(within the meaning of &sect;1.401(m)&hyph;1(f)(12)), or employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions (within the meaning of &sect;1.401(m)&hyph;1(f)(6)) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributed for each pay period during a plan year is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately using compensation for that pay period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 For purposes of this paragraph (b), in the case of a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 413(c) or 414(f) (a plan maintained by more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than one employer), the annual compensation limit applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately with respect to the compensation of an employee from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each employer maintaining the plan instead of applying to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee's total compensation from all employers maintaining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan.

Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Plan X is a defined benefit plan with a calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year plan year and bases benefits on the average of an employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high 3 consecutive years' compensation. The OBRA '93 effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date for Plan X is January 1, 1994. Employee A's high 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive years' compensation prior to the application of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual compensation limits is $160,000 (1994), $155,000 (1993), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and $135,000 (1992). To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan X 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot base plan benefits for Employee A in 1994 on compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in excess of $145,000 (the average of $150,000 (A's 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation capped by the annual compensation limit), $150,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A's 1993 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit applicable to all years before 1994), and $135,000 (A's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit applicable to all years before 1994)). For purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the 1994 accrual, each year (1994, 1993, and 1992), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not the average of the 3 years, is subject to the 1994 annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit of $150,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employee A's high 3 consecutive years' compensation prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the limits is $185,000 (1997), $175,000 (1996), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and $165,000 (1995). Assume that the annual compensation limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years beginning on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after January 1, 1997. Plan X cannot base plan benefits for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employee A in 1997 on compensation in excess of $153,333 (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average of $160,000 (A's 1997 compensation capped by the 1997 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit), $150,000 (A's 1996 compensation capped by the 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit), and $150,000 (A's 1995 compensation capped by the 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 3. Plan Y is a defined benefit plan that bases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits on an employee's high consecutive 36 months of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation ending within the plan year. Employee B's high 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months are the period September 1995 to August 1998, in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employee B earned $50,000 in each month. Assume that the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning on or after January 1, 1997. The annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit is $150,000, $150,000, and $160,000 in 1995, 1996, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1997, respectively. To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan Y cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base Employee B's plan benefits for the 1998 plan year on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation in excess of $153,333. This amount is determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying the applicable annual compensation limit to compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each of the three 12-consecutive-month periods. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1995 to August 1996 period is capped by the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit of $150,000 for 1995; the September 1996 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 1997 period is capped by the annual compensation limit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$150,000 for 1996; and the September 1997 to August 1998 period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is capped by the annual compensation limit of $160,000 for 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average of these capped amounts is the annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit applicable in determining benefits for the 1998 year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Employer P is a partnership. Employer P 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains Plan Z, a profit-sharing plan that provides for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual allocation of employer contributions of 15 percent of plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year compensation for employees other than self-employed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, and 13.0435 percent of plan year compensation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-employed individuals. The plan year of Plan Z is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year. The OBRA '93 effective date for Plan Z is January 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, 1994. In order to satisfy section 401(a)(17), as amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '93, the plan provides that, beginning with the 1994 plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, the plan year compensation used in determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of employer contributions for each employee may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the annual limit in effect for the plan year under OBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
'93. Plan Z defines compensation for self-employed individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1)) as the self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed individual's net profit from self-employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to Employer P minus the amount of the self-employed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's deduction under section 164(f) for one-half of self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment taxes. Plan Z defines compensation for all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees as wages within the meaning of section 3401(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employee C and Employee D are partners of Employer P and thus are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-employed individuals. Neither Employee C nor Employee D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owns an interest in any other business or is a common-law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee in any business. For the 1994 calendar year, Employee C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has net profit from self-employment of $80,000, and Employee D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has net profit from self-employment of $175,000. The deduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Employee C under section 164(f) for one-half of self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment taxes is $4,828. The deduction for Employee D under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 164(f) for one-half of self-employment taxes is $6,101 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The plan year compensation under the plan formula for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employee C is $75,172 ($80,000 minus $4,828). The allocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer contributions under the plan allocation formula for 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Employee C is $9,805 ($75,172 (Employee C's plan year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation for 1994) multiplied by 13.0435%). The plan year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation under the plan formula before application of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual limit under section 401(a)(17) for Employee D is $168,899 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($175,000 minus $6101). After application of the annual limit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan year compensation for the 1994 plan year for Employee D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is $150,000 (the annual limit for 1994). Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of employer contributions under the plan allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula for 1994 for Employee D is $19,565 ($150,000 (Employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D's plan year compensation after application of the annual limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1994) multiplied by 13.0435%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Plan Z provides that plan year compensation for self-employed individuals is defined as earned income within
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of section 401(c)(2) attributable to Employer P. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, Plan Z provides for an annual allocation of employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions of 15 percent of plan year compensation for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in the plan, including self-employed individuals, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as Employees C and D. The net profit from self-employment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employee C and the net profit from self-employment for Employee D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are the same as provided in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, the earned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income of Employee C determined in accordance with section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(c)(2) is $65,367 ($80,000 minus $4,828 minus $9,805). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned income of Employee D determined in accordance with section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(c)(2) is $146,869 ($175,000 minus $6,101 minus $22,030). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the allocation of employer contributions under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan allocation formula for 1994 for Employee C is $9,805 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($65,367 (Employee C's plan year compensation for 1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplied by 15%). Employee D's earned income for 1994 does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the 1994 annual limit of $150,000. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of employer contributions under the plan allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula for 1994 for Employee D is $22,030 ($146,869 (Employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D's plan year compensation for 1994) multiplied by 15%).

Limit on compensation for nondiscrimination rules

_(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual compensation limit applies for purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of applying the nondiscrimination rules under sections 401(a)(4), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401(a)(5), 401(l), 401(k)(3), 401(m)(2), 403(b)(12), 404(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 410(b)(2). The annual compensation limit also applies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether an alternative method of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation impermissibly discriminates under section 414(s)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, the annual compensation limit applies when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining a self-employed individual's total earned income that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used to determine the equivalent alternative compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount under &sect;1.414(s)&hyph;1(g)(1). This paragraph (c) provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for applying the annual compensation limit for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (c), compensation means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the compensation used in applying the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiscrimination rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph (c), when applying an applicable nondiscrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule for a plan year, the compensation for each plan year taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account is limited to the applicable annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit in effect for that year, and an employee's compensation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that plan year in excess of the limit is disregarded. Thus, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nondiscrimination provision is applied on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation determined over a period of more than one year (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, average annual compensation), the annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit in effect for each of the plan years that is taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account in determining the average applies to the respective plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year's compensation. In addition, if compensation for any plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying any nondiscrimination rule in a plan year beginning on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or after the OBRA '93 effective date, then the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation limit for that prior year is the annual compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the OBRA '93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date (generally $150,000).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plan-by-plan limit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this paragraph (c), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the annual compensation limit applies separately to each plan (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of plans treated as a single plan) of an employer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the applicable nondiscrimination requirement. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this purpose, the plans included in the testing group taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account in determining whether the average benefit percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;5 is satisfied are generally treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

benefits without any reference to a limit on compensation, then the annual compensation limit in effect under this
section will not apply to any eligible participant in any future year.

current accrued benefit as of that date is based on compensation for a year prior to the statutory effective date that
exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the statutory effective date.
In addition, an employee is a section 401(a)(17) employee as of a date, on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, if the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to satisfy section 401(a)(17), a defined benefit plan must determine the accrued benefit of each section
401(a)(17) employee by applying the fresh-start rules in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c). The fresh-start rules
must be applied using a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date and using the plan benefit formula, after amendment to
comply with section 401(a)(17) and this section, as the formula applicable to benefit accruals in the current plan
year. In addition, the fresh-start rules must be applied to determine the accrued benefit of each section 401(a)(17)
employee using an OBRA '93 fresh-start date and using the plan benefit formula, after amendment to comply with the
reduction in the section 401(a)(17) annual compensation limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as
the formula applicable to benefit accruals in the current plan year.

In applying the fresh-start rules of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c) and (d), the group of section 401(a)(17) employees
is a fresh-start group. See &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(5)(ii)(A). Thus, the consistency rules of those sections
govern, unless otherwise provided. For example, if the plan is using a fresh-start date applicable to all employees
and is not adjusting frozen accrued benefits under &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d) for employees who are not section
401(a)(17) employees, then the frozen accrued benefits for section 401(a)(17) employees may not be adjusted under
&sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d) or this paragraph (e).

If the fresh-start rules of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c) and (d) are applied to determine the benefits of all employees
after a fresh-start date, the plan will not fail to satisfy the consistency requirement of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(5)(i)
merely because the plan makes the adjustment described in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d) to the frozen accrued benefits
of employees who are not section 401(a)(17) employees, but does not make the adjustment to the frozen accrued benefits
of section 401(a)(17) employees. In addition, the plan does not fail to satisfy the consistency requirement of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(5)(i)
merely because the plan makes the adjustment described in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d) for section 401(a)(17)
employees on the basis of the compensation formula that was used to determine the frozen accrued benefit (as required
under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section) but makes the adjustment for employees who are not section 401(a)(17)
employees on the basis of any other method provided in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the plan adjusts accrued benefits for employees under the rules of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d) as of a fresh-start
date, the adjusted accrued benefit (within the meaning of section &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)) for each section
401(a)(17) employee must be determined after the fresh-start date by reference to the plan's compensation formula
that was actually used to determine the frozen accrued benefit as of the fresh-start date. For this purpose, the plan's
compensation formula incorporates the plan's underlying compensation definition and compensation averaging
period. In making the adjustment, the denominator of the adjustment fraction described in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8)(i)
is the employee's compensation as of the fresh-start date using the plan's compensation formula as of that date and,
in the case of an OBRA '93 fresh-start date, reflecting the annual compensation limits that applied as of the fresh-start
date. The numerator of the adjustment fraction is the employee's updated compensation (i.e., compensation for the
current plan year within the meaning of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8)), determined after applying the annual
compensation limits to each year's compensation that is used in the plan's compensation formula as of the fresh-start
date. Similarly, in applying the alternative rule in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8)(v), the updated compensation
that is substituted must be determined after applying the annual compensation limits to each year's compensation
that is used in the plan's compensation formula. Thus, no adjustment will be permitted unless the updated compensation
(determined after applying the annual compensation limit) exceeds the compensation that was used to determine the
employee's frozen accrued benefit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple fresh starts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a plan makes more than one fresh start with respect to a section 401(a)(17) employee, the employee's frozen accrued
benefit as of the latest fresh-start date will either be determined by applying the current benefit formula to the
employee's total years of service as of that fresh-start date or will consist of the sum of the employee's frozen accrued
benefit (or adjusted accrued benefit (as defined in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8)(i))) as of the previous fresh-start
date plus additional frozen accruals since the previous fresh start. If the frozen accrued benefit consists of such
a sum, in making the adjustments described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, separate adjustments must
be made to that previously frozen accrued benefit (or adjusted accrued benefit) and the additional frozen accruals
to the extent that the frozen accrued benefit and the additional accruals have been determined using different compensation
formulas or different compensation limits (i.e., the section 401(a)(17) limit before and after the reduction in
limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section). In this case, if the plan is applying the adjustment fraction
of &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8)(i), the denominator of the separate adjustment fraction for adjusting each
portion of the frozen accrued benefit must reflect the actual compensation formula, and, if applicable, compensation
limit, originally used for determining that portion. For example, the frozen accrued benefit of a section 401(a)(17)
employee as of the OBRA '93 fresh-start date may be based on the sum of the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit
(determined without any annual compensation limit) plus benefit accruals in the years between the statutory effective
date and the OBRA '93 effective date (based on compensation that was subject to the annual compensation limits for
those years). In this example, in adjusting the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit, the denominator of the
adjustment fraction does not reflect any annual compensation limit. Similarly, in adjusting the frozen accruals
for years between the statutory effective date and the OBRA '93 effective date, the denominator of the adjustment
fraction reflects the level of the annual compensation limit in effect for those years.

(a) Employer X maintains Plan Y, a calendar year defined benefit plan providing an annual benefit for each year of service
equal to 2 percent of compensation averaged over an employee's high 3 consecutive calendar years' compensation.
Section 401(a)(17) applies to Plan Y in 1989. As of the close of the last plan year beginning before January 1, 1989 (i.e.,
the 1988 plan year), Employee A, with 5 years of service, had accrued a benefit of $25,000 which equals 10 percent (2
percent multiplied by 5 years of service) of average compensation of $250,000. Employer X decides to comply with the
provisions of this section for plan years before the effective date of this section. Employer X decides to make the
amendment effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, and uses December 31, 1988 as the section
401(a)(17) fresh-start date. Plan Y, as amended, provides that, in determining an employee's benefit, compensation
taken into account is limited in accordance with the provisions of this section to the annual compensation limit under
section 401(a)(17), and that, for section 401(a)(17) employees, the employee's accrued benefit is the greater of

Employer X decides not to amend Plan Y to provide for the adjustments permitted under &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Under Plan Y, Employee A's accrued benefit at the end of 1989 is $25,000, which is the greater of Employee A's accrued
benefit as of the last day of the 1988 plan year ($25,000), and $24,000, which is Employee A's benefit based on the plan's
benefit formula applied to Employee A's total years of service ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 6
years of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued
benefits for years after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in &sect;1.401(a)&hyph;13(c)(4)(ii)
(formula with wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies
section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17)
fresh-start date within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.

except that the plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, for section 401(a)(17) employees, an employee's
benefit will equal the sum of the employee's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988 (determined as though the employee
terminated employment on that date and without regard to any amendments after that date), and 2 percent of compensation
averaged over an employee's high 3 consecutive years' compensation times years of service taking into account only
years of service after December 31, 1988. Thus, under Plan Y's formula, Employee A's accrued benefit as of December
31, 1989 is $29,000, which is equal to the sum of $25,000 (Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988) plus
$4,000 ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 1 year of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section
401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start
date is the formula in &sect;1.401(a)&hyph;13(c)(4)(i) (formula without wear-away). The fresh-start formula
is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the
December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date within the meaning of
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for
plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Assume the same facts as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that the plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, an employee's benefit equals the greater of
the plan formulas in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years
after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in &sect;1.401(a)&hyph;13(c)(4)(iii) (formula with
extended wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies
section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17)
fresh-start date within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Assume that for each of the years 1991&hyph;93 Employee A's annual compensation under the plan compensation formula,
disregarding the amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17) is $300,000. The annual compensation limit is adjusted
to $222,220, $228,860, and $235,840 for plan years beginning January 1, 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. Because
Employer X has decided to amend Plan Y to comply with the provisions of this section effective for plan years beginning
on or after January 1, 1989, and has used December 31, 1988 as the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date, the compensation
that may be taken into account for plan benefits in 1993 cannot exceed $228,973 (the average of $222,220, $228,860,
and $235,840). Therefore, as of December 31, 1993, the benefit determined under the fresh-start formula with wear-away
would be $45,795 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 10 years of service)). The benefit determined under
the fresh-start formula without wear-away would be $47,897, which is equal to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17)
frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)). Because
Employee A's accrued benefit is being determined using the fresh-start formula with extended wear-away, Employee
A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is equal to $47,897, the greater of the two amounts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Assume the same facts as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that Plan Y satisfies &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(3) through (d)(7) and that the amendment to Plan Y effective
for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, also provided for adjustments to the section 401(a)(17) frozen
accrued benefit in accordance with &sect;1.401(a)(4)-13(d) using the fraction described in &sect;1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As of December 31, 1993, the numerator of Employee A's compensation fraction is $228,973 (the average of Employee
A's annual compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993, as limited by the respective annual limit for each of those years).
The denominator of Employee A's compensation fraction determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this
section is $250,000 (the average of Employee A's high 3 consecutive calendar year compensation as of December 31,
1988, determined without regard to section 401(a)(17)). Therefore, Employee A's compensation fraction is $228,973/$250,000.
Because the compensation adjustment fraction is less than 1, Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit
is not adjusted. Therefore, Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, would still be $47,897, which is
equal to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by
(2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that as of January 1, 1994, Plan Y is amended to provide that benefits will be determined based on compensation
of $150,000 (the limit in effect under section 401(a)(17) for plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective
date) and that for section 401(a)(17) employees, each employee's accrued benefit will be determined under &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(4)(i)
(formula without wear-away) using December 31, 1993 as the OBRA '93 fresh-start date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Assume that for each of the years 1996&hyph;98 Employee A's annual compensation under the plan compensation definition,
disregarding the amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17), is $400,000. Assume that the annual compensation
limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, and is not adjusted for the
plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1998. The compensation that may be taken into account for the 1998 plan year
cannot exceed $156,667 (the average of $150,000 for 1996, $160,000 for 1997, and $160,000 for 1998).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Therefore, at the end of December 31, 1998, Employee A's accrued benefit is $63,564, which is equal to $47,897 (Employee
A's OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit) plus $15,667 ($156,667 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that, for the fresh-start group (in this case the section 401(a)(17) employees), the amendments to Plan Y provide
for adjustments to the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit and the OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit in accordance
with &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d) using the fraction described in &sect;1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(d)(8)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Employee A's frozen accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is adjusted as of December 31, 1998, as follows: (1)
Employee A's frozen accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is the sum of Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued
benefit ($25,000) and Employee A's frozen accruals for the years 1989&hyph;93 ($22,897).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The numerator of Employee A's adjustment fraction is $156,667 (the average of $150,000, $160,000, and $160,000).
The denominator of Employee A's adjustment fraction with respect to Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued
benefit is $250,000, and the denominator of Employee A's adjustment fraction with respect to the rest of Employee
A's frozen accrued benefit is $228,973 (the average of Employee A's annual compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993,
as limited by the respective annual limit for each of those years).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit as adjusted through December 31, 1998, remains $25,000.
The compensation adjustment fraction determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section is less
than one ($156,667 divided by $250,000).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Employee A's frozen accruals for the years 1989&hyph;93, as adjusted through December 31, 1998, remain $22,897
because the adjustment fraction is less than one ($156,667 divided by $228,973).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Employee A's adjusted accrued benefit as of December 31, 1998, equals $47,897 (the sum of the $25,000 and $22,897
amounts from paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit will not be adjusted for compensation increases until
the numerator of the fraction used to adjust that frozen accrued benefit exceeds the denominator of $250,000 used
in determining those accruals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the portion of Employee A's OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit attributable to the frozen accruals for the
years 1989&hyph;1993 will not be adjusted for compensation increases until the numerator of the fraction used to
adjust those frozen accruals exceeds the denominator of $228,973 used in determining those accruals.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains amendments to the final regulations under section 414(r) of the Internal Revenue Code, which
provide that an employer may be treated as operating separate lines of business for purposes of applying the minimum
coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26). The
regulations reflect the enactment of section 414(r) by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent changes made by the
Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 and the Public Debt Limit Increase Act of 1989. The regulations provide
guidance necessary to comply with the law and affect sponsors of and participants in tax-qualified retirement plans
and certain other employee benefit plans.

1. Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, all employees of a single employer, determined under section 414 of the Code, are taken into account for
purposes of applying the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements
of section 401(a)(26) to a qualified plan. Section 410(b)(5) provides an exception if an employer operates qualified
separate lines of business under section 414(r). If the employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines
of business, section 410(b)(5) generally permits the employer to apply the minimum coverage requirements separately
with respect to the employees of each qualified separate line of business. A similar exception is provided for purposes
of applying the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26) and the 55-percent average benefits test
of section 129(d)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business if (1) the employer designates its lines
of business by reference to the property or services provided by each line, (2) each line of business is organized and
operated separately from the remainder of the employer, and (3) each of these separate lines of business meets additional
statutory requirements (including administrative scrutiny) and thus constitutes a qualified separate line of
business. Each employee of an employer that operates qualified separate lines of business is assigned to a particular
line of business for purposes of nondiscrimination testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The September 1993 proposed regulations amend the final regulations under section 414(r) generally to address issues
raised since the publication of the final regulations. The proposed regulations include the following major changes:

In general, comments received on the changes included in the proposed regulations were favorable. Accordingly,
these final regulations incorporate those changes. In addition, in response to comments, certain further modifications
have been made to the regulations. The more significant modifications are discussed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the comments received on the September 1993 proposed regulations pertained to the allocation of residual
shared employees, that is, employees who provide services to more than one qualified separate line of business and
who are not substantial-service employees with respect to any line of business. The December 1991 regulations provide
three alternative allocation methods for residual shared employees, which are intended to assure that, as a group,
residual shared employees receive benefits representative of the benefits provided to the workforce generally.

Under the dominant line of business method, all residual shared employees are allocated to the employer's dominant
line of business. Generally, a qualified separate line of business is dominant if at least 50 percent of the employer's
substantial-service employees are assigned to that line. Alternatively, a line of business may be dominant if at
least 35 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees are assigned to that line and the line satisfies
any one of four possible conditions, such as a certain level of revenue or a certain size compared with the employer's
other lines. The other two allocation methods, the pro-rata method and the highly compensated employee (HCE) percentage
ratio method, provide formulas under which residual shared employees are allocated among the employer's various
qualified separate lines of business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employers have commented that the allocation rules do not adequately accommodate current benefit arrangements
for employees who provide services to more than one qualified separate line of business. For example, the employer
might cover residual shared employees in the plan maintained for a line that the employer considers its core business,
even though that line does not satisfy the dominant line of business standard. Residual shared employees therefore
cannot all be allocated to that line, potentially causing a change in their benefits. Employers also have commented
that the pro-rata and HCE percentage ratio methods may require employees in the same department to be allocated to
different qualified separate lines of business, which in turn may require different benefits to be provided to employees
who work together.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, these final regulations change the allocation rules in two ways. First, the standard for
the alternative test of dominance is lowered from 35 percent to 25 percent, giving employers more flexibility in establishing
a dominant line. Second, the regulations provide an additional allocation alternative, the small group method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the small group method, with respect to each residual shared employee, the employer chooses a qualified separate
line of business to which the employee is allocated. The residual shared employees need not all be allocated to the
same qualified separate line of business; the employer thus has great flexibility in selecting the plans under which
residual shared employees benefit. In order to prevent this new allocation method from being used to provide highly
compensated employees with excessive benefits relative to the nonhighly compensated employees, its use is subject
to three requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the entire group of the employer's residual shared employees cannot exceed three percent of the employees
taken into account in applying section 410(b). In addition, the qualified separate line of business to which the employer
allocates a residual shared employee must include at least 10 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees
and must satisfy the administrative scrutiny statutory safe harbor after the allocation, that is, the concentration
of highly compensated employees in the line of business must be between 50 and 200 percent of the concentration of highly
compensated employees in the workforce generally. Finally, the allocation of residual shared employees must be
reasonable; criteria for determining whether an allocation is reasonable are set forth in the regulations.

3. Gateway

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 410(b)(5)(B) provides that separate-line-of-business testing does not apply to a plan unless the plan benefits
such employees as qualify under a classification that is set up by the employer and is found not to discriminate in favor
of highly compensated employees. Because the employer-wide nondiscriminatory classification test of section
410(b)(5)(B) is a prerequisite to separate-line-of-business testing, it is sometimes referred to as the ``Gateway.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December 1991 regulations, the Gateway is applied in the same basic manner as the nondiscriminatory classification
test under the section 410(b) regulations. Those regulations establish an unsafe harbor ratio percentage for a plan,
that is, a minimum ratio of the relative coverage rates of nonhighly compensated and highly compensated employees.
The unsafe harbor percentage applicable to a plan depends on the concentration of nonhighly compensated employees
in the employer's workforce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a qualified separate line of business has a disproportionate share of the employer's highly compensated employees,
the plan maintained for that line of business may have a very low ratio percentage on an employer-wide basis, even though
it covers a high percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees in that line. The December 1991 regulations therefore
provide a reduced unsafe harbor percentage if the plan has a ratio percentage of at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business
basis. Although most plans pass the Gateway test in its current form, some commentators on the September 1993 proposed
regulations have noted continued difficulty in the case of plans maintained for certain lines of business that cover
a high percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees in those lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to those comments, these final regulations provide that, if a plan has a ratio percentage of at least 90
percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, but its employer-wide ratio percentage falls below the
plan's reduced unsafe harbor percentage, the plan nonetheless is deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide
basis if the Commissioner determines that, based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits
such employees as qualify under a classification of employees that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated
employees. For this purpose, included among the relevant facts and circumstances are facts and circumstances such
as those listed in &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(c)(3)(ii). In making these determinations, the Commissioner will determine
which other facts and circumstances are relevant, including any of the facts and circumstances listed in section
5 of Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;41, 1993&hyph;2 C.B. 536, that the Commissioner determines are relevant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A concern has been raised that the anti-cutback rules of section 411(d)(6) might eliminate an employer's option to
comply with the nondiscrimination requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (including the provisions of section
414(r)) and related legislation by amending its plans in the 1994 plan year to reduce the level of benefits provided
to highly compensated employees for that year. Employers are reminded that Notice 92&hyph;36, 1992&hyph;2 C.B.
364, provided broad transition relief giving employers the opportunity to retain their amendment options until
the last day of the 1994 plan year without being treated as violating section 411(d)(6).

It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

 If employees benefiting under a plan change from one disaggregation population to a second disaggregation population,
benefits they accrue while members of the second disaggregation population that are attributable to years of service
previously credited while the employees were members of the first disaggregation population may be treated as provided
to them in their status as members of the first disaggregation population and thus included in the portion of the plan
benefiting employees of the first disaggregation population. This special treatment is available only if it is applied
on a consistent basis, if it does not result in significant discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees,
and if the plan provision providing the additional benefits applies on the same terms to all similarly-situated employees.
For example, if all formerly collectively bargained employees accrue additional benefits under a plan after becoming
noncollectively bargained employees, then those benefit increases may be treated as included in the portion of the
plan benefiting collectively bargained employees if they are attributable to years of service credited while the
employees were collectively bargained (e.g., where the additional benefits result from compensation increases
that occur while the employees are noncollectively bargained or from plan amendments affecting benefits earned
while collectively bargained that are adopted while the employees are noncollectively bargained) and if such treatment
does not result in significant discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees.

 If, in previous years, the configuration of a plan's disaggregation populations differed from their configuration
for the current year, for purposes of the benefits accrued by, or allocations made to, an employee for those years,
the employee's status as a member of a current disaggregation population for those years must be determined on a reasonable
basis. A different configuration occurs, for example, if disaggregation populations exist for the first time, such
as when an employer is first treated as operating qualified separate lines of business, or if the existing disaggregation
populations change, such as when an employer redesignates its qualified separate lines of business.

 (a) Employer X operates Divisions M and N, which are treated as qualified separate lines of business for the first time
in 1998. Thus, the disaggregation populations of employees of Division M and employees of Division N exist for the
first time. Since 1981 Employer X has maintained a defined benefit plan, Plan P, for employees of Division M. Plan P
provides a normal retirement benefit of one percent of average annual compensation for each year of service up to 25.
Employee A has worked for Division M since 1981 and has never worked for Division N. Employee B has worked for Division
N since 1989 and worked for Division M from 1981 to 1988. Employee C has worked in the headquarters of Employer X since
1981. For the period 1981 to 1988 Employee C was credited with years of service under Plan P.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of the benefits accrued by Employee A under Plan P during years 1981 through 1997, Employee A is reasonably
treated as having been a member of the Division M disaggregation population for those years. For purposes of the benefits
accrued by Employee B under Plan P during years 1981 through 1988, Employee B is reasonably treated as having been a
member of the Division M disaggregation population for 1981 through 1988 and as having changed to the Division N disaggregation
population for 1989 through 1997. For purposes of the benefits accrued by Employee C under Plan P during years 1981
through 1988, Employee C is reasonably treated as having been a member of the Division M disaggregation population
for those years. Moreover, any benefit accruals for Employee B and Employee C in years after 1988, that result from
increases in average annual compensation after 1988 and that are attributable to years of service credited for 1981
through 1988, may be treated as provided to Employee B and Employee C in their status as members of the Division M disaggregation
population if the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C)(

Plan benefiting employees of qualified separate lines of business.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business for purposes of section 410(b) in accordance
with &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;1(b), and a plan benefits employees of more than one qualified separate line of business,
the employees of each qualified separate line of business are separate disaggregation populations. In this case,
the portion of the plan benefiting the employees of each qualified separate line of business is treated as a separate
plan maintained by that qualified separate line of business. However, employees of different qualified separate
lines of business who are benefiting under a plan that is tested under the special rule for employer-wide plans in &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;1(c)(2)(ii)
for a plan year are not separate disaggregation populations merely because they are employees of different qualified
separate lines of business.

Plan benefiting collectively bargained employees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a plan benefits both collectively bargained employees and noncollectively bargained employees, the collectively
bargained employees are one disaggregation population and the noncollectively bargained employees are another
disaggregation population. If the population of collectively bargained employees includes employees covered
under different collective bargaining agreements, the population of employees covered under each collective bargaining
agreement is also a separate disaggregation population.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plan maintained by more than one employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a plan benefits employees of more than one employer, the employees of each employer are separate disaggregation
populations. In this case, the portion of the plan benefiting the employees of each employer is treated as a separate
plan maintained by that employer, which must satisfy section 410(b) by reference only to that employer's employees.
However, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C), if the plan of one employer (or, in the case of a plan maintained
by more than one employer, the plan provisions applicable to the employees of one employer) treats compensation or
service with another employer as compensation or service with the first employer, then the current accruals attributable
to that compensation or service are treated as provided to an employee of the first employer under the plan of the first
employer (or the portion of a plan maintained by more than one employer benefiting employees of the first employer),
and the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section do not apply to those accruals. Thus, for example, if
Plan A maintained by Employer X imputes service or compensation for an employee of Employer Y, then Plan A is not treated
as benefiting the employees of more than one employer merely because of this imputation.

Additional rule for plans benefiting employees of more than one qualified separate line of business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a plan benefiting employees of more than one qualified separate line of business satisfies the reasonable classification
requirement of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(b) before the application of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, then any portion
of the plan that is treated as a separate plan as a result of the application of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) and (ii)(A)
of this section is deemed to satisfy that requirement.

 The number of employees who are in the top-paid group for a year is equal to 20 percent of the total number of active employees
of the employer for such year. However, solely for purposes of determining the total number of active employees in
the top-paid group for a year, the employees described in &sect;1.414(q)&hyph;1T, A&hyph;9(b)(1) (i), (ii) and
(iii)(B) are disregarded. Paragraph (g) of this A&hyph;9 provides rules for determining those employees who are
excluded for purposes of applying section 414(r)(2)(A), relating to the 50-employee requirement applicable to
a qualified separate line of business.

 The elections in this paragraph (b)(2) must be provided for in all plans of the employer and must be uniform and consistent
with respect to all situations in which the section 414(q) definition is applicable to the employer. Thus, with respect
to all plan years beginning in the same calendar year, the employer must apply the test uniformly for purposes of determining
its top-paid group with respect to all its qualified plans and employee benefit plans. If either election is changed
during the determination year, no recalculation of the look-back year based on the new election is required, provided
the change in election does not result in discrimination in operation.

In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Property, whether real or personal, tangible or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intangible, is provided by an employer to a customer if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer provides the property to or on behalf of the customer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for consideration. Similarly, services are provided by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to a customer if the employer renders the services to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behalf of the customer for consideration. An individual item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of property or service is taken into account under this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) only if the employer provides the item to a person other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the employer in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted by the employer and the person to whom the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the item is acting in the capacity of a customer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer. A type of tangible property is deemed to be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to customers of the employer for purposes of this section if, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to a business that produces or manufactures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of tangible property, the employer satisfies the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule in &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;3(d)(2)(iii)(B) for vertically integrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses.

Timing of provision of property or services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an employer determines its lines of business on the basis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property and services it provides to its customers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration during the testing year. However, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary both that property or services actually be provided, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that consideration for the property or services actually be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid, during the current testing year. For an employer to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to provide property or services to customers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration during a testing year under this paragraph (b)(2), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is sufficient that the property or services actually be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to customers during the testing year, the consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually be paid during the testing year, or the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually incur significant costs during the testing year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the provision of the property or services to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified customer or specified customers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Employer H operates several dairy farms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy product processing plants. The dairy farms provide part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their output of milk and milk by-products to Employer H's dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product processing plants and also sell part to retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors unrelated to Employer H. The dairy farms' provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of milk and milk by-products to Employer H's dairy product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plants does not constitute the provision of property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or services to customers of Employer H because the milk and milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by-products are not provided to a person other than employer H. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the dairy farms' provision of milk and milk by-products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to independent retail distributors does constitute the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of property or services to customers of Employer H under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the dairy farms provide their entire output of milk and milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by-products to Employer H's dairy product processing plants. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy farms' provision of milk and milk by-products to the dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product processing plants generally does not constitute the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of property or services to customers of Employer H 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the milk and milk by-products are not provided to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person other than Employer H. However, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section provides a special rule for vertically integrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses that satisfy &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;3(d)(2)(iii)(B). If &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;3(d)(2)(iii)(B) is
satisfied, then, under the special rule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the milk and milk by-products are deemed to be provided to customers of Employer
H.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) Employer C operates three lines of business as determined under &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;2. One of its lines of business
is the operation of a chain of athletic equipment and apparel stores. Of Employer C's total workforce, 12,000 employees
provide more than a negligible amount of the services they provide to Employer C to the athletic equipment and apparel
stores line of business, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Of the 1,200 employees who constitute
the top ten percent by compensation of those 12,000 employees, 930 are substantial-service employees with respect
to that line of business. Because 930 is 77.5 percent of 1,200, less than 80 percent of the top-paid employees with respect
to the line of business are substantial-service employees with respect to that line of business. Therefore, Employer
C's athletic equipment and apparel stores line of business does not have its own separate management under paragraph
(b)(5) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Assume that, in determining the top-paid employees with respect to the athletic equipment and apparel stores
line of business, Employer C chooses to disregard all employees who provide less than 25 percent of their services
to the line of business as permitted under the definition in &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;11(b)(3). Of the 12,000 employees
who provide more than a negligible amount of their services to the athletic equipment and apparel stores line of business,
10,000 provide at least 25 percent of their services to that line. Of the 1,000 employees who constitute the top ten
percent by compensation of those 10,000 employees, 930 are substantial-service employees with respect to the athletic
equipment and apparel stores line of business. Because 930 is 93 percent of 1,000, at least 80 percent of the top-paid
employees with respect to the line of business are substantial-service employees with respect to that line of business.
Therefore, Employer C's athletic equipment and apparel stores line of business has its own separate management and
satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

Example 2

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except that Employee X provides 60 percent of his services to Employer C's second line of business, an athletic equipment
factory, and 30 percent of his service to Employer C's third line of business, a fast-food chain. Because Employee
X provides at least 50 percent of his services to the athletic equipment factory line of business, Employer C chooses
to treat him as a substantial- service employee with respect to that line of business, as permitted under &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;11(b)(2).
Thus, Employee X is taken into account as a substantial-service employee with respect to the athletic equipment factory
line of business and is disregarded in applying the separate workforce and separate management requirements under
paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) to the fast-food chain line of business.

 Two lines of business satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d) with respect to a type of property or service only
if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One of the lines of business (the upstream line of business) provides a type of property or service to the other line
of business (the downstream line of business);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The downstream line of business either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Uses, consumes, or substantially modifies the property or service in the course of itself providing property
or services to customers of the employer; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Provides the same property or service to customers of the employer at a different level in the chain of commercial
distribution from the upstream line of business (e.g., retail versus wholesale); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The upstream line of business either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Provides the same type of property or service to customers of the employer, and at least 25 percent of the total number
of units of the same type of property or service provided by the upstream line of business to all persons (including
customers of the employer, the downstream line of business, and all other lines of business of the employer) are provided
to customers of the employer by the upstream line of business, when measured on a uniform basis; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Provides to the downstream line of business property consisting primarily of a type of tangible property (i.e.,
goods, not services) that it produces or manufactures, and some entities outside the employer's controlled group
that are engaged in a similar business as the upstream line of business provide the same type of tangible property to
unrelated customers (i.e., customers outside those entities' respective controlled groups).

 Employer E operates two lines of business as determined under &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;2, one engaged in upholstery
textile manufacturing and the other in furniture manufacturing. During the testing year, the upholstery textile
line of business provides its entire output of upholstery textiles to the furniture line of business. The furniture
line of business uses the upholstery textiles in the manufacture of upholstered furniture for sale to customers of
Employer E. The furniture line of business thus substantially modifies the upholstery textiles provided to it by
the upholstery textile line of business in providing upholstered furniture products to customers of Employer E.
In addition, although the upholstery textile line of business does not provide upholstery textiles to customers
of Employer E, some entities engaged in upholstery textile manufacturing provide upholstery textiles to customers
outside their controlled groups. Under these facts, Employer E's two lines of business satisfy the requirements
of this paragraph (d) with respect to upholstery textiles for the testing year.

this section occurs after the first testing day in a testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, the determinations required by paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) (B) and

Example 2.

The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, by the first testing day in 1997 (Transition Year 1), there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are 300 additional substantial-service employees with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pharmaceutical supplies line of business, increasing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total number to 4,300. Of those 300 employees, 250 were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial-service employees with respect to a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate line of business for testing year 1996 and 50 are new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hires. Assume that, on the first testing day in Transition Year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, the pharmaceutical supplies line of business satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;3 (taking into account &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;1(d)(4)) and therefore constitutes
a separate line of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because 250 is 6 percent of 4,300, no more than ten percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employees who are substantial-service employees with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the pharmaceutical supplies line of business were substantial- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service employees with respect to a different separate line of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business for the immediately preceding testing year. The 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly hired employees are disregarded in making this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. Under these facts, the pharmaceutical supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate line of business satisfies the safe harbor in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) for Transition Year 1.

a plan provides a defined benefit minimum that uses more than

Option to apply reduced percentage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An employer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to determine whether it has a dominant line of business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by substituting 25 percent for 50 percent in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. This option is available for a testing year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the qualified separate line of business satisfies one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The qualified separate line of business accounts for at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 60 percent of the employer's gross revenues for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer's latest fiscal year ending in the testing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The employee assignment percentage of the qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate line of business would be at least 60 percent if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collectively bargained employees were taken into account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Each qualified separate line of business of the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the statutory safe harbor of &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;5(b), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average benefits safe harbor of &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;5(f), or the minimum or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum benefits safe harbor of &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;5(g). Whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified separate line of business satisfies one of these safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbors is determined after the application of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the assignment of all residual shared employees under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph (c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The employee assignment percentage of the qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate line of business is at least twice the employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assignment percentages of each of the employer's other qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate lines of business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation provided for in this paragraph (c)(5), each residual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shared employee is allocated to a qualified separate line of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business chosen by the employer. This method does not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless all of the requirements of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii), (iii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (iv) of this section are satisfied.

 The total number of the employer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual shared employees allocated under this paragraph (c) must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed three percent of all of the employer's employees. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this purpose, the employer's employees include only those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees taken into account under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Composition of qualified separate line of business.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The qualified separate line of business to which the residual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shared employee is allocated must have an employee assignment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section of at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least ten percent. In addition, the qualified separate line of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business to which the residual shared employee is allocated must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the statutory safe harbor under &sect;1.414(r)&hyph;5(b) after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee is so allocated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable allocation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The allocation of residual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shared employees under the small group method provided for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph (c)(5) must be reasonable. Reasonable allocations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally include allocations that are based on the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services that the residual shared employees provide to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer's qualified separate lines of business, the similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of similarly situated residual shared employees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other bona fide business criteria; in contrast, an allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is designed to maximize benefits for select employees is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a reasonable allocation. For example, allocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all residual shared employees who work in the same department, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the same location, to the same qualified separate line of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business would be an indication of reasonableness. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of a group of similarly situated residual shared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees to a qualified separate line of business for which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide minimal services might not be considered reasonable. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the allocation of the professional employees of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
department to one qualified separate line of business and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of the support staff of the same department to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different qualified separate line of business would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a plan benefits a group of employees for a plan year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would satisfy the ratio percentage test of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;2(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3) of this section if the percentage in &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;2(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were increased to 90 percent, the unsafe harbor percentage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(c)(4)(ii) for the plan is reduced by five percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points (not five percent) for the plan year and is applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without regard to the requirement that the unsafe harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage not be less than 20 percent. Thus, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) are satisfied, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsafe harbor percentage in &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(c)(4)(ii) is treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35 percent, reduced by 3/4 of a percentage point for each whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage point by which the nonhighly compensated employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration percentage exceeds 60 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, but has a ratio percentage on an employer-wide basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that falls below the unsafe harbor percentage determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the plan nonetheless is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the Commissioner determines that, on the basis of all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees as qualify under a classification of employees that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.

Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 All of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 50 highly compensated employees treated as employees of Line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 benefit under Plan Y, and 80 of the 100 nonhighly compensated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees treated as employees of Line 2 benefit under Plan Y. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all Employer A's highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensated employees (50 out of 100) and only 4 percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees (80 out of 2,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, while Plan Y has a ratio percentage of 80 percent (80%
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
100%) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, it has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio percentage of only 8 percent (4%
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
50%) on an employer-wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. See &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;9. Under &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(c)(4)(iii), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhighly compensated employee concentration percentage is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2,000/2,100 or 95 percent. Because 8 percent is less than 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent (the unsafe harbor percentage applicable to Employer A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(c)(4)(ii)), Plan Y does not satisfy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiscriminatory classification test of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4 on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer-wide basis. Nor does Plan Y satisfy the ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage test of &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;2(b)(2) on an employer-wide basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since 8 percent is less than 70 percent. Under these facts, Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Y does not satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year of Plan Y beginning in the 1994 testing year, and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fails to satisfy section 410(b) for that year. This is true even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though Plan Y satisfies section 410(b) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis in accordance with paragraph
(b)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all of the employees treated as employees of Line 2 benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Plan Y. Thus, Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employer A's highly compensated employees (50 out of 100) and 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of all of Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(100 out of 2,000). Plan Y therefore has a ratio percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent (100%
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
100%) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis and a ratio percentage of 10 percent (5%
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
50%) on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an employer-wide basis. Because Plan Y has a ratio percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, a reduced unsafe harbor percentage applies to Plan Y under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The reduced unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbor percentage applicable to Plan Y is 8.75 percent because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employer A's nonhighly compensated employee concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage is 95 percent. Plan Y's employer-wide ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of 10 percent therefore exceeds the unsafe harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage. Plan Y thus satisfies section 410(b)(5)(B) on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer-wide basis in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section for the plan year of Plan Y beginning in the 1994 testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Plan Y also satisfies section 410(b) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis in accordance with paragraph

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Employer A's total nonexcludable nonhighly compensated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees are 2,500 (rather than 2,000), of whom 100 are treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as employees of Line 2 and of whom 90 benefit under Plan Y. Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Y has a ratio percentage of 90 percent (90%
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
100%) on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, and Employer A's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhighly compensated employee concentration percentage is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2,500/2,600 or 96 percent. Thus, the reduced unsafe harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage applicable to Plan Y under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section is 8 percent. Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employer A's highly compensated employees (50 out of 100) and 3.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of all of Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(90 out of 2,500). Plan Y therefore has a ratio percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only 7.2 percent (3.6%
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
50%) on an employer-wide basis, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falls below the reduced unsafe harbor percentage of 8 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Y will be deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis if the Commissioner determines that, on
the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such employees as qualify under a classification of employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees.

substantial-service employee with respect to a line of business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a testing year if at least 75 percent of the employee's

employee's services to a line of business for the testing year

not substantial-service employees within the meaning of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) of this section with respect to any other line of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. In addition, in determining the group of top-paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, the employer may choose to disregard all employees who

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Background_Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111&hyph;3126)
requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program
to grant a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on public lands, unless the State of Alaska
enacts and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with ANILCA, and which provide for the subsistence
definition, preference, and participation specified in sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA. The State implemented
a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December
1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
McDowell
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
State of Alaska
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The court's ruling
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
McDowell
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance
with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
McDowell
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990,
responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 27114&hyph;27170). Consistent with Subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board
(Board) was established to administer the Federal Subsistence Management Program. The Board's composition includes
a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional
Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State

On July 15, 1993, the Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of a number of individuals and organizations, submitted
a petition to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they include navigable
waters within the definition of ``public lands'' as used in implementing Title VIII. This was a request for administrative
relief. The Secretaries continue their evaluation of this petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 30, 1994, the U.S. District Court for Alaska issued a decision in the consolidated

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
the United States, et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation. The court concluded that the Secretaries are entitled to manage fish and wildlife on public lands in Alaska
for the purposes of providing the subsistence priority mandated in Title VIII of ANILCA. The court further concluded
that, for the purposes of Title VIII, ``public lands'' includes all navigable waterways in Alaska. The court then
issued a stay of the decision for 60 days to allow the filing of an appeal and ordered that the stay would remain in effect,
pending an appellate decision, if one or more appeals were filed. Because the Federal government has successfully
petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal from the district court's decision, the stay
presently remains in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the petition for rulemaking is still under consideration by the Secretaries and because of the stayed court
decision relative to actual Federal jurisdiction, the Board believes that issuing regulations immediately, assuming
additional authority or revising existing regulations are not warranted and, in fact, appear to be inappropriate
at this time. However, any comments or proposals received will be carefully considered and retained for use when the
regulations are revised the next time. This interim rule effectively extends the existing regulations until December
31, 1995, or until the Secretaries direct the revision of the subsistence fish and shellfish regulations based on
a revised area of jurisdiction, or until the court directs the preparation of regulations implementing its order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board finds that public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) for this
extension are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. A lapse in regulatory control after
July 1 could seriously affect the continued viability of fish and shellfish populations, adversely impact future
subsistence opportunities for rural Alaskans, and would generally fail to serve the overall public interest. Therefore,
the Board finds that good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive the public notice and comment procedures prior
to publication of this extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also finds good cause for the existing rule to be extended until December 31, 1995, (or until they are revoked
or superseded whichever comes earlier). This December 31 date is consistent with earlier Board discussions proposing
to change the regulatory year for fisheries regulations to January 1 through December 31 to avoid having changes occur
during the middle of a fishing season. The Board therefore finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this extension
effective upon publication.

National Environmental Policy Act Compliance_A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four
alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October
7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified
through public meetings, written comments and staff analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the
four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were
included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for
an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence
Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior,
with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service,
to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative
framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) implements the Federal
Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing
regulations.

Compliance With Section 810 of ANILCA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands
a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to
conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process.
The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence
Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may
have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence
uses.

) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments
have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount
of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant
positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the
fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses
of public lands indicates that they will not be significant.

These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612.
Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of
this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings

The Commission required Tier 1 local exchange carriers (LECs) (except members of the National Exchange Carrier Association
(NECA)) to provide to interested third parties, including competitive access providers (CAPs), interexchange
carriers, (IXCs), and end users, signalling information necessary to provide tandem switching services. These
parties will thus, for the first time, be able to carry traffic of multiple IXCs from LEC end offices to their own tandems,
switch traffic at that point, and deliver the traffic to the appropriate IXC. LECs must offer signalling information
from their equal access end offices pursuant to tariff.

Summary of the Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission found that this decision represents another step in a series of efforts to remove barriers to competition
in interstate access services. It stated that while the Commission's earlier expanded interconnection decisions
opened the door to competition in special access and switched transport transmission services, interconnectors,
however, had to rely on LECs to perform the switching functions necessary to provide switched transport. The Commission
concluded that the Order will enable interconnectors, as well as other parties, to provide tandem switching functions
for switched transport services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission concluded that LEC-provision of signalling information will open the door to third parties to provide
competitive tandem switching services. By further reducing barriers to competition in switched access services,
this action will benefit all users of tandem switching, especially small IXCs that tend to rely heavily on tandem-switched
transport, who will benefit from more competitively priced tandem switching services. The Commission also found
that its action should promote more efficient use and deployment of the country's telecommunications networks,
encourage technological innovation, and exert downward pressure on access charges and long-distance rates, all
of which should contribute to economic growth and the creation of new job opportunities. In addition, these measures
should increase access to diverse facilities, which could improve network reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except NECA pool members) to provide signalling information necessary for
tandem switching from LEC equal access end offices to any interested third party (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as ``tandem switching providers'' or ``TSPs''). (Tier 1 LECs are those with $100 million or more in annual regulated
revenues for a sustained period of time.) In end offices in which common channel signalling (CCS or SS7) is available,
TSPs shall have the option of receiving signalling information via SS7 or multi-frequency (MF) signalling. The provision
of this information will be treated as a new service under the Commission's price caps regime. Tier 1 LECs must file
tariff amendments to reflect the availability of signalling information from LEC equal access end offices within
ninety days of the publication of the Order in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. Based on the record and in light of prior decisions on pricing flexibility in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transport
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proceeding, the Commission did not grant LECs additional pricing flexibility at this time. The Commission also found
that the transport interconnection charge is sufficient to protect support flows potentially affected by the provision
of signalling information.

4. The Commission stated that it has taken several initiatives to increase competition in the long-distance market.
First, in 1992, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Access Expanded Interconnection Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission required Tier 1 LECs, except NECA pool members, to provide expanded interconnection for interstate
special access to all interested parties.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also stated that in 1993, it adopted the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in which the Commission required LECs providing expanded interconnection for special access to provide expanded
interconnection for switched transport service as well.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In that order, the Commission opened the opportunity for interconnectors to provide alternative transmission services
to LEC-provided direct-trunked transport and entrance facilities by collocating transmission facilities in LEC
end offices, tandems, serving wire centers (SWCs), and certain remote nodes. The Commission stated that as a result
of those two actions, interconnectors are now able to provide special access and switched transport transmission
services in competition with the LECs.

5. The Commission stated that only LECs, however, currently can provide tandem switching functions. Third parties
cannot now provide such functions because they generally do not have access to the signalling information necessary
to switch and route traffic to IXCs. Thus, virtually all tandem-switched transport currently must be routed through
LEC tandems and switched by the LECs at that point; interconnectors can provide only the link between the LEC tandem
and the IXC point-of-presence (POP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Commission stated that in a Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 which is the subject of this proceeding, it proposed to broaden the scope of its access initiatives to address this
limitation. Specifically, the Commission proposed to require LECs to provide other parties to offer tandem switching
functions. Under this proposal, interconnectors would be able to offer tandem-switched transport, using their
own tandems, in competition with the LECs. In addition, third parties, such as IXCs, could obtain economies by aggregating
their traffic from end offices on a single direct trunk, routing that traffic to a third-party tandem, and switching
it at that point.

7. The Commission stated that the record identifies four types of signalling information used to provide switched
transport: (1) The Carrier Identification Code (CIC), which identifies the caller's selected IXC; (2) the OZZ, which
indicates the specific IXC trunk group that is to carry the call; (3) the Automatic Number Identification (ANI), which
identifies the billed number; and (4) the Called Number Identification (CNI), which identifies the called telephone
number. IXCs may use different trunk groups to carry different classes of calls. For example, 0+ calls may be carried
on a different trunk group than direct-dialed domestic calls. The OZZ digits indicate the call type, and thus the trunk
group, onto which a particular call should be routed.

Requirement to Provide Signalling Information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. The Commission stated that currently, LECs transmit ANI and CNI to their access customers on originating Feature
Group D trunks from LEC end offices and tandems. They do not, however, transmit the CIC and OZZ codes to third parties
because IXCs do not need this information to route and bill calls. Thus, these latter codes are dropped by the LECs from
the signalling data stream after trunk selection has taken place. In the case of direct-trunked traffic, the CIC and
OZZ codes are dropped at the originating end office; in the case of tandem-switched traffic, they are dropped at the
tandem. Because the CIC and OZZ codes are needed for tandem switching and are not currently provided to third parties,
these data are the focus of this proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The Commission affirmed its tentative conclusion that broader interconnection requirements to facilitate access
competition are in the public interest. In accordance with this finding, the Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except
NECA pool members) to provide signalling information from equal access end offices so that third parties may install
their own tandems to provide tandem-switching services. Third parties may collocate at LEC end offices and provide
their own tandem-switched transport between those end offices and their tandems, or they may purchase LEC transport
to their tandems. We do not require LECs to provide signalling information for tandem-switching from their tandems
since we find that the record does not support the establishment of such a requirement at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Commission concluded that the availability to third parties of signalling information needed for tandem
switching could provide significant public benefits. It would facilitate broader access competition by enabling
interconnectors to offer competitive interstate tandem-switching and transport services. In addition, it would
increase opportunities for small IXCs to gain economies of scale by sharing direct-routed transport facilities
and providing their own tandem-switching. The Commission found that as it stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 broader access competition should exert downward pressure on tandem-switched transport rates, while fostering
more efficient provisioning of these services by new competitors and LECs. The Commission also concluded that in
addition, competition should encourage innovation and investment in new technologies and could offer increased
network reliability through route diversity and redundancy. IXCs would benefit from greater competition in the
tandem-switched service market. Small IXCs would especially benefit because they tend to rely more heavily on tandem-switched
transport than larger IXCs. The Commission also stated that in addition, by promoting competition in tandem-switched
transport services and facilitating the use of direct-trunked transport by small IXCs, these measures should help
ensure more rational cost-based pricing relationships between direct-trunked and tandem-switching transport
services, thereby lessening the need for regulatory controls and fostering more efficient use of these services.
All of these benefits should contribute to economic growth_by enabling IXCs to use more efficient transport arrangements,
by fostering better, more reliable, and more rationally priced access services, as well as by creating new market
opportunities for interconnectors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Commission also concluded that LECs can make signalling information available from their end offices at very
little cost. Indeed, the record indicates that the costs to LECs of providing such information from end offices may
well be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 involving only a simple change in the end office routing table. The Commission stated that while a few LECs baldly assert
that the costs of providing signalling could be significant, these LECs do not substantiate their allegations with
cost estimates or data. Nor do they distinguish between end-office generated and tandem-generated signalling information.
The Commission found that moreover, no party has shown that the necessary modifications to LEC billing systems would
be unreasonably costly or burdensome, or that the asserted need to change industry standards to accommodate the passage
of CIC and OZZ codes over Feature Group D represents a significant barrier to the implementation of this proposal.
The Commission concluded that any such measures could be accomplished without undue burden or cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Commission stated that it was not persuaded that competitive tandem switching services would require assignment
of CICs to IXCs. The record fails to indicate that any entity would actually seek to offer or use that kind of routing
dynamic. Even without additional CIC assignments, IXCs would be able to designate a primary route and an overflow
route for their traffic, thereby securing the benefits of both route and carrier diversity. Moreover, IXCs could
vary routing between a LEC and third party tandem on an end-office-by-end-office basis or, perhaps, based on OZZ codes_thereby
designating one as primary for a particular type of traffic and another for a different type of traffic. No IXC indicates
that these options are insufficient, at least for now. Therefore, the Commission found, no additional CIC code assignments
would have to be made to accommodate competitive tandem-switched networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Commission also found that the record belies any contention that third parties do not really want signalling
information and that IXCs do not really want to use competitively-provided tandem-switching services. The Commission
found that the vast majority of parties, including IXCs, CAPs, users, and some LECs, argue that unbundled signalling
information would allow development of alternatives to LEC tandem-switched transport services and they urge us
to make such information available. The Commission stated that even if the measures that it now takes do not produce
an immediate change in the access market, they will be beneficial in the long-term. By eliminating barriers to competition
in the provision of tandem-switched services, this action will pave the way to a more competitive access market in
the future. The Commission also stated that the availability of signalling information to third parties could, in
itself and even without actual entry into the market by competitive tandem-switching providers, subject LEC pricing
to some additional competitive pressures. Since the costs of providing signalling information from equal access
end offices are so small, the Commission concluded, these benefits are well worth the costs. The Commission also stated
that LECs should be required to offer signalling information from equal access end offices is not based on application
of the test that governs LEC BSE offerings since signalling information is not a BSE, but that, nevertheless, its conclusion
was based on the same type of cost/benefit considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. The Commission stated that it appears that providing signalling information from LEC tandems would require software
upgrades to those tandems. In addition, the record indicates that tandem-provided signalling may be of less utility
to TSPs than end office-provided signalling. Although some parties claim generally that tandem-provided signalling
could provide a useful adjunct to other forms of interconnection, they do not explain with any specificity how they
could use such an architecture, or how a two-tandem architecture could actually be competitively viable, either
from a service quality or pricing standpoint. Therefore, based on the current record, the Commission did not require
LECs to provide this service at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The Commission clarified that in proposing access to LEC signalling information from LEC end offices and tandems,
it did not intend to require LECs to reconfigure their SS7 networks. Thus, the Commission held that LECs may provide
end-office-generated signalling information through STPs, and they may require TSPs that are terminating traffic
to transmit signalling formation to LEC end offices through LEC STPs. The Commission recognized that STPs perform
important network screening functions and did not require LECs to decentralize those functions by deploying them
in every switch. Moreover, the record does not indicate that TSPs would seek to interconnect via SS7 at end offices,
rather than at STPs. Rather, as some parties pointed out, it would be far more efficient for them to interconnect at
STPs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Regarding billing of terminating traffic, the Commission stated that, consistent with its earlier expanded
interconnection measures, the customer of record of the terminating LEC should be billed by the terminating LEC for
services provided by that LEC. If the TSP is the customer of record, the LEC should bill the TSP directly. If the TSP's
customer is the customer of record, then the TSP must provide the LEC with billing tapes so that the LEC may properly
count and bill access minutes. The Commission rejected the suggestion of some LECs that all discrepancies between
TSP-provided billing tapes and LEC billing records be resolved in favor of the LECs. The Commission stated that TSPs
and LECs can and should establish fair and reasonable procedures to resolve billing discrepancies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The Commission stated that it does not base its decision that LECs must, in some instances, accept billing tapes
from TSPs on a co-carrier model. It required LECs to make signalling information available to any third party, not
just providers of competitive tandem-switched transport services. Thus, small IXCs may use signalling information
as a way to aggregate their traffic on direct-trunked transport facilities purchased from a LEC so that they can enjoy
the same scale economies as larger IXCs. In that situation, the IXC ordering the signalling and transport would be
a reseller or aggregator, not a co-carrier. Indeed, if the meet-point billing model applied, TSPs would not be able
to purchase direct-trunked transport from a LEC, since LEC tandem-switched transport rates to the ``meet-point''
would apply.

Collocation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. The Commission affirmed its tentative conclusion that physical collocation of switching equipment should not
be required. Virtually every commenter that addressed this issue supported the tentative conclusion and the reasoning
behind it. Thus, the parties agreed that there is no competitive or technical benefit to locating switching equipment
in LEC offices; that switching equipment is too large and too heavy to be collocated in LEC space; and that interconnectors
would prefer to place their switching equipment on their own premises for monitoring purposes. The Commission found
that the arguments offered in support of mandatory collocation were not convincing. It stated that no one has shown
why the line-drawing process between switching and transmission equipment would be unmanageable or that collocation
is necessary to ensure fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of interconnectors by LECs. The Commission's tariffing
and general nondiscrimination requirements should provide sufficient protection against unfair or unreasonably
discriminatory LEC rates and practices.

Pricing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. The Commission concluded that LEC provision of CIC and OZZ data to TSPs from LEC end offices will constitute a new
service under the price caps regime, which covers all Tier 1 LECs. New services add to the range of options already available
to customers. While LECs currently transmit CIC and OZZ codes to their own access tandems, they do not provide this
information to their customers. Therefore, these data add to the range of options of LEC customers and hence represent
a new service. While LECs appear to be able to provide this new service without implementing new technology, the need_or
absence of need_for new technology does not dictate the categorization of the service under price caps. Rather, this
factor affects the costs and thus the price that LECs may charge for a new service.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. LECs will be required to make a cost-based showing under the price caps new services test. This showing will enable
the Commission to ensure that signalling services are reasonably priced. The Commission will not use the net revenue
test in reviewing LEC tariff filings. The Commission stated that this is consistent with its decision to eliminate
the net revenue test for new service offerings under price caps. That test is unnecessary, both because of the Commission's
requirement that LECs submit cost support for new services, and because LECs clearly lack incentives to underprice
signalling services provided to competitive tandem-switching providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The Commission concluded further that LECs must establish new rate elements for CIC and OZZ signalling data as
a separate service category within the trunking basket. This category will be subject to an upper pricing band of 2%.
The Commission stated that because LECs have no incentive to price signalling services at predatory levels, it saw
no need for a lower band and therefore did not impose one. The Commission believes that these measures are necessary
to prevent LECs from offsetting increases in the price of signalling information provided to TSPs with price reductions
in the LECs' own tandem-switched transport rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The Commission found that the co-carrier model does not aptly define the LEC/TSP relationship. It found that even
though the Commission has stated in the past that cellular service providers are like co-carriers, it has never held
that cellular interconnection charges should be imposed on all LEC customers or on all cellular users, rather than
on the providers taking interconnection. Thus, a co-carrier model does not necessarily dictate that the costs unique
to providing a joint service should always be directly imposed on the LEC's customers or on all customers of the service
in question. The Commission also stated that a cost recovery mechanism that would have all purchasers of switched
transport or tandem-switched transport bear the costs of making signalling information available to TSPs, is inappropriate
and that instead, TSPs should pay for such costs. The Commission found that this is consistent with its long-held view
that costs should be paid by the cost causer.

Recovery of Support Flows
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. The Commission stated that it appears from the record that there is no need for additional support mechanisms in
conjunction with adoption of this Order. The transport interconnection charge is sufficient to protect support
flows potentially affected by this decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

ONA Framework
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24. The Commission concluded that unbundled CIC and OZZ data are not BSEs as defined in its ONA orders and that there
is no public policy reason to treat them equivalently. BSEs are ``optional unbundled features .&blank;.&blank;.
that an ESP may require or find useful in configuring an enhanced service.''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission found that there has been no showing that the CIC and OZZ data that are the subject of the Order will be
used by ESPs to provide enhanced services. Rather, these data will be used by TSPs to provide basic network services.
Thus, these data do not fall within the Commission's definition of a BSE.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. The Commission also found that no party demonstrated that it would be in the public interest to treat CIC and OZZ
codes as BSEs. The Commission stated that while some parties argued that the four-part test that LECs use in determining
whether to offer an ESP-requested BSE should apply, it has relied on similar considerations in assessing the relative
costs and benefits of LEC-provided signalling information. The Commission also stated that the ``flagging'' requirements
associated with BSEs, under which BOCs must identify BSEs that they intend to use themselves, are irrelevant: There
is no dispute that LECs use CIC and OZZ data for tandem-switched transport service. The Commission also found that
there would be no added benefit from a pricing standpoint in treating CIC and OZZ data as BSEs, since it has already held
that the new services test applies to their initial rates.

Tariffing and Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. The Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except NECA members) to file tariffs, with requisite cost support, for the
provision of CIC and OZZ codes within ninety days from publication of this Order in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to be effective on forty-five days' notice. The Commission found that the record in this proceeding shows that LECs
can provide CIC and OZZ codes to third parties from equal access end offices simply by modifying their end office routing
tables, without purchasing new end office software and without making other costly and time-consuming modifications.
The Commission concluded that under the circumstances, there is no reason why the LECs cannot tariff this offering
for all of their equal access end offices within ninety days of publication of this Order in the

LEC Pricing Flexibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. The Commission did not grant LECs additional pricing flexibility but stated that it will continue to examine these
issues in a broader context in future consideration of pending access reform petitions. The Commission also stated
that it has already addressed virtually all of the specific proposals suggested by LECs in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Transport Reconsideration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, LECs may offer density zone pricing and volume and term discounts under certain conditions. In addition, they
may price transport between their tandems and SWCs on a flat-rate basis. The Commission also stated that it had considered
and rejected in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 various other requests for flexibility. For example, the Commission rejected the suggestion that LECs receive the
same pricing flexibility as their competitors, noting that giving LECs too much flexibility could stifle competitive
entry and harm customers of less competitive services. The Commission also declined to eliminate service category
pricing bands, stating that these bands serve important public policy goals. The Commission found that no party had
shown that providing signalling information to TSPs warrants a different outcome. Nor had any party set forth any
other specific pricing flexibility request related to providing signalling information. The Commission also found
that no party had demonstrated that the availability of signalling information warrants authorization of LEC contract
tariffs. The Commission has limited contract carriage to services found to be ``substantially competitive.'' The
Commission concluded that while the measures it now takes should permit alternatives to LEC tandem-switched access
services to develop, it could not conclude that these services are now subject to substantial competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The Commission concluded that for these reasons, it would not to grant LECs additional pricing flexibility in
conjunction with its decision to make tandem signalling information available. The Commission stated, however,
that this decision is not intended to prejudge broader questions regarding the possible need for access charge reform.
The Commission stated that by opening the door to greater competition in the provision of tandem-switched services,
it is continuing the process of removing barriers to the development of a more competitive access market in which CAPs
and other entities can participate.

29. The Commission declined to impose reciprocal signalling obligations on interconnectors at this time. It found,
first, that requests for reciprocal obligations are beyond the scope of this proceeding. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proposed that LECs provide signalling information to third parties. The Commission stated that it did not propose
to impose reciprocal requirements on these third parties, and that it declined to broaden this proceeding to consider
such requirements here. The Commission stated that second, LEC requests for reciprocity seem to assume that only
CAPs will purchase signalling information. As noted, this information must be made available to any interested party,
including IXCs. LECs requesting reciprocity fail to address the implications of their proposal with respect to these
other types of TSPs. The Commission stated that third, except in the few instances where CAPs have end offices, interconnectors
simply do not have the signalling information to provide to the LECs, and the LECs have not demonstrated specific,
present needs for such information. The Commission found furthermore, that TSPs do not possess market power. It stated,
for example, that the Commission had previously declined to impose reciprocal obligations on interconnectors,
noting, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that CAPs and other interconnectors do not control bottleneck facilities.

30. The Commission found that most parties agree that the customer of record should be responsible for reporting the
PIU factor for terminating traffic when the LEC cannot itself measure jurisdiction. The Commission stated that this
is consistent with existing reporting arrangements that have worked satisfactorily. If the customer of record is
a TSP, it shall be the responsibility of that TSP to compile PIU reports based on data from those to whom it provides tandem-switching.
If the customer of record is an IXC or other purchaser of access, that entity shall continue to provide PIU reports directly
to the LEC providing terminating access.

31. The Commission concluded that the signalling information requirement does not raise separations issues that
should be referred to a Joint Board. The record does not show that providing signalling information will raise any
significant issues beyond those already referred to the Joint Board in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the costs associated with LEC provision of CIC and OZZ codes from equal access end offices should be minimal.
The Commission found that therefore, these costs or the revenues derived from providing signalling information
do not require Joint Board consideration. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
stated that the Commission did not intend to refer to the Joint Board broader separations issues. The Commission stated
that these matters would be more properly addressed in the context of a comprehensive separations review proceeding.

32. The Commission concluded that in this Order, it took another step in its ongoing effort to promote competition
in the interstate access market. Tier 1 LECs (except NECA members) are required to provide signalling information
from equal access end offices to interested third parties. This measure will allow third parties to provide tandem
switching and thereby promote development of alternatives to LEC-provided tandem-switched transport service.
CAPs may develop their own tandem-switching networks; other TSPs may use tandem-switching to achieve scale economics
attending the aggregation of traffic. The Commission found that by promoting access to diverse facilities and providers,
this action should permit more efficient use and deployment of interstate access services, increase network reliability
and redundancy, encourage innovation, and exert downward pressure on access charges and long-distance rates. These
benefits should, in turn, contribute to economic growth and the creation of new job opportunities.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In July 1992, RSPA published a final rule establishing a national registration and fee assessment program for persons
offering for transportation or transporting certain categories and quantities of hazardous materials in intrastate,
interstate, and foreign commerce. The fees collected under the registration program are to fund a grant program to
enhance State, Indian tribal, and local hazardous materials emergency preparedness and response activities. This
final rule adopts certain changes to the current registration program effective July 1, 1994, the beginning of the
next registration year. The changes delay the requirement for foreign offerors to register and require a merchant
vessel carrier to maintain the Certificate of Registration on board each vessel carrying hazardous materials subject
to the registration requirements or to annotate its registration number on any document readily available to enforcement
personnel.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 9, 1992, RSPA published a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;208 (57 FR 30620), establishing a national registration
program, as mandated by Congress in the 1990 amendments to the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49
App. U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for persons engaged in the offering for transportation or transportation of certain categories and quantities
of hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce. Persons currently subject to the registration
program are required to annually file a registration statement with RSPA and pay an annual fee of $250 to fund a nationwide
emergency response training and planning grant program for States, local governments, and Indian tribes, and a $50
administrative fee to offset DOT processing costs. The fee of $250 is the minimum amount permitted to be collected
for purposes of funding the emergency response preparedness and planning grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the authority of the HMTA, RSPA has developed and implemented a reimbursable emergency preparedness grant
program. The regulations establishing this program were issued in a final rule entitled ``Public Sector Training
and Planning Grants'' under Docket HM&hyph;209 on September 17, 1992 (57 FR 43062). The purpose of the grant program
is to provide funds, technical assistance, and support to States, Indian tribes, and political subdivisions to develop,
implement, and improve planning and training programs for emergency responders in the public sector. The funding
for the grant program comes from the fees received from RSPA's registration program. Approximately 26,000 persons
have registered with RSPA for the current registration year, substantially fewer in number than originally anticipated.
RSPA is concerned that many persons who are required to register have not. Therefore, on April 1, 1994, RSPA proposed
two compliance-related requirements in the NPRM to enhance nationwide compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA proposed that each person who offers or transports a hazardous material for which registration is required may
do so only if both the transporter and the offeror (if required) are registered. They would be required, on an annual
basis, to obtain each other's registration number or a copy of each other's current Certificate of Registration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, RSPA decided to further enhance the enforcement of the registration program as it applies to foreign or
domestic merchant vessel carriers. Accordingly, RSPA proposed to require that each merchant vessel carrier carry
a copy of its current Certificate of Registration issued by RSPA or another document bearing the registration number
identified as the ``U.S. DOT Hazmat Reg. No.'' on board each merchant vessel carrying a hazardous material subject
to the registration requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the NPRM, legislation is being considered which would grant DOT the discretionary authority to waive
the registration or fee requirement for any person domiciled outside the United States, if that person's country
does not impose registration or fee requirements on U.S. persons offering hazardous materials to that country (see,
for example, HR 2178 which passed on November 21, 1993). Pending the outcome of these legislative initiatives, RSPA
proposed to further extend the delay in application of the registration program to foreign offerors from July 1, 1994
until July 1, 1996.

Delay in Registering Foreign Offerors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters overwhelmingly supported RSPA's proposed two-year delay in requiring registration of foreign offerors.
Many commenters recommended that RSPA not implement foreign offeror registration at all because of the possibility
of reciprocal action taken against the United States. A Canadian chemical manufacturers' association noted that
shipments to Canada are exempt from Canadian registration requirements and strongly recommended that Canadian
offerors be afforded reciprocal treatment when shipping to the U.S. Therefore, RSPA is extending, as proposed, the
exemption for foreign offerors from registration and fee requirements until July 1, 1996.

Verification of Registration on Board Vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters questioned the need for the proposed requirement for vessel carriers to have a copy of a valid registration
certificate or other document displaying a valid registration number on board each vessel. The International Chamber
of Shipping stated that the proposed requirement would add to the paperwork burden on the ship and increase the workload
of the ship's command. This commenter further noted that RSPA already has access to a ship's registration numbers
at the operator's office or at the office of the operator's agent. The Steamship Operators Intermodal Committee claimed
the total population of vessel owners, operators, and their agents is relatively small and readily identifiable.
The U.S. Atlantic and Gulf/Australia New Zealand Conference added that vessels do not present the problems of vast
numbers and mobility presented by motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of this requirement could avert potentially significant and costly delays for vessels entering and clearing
U.S. port areas. The marginal cost associated with requiring a transporter's registration number on board a vessel
is clearly outweighed by more significant costs resulting from time-consuming inspections by Coast Guard personnel.
A readily available copy of the certificate of registration or other document indicating a valid registration number
would eliminate any need for communication between the master of the vessel and the vessel owner/lessor (who could
be domiciled in a foreign country) and subsequent inquiries to an agent representing the vessel. Therefore, RSPA
is adopting the proposed requirement for a merchant vessel carrier to maintain the Certificate of Registration or
another document indicating the valid registration number on board each vessel carrying hazardous material subject
to the registration requirements readily available to enforcement personnel. However, because of the brief time
period between publication of this final rule and its effective date, RSPA is providing a delay until January 1, 1995,
to comply with this requirement.

Other Issues Addressed By Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters opposed RSPA's proposal that offerors and transporters check each other's registration status.
Responsibility for enforcing registration requirements, logistical problems, administrative burdens, and increased
costs were the predominant reasons offered by commenters opposing this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters overwhelmingly believed that federal and state agencies should be responsible for enforcing the regulations,
not industry. A related concern expressed by commenters is that a person otherwise in compliance with the regulations
could be in violation of the registration requirements by unknowingly doing business with a customer who falsely
claimed to be registered. Furthermore, commenters feared that persons who are in compliance with the registration
requirements and refuse to do business with unregistered customers may lose their customers and revenue to less scrupulous
competitors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative burdens were identified as the creation of new databases, maintenance of additional files, and preparation
of correspondence. Increased costs would involve additional function-specific training of personnel to determine
if a shipment is subject to registration, higher clerical expenses for correspondence and recordkeeping, and delays
or cancellations caused by a last-minute exchange of registration information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to many commenters, a ``logistical nightmare'' would result from this proposed requirement, especially
when intermodal transportation is involved. Other complicated situations cited by commenters involve selection
of a transporter by a customer, customer-provided transport vehicles, interlining carriers, and infrequent or
irregular shipments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, numerous commenters requested a delay in the effective date of this requirement, if adopted, beyond the
beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 registration year on July 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA believes that more time is needed to explore thoroughly the issues and concerns raised by commenters to this proposal;
therefore, the proposal to require verification of registration by a transporter or offeror is not adopted in this
final rule. RSPA anticipates providing a more detailed evaluation of comments and alternatives to this proposed
requirement, clarifying various provisions of the registration program and responding to other miscellaneous
suggestions provided by commenters in a rulemaking action in the near future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and
therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered a significant rule under
the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). A regulatory evaluation
is available for review in the Docket.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for three plants: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cyanea grimesiana 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Gouania vitifolia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(NCN). These taxa are known primarily from the Waianae Mountain Range, located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The three
plant taxa and their habitats have been adversely threatened to varying degrees by one or more of the following_habitat
degradation and competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized, alien vegetation; and habitat
degradation and potential predation by feral animals. Because of the low number of extant individuals and severely
restricted distributions, populations of these taxa are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction and/or
reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection and recovery
provisions provided by the Act.

Gouania vitifolia

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The island of Oahu is formed from the remnants of two large shield volcanoes, the older Waianae Volcano on the west and
the younger Koolau Volcano on the east. Because of the loss of their original shield volcano shape as the result of extensive
erosion, today these volcanoes are called ``mountains'' or ``ranges,'' and consist of long, narrow ridges. The Waianae
Mountains were built by eruptions that took place primarily along three rift zones. The two principal rift zones run
in a northwestward and south-southeastward direction from the summit, and a lesser one runs to the northeast. The
range is approximately 40 miles (mi) (64 kilometers (km)) long. The caldera lies between the north side of Makaha Valley
and the head of Nanakuli Valley (Macdonald

1983). The Waianae Mountains are in the rain shadow of the parallel Koolau Mountains. Except for Mt. Kaala, the highest
point on Oahu (4,020 feet (ft)) (1,225 meters(m)), the Waianaes receive much less rainfall (Wagner

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). The median annual rainfall for the Waianae Mountains varies from 20 to 75 inches (in.) (50 to 190 centimeters
(cm)), with only the small summit area of Mt. Kaala receiving the highest amount.

, a member of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), is a shrub, usually unbranched, growing from 3.3 to 10.5 ft (1
to 3.2 m) tall. Its leaves are 10.5 to 23 in. (27 to 58 cm) long by 5.5 to 12.5 in. (14 to 32 cm) wide and are deeply cut into
9 to 12 lobes per side. The plant usually has small prickles on its stem and leaves. Clusters of 6 to 12 stalked flowers
arise from the leaf axils. Sepals are fused to the ovary forming a cup 0.3 to 0.6 in. (0.7 to 1.6 cm) long with small, narrow,
triangular lobes at the tips. The petals are purplish or greenish to yellow-white, often washed or striped with magenta,
and are about 2 to 3 in. (5.5 to 8 cm) long and 0.2 to 0.4 in. (0.5 to 1 cm) wide. Fruits are elliptical orange berries, 0.7
to 1.2 in. (1.8 to 3 cm) long. This subspecies can be distinguished from the other two subspecies by its short, narrow,
calyx lobes which are not fused or overlapping (Lammers 1990, St. John 1978).

1992a6, Lammers 1990), a distance of about 4 mi (6.5 km). This taxon is known to be extant in Kaluaa Gulch, but may also
still exist in Ekahanui and North Palawai Gulches. All populations are on privately owned land (HHP 1992a2, 1992a4,
1992a6; Joel Lau, The Nature Conservancy, Steve Perlman, National Tropical Botanical Garden, and Loyal Mehrhoff,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comms., 1993). Five plants are known from the Kaluaa population and as many as
13 plants may be found in the other 2 populations (J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992, 1993), though these populations have
not been seen in the last 10 years.

, in the fern family Polypodiaceae, grows from a slender, erect rhizome (underground stem), 0.2 to 1.2 in. (0.5 to 3
cm) tall and 0.2 to 0.4 in. (0.5 to 1 cm) in diameter, which is covered with the bases of the leaf stalks and a few small black
scales. Stalks of the fronds are black and shiny, and about 0.8 to 2 in. (2 to 5 cm) long. The fronds are linear, 3 to 12 in.
(8 to 30 cm) tall by 0.2 to 1.2 in. (0.5 to 3 cm) broad, with 20 to 35 pinnae (leaflets) per side, and gradually narrowing
towards the apex. The pinnae are usually strongly asymmetrical in outline, unequally triangular, with mostly entire
(smooth) margins. There usually is a single marginal sorus (the spore-producing body) running along the upper margin
of the underside of the pinna. This species is distinguished from others in the genus by a rhizome completely covered
by the persisting bases of the leaf stalks, and few, very small scales, by sori mostly confined to the upper pinnae margins,
and by delicate fronds gradually and symmetrically narrowing toward the apex (Wagner 1951, 1952).

Gulch, Palawai Gulch, and the Pualii-Napepeiauolelo Ridge (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). The three known populations,
which are on Lualualei Naval Reservation and on privately owned land, are scattered over a distance of about 2 mi (3

, a member of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), is a climbing shrub or woody vine with tendrils. Leaves are papery
in texture with a moderate to dense covering of short, soft hairs on both surfaces. The leaves are elliptic to broadly
oval in outline with toothed or lobed margins and 1.2 to 3.2 in. (3 to 8 cm) long by 0.8 to 1.9 in. (2 to 4.8 cm) wide. Flowers
are arranged in axillary spikes 0.3 to 2.8 in. (0.8 to 7 cm) long. The flowers are small with sepals and petals ranging
from 0.03 to 0.04 in. (0.7 to 1.1 mm) in length. Both the sepals and petals are white. The 2- or 3-winged fruit are about
0.4 in. (9 to 10 mm) long. Seeds are oval, glossy, dark brown, and about 0.1 to 0.2 in. (3.4 to 5 mm) long. This species is

land (Anon. 1991, HHP 1992c5). The five plants are close to one another, growing in a single patch in a forest of mostly
naturalized, non-native taxa (HHP 1992c5), and may represent clones of a single individual (Joel Lau, HHP, pers.
comm., 1992). A second, smaller patch was discovered near the first, and probably represents a second clone. Information

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months
of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13,
1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned
listing of these species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section
4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding
requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October
of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final 1-year

In the December 14, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. The public comment
period ended on January 28, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific
organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting
public comment was published in the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on December 26, 1993. Two letters of comment were received_one
from a conservation organization and the other from a concerned citizen_supporting the listing of these taxa from
the Waianae Mountains, island of Oahu, but raising no specific issues.

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The habitats of the plants included in this final rule have undergone extreme alteration because of past and present
land management practices, including deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, agricultural development,
and military use (Frierson 1973, Wagner

threats to the three taxa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Schinus terebinthifolius
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Christmas berry), an aggressive tree introduced to Hawaii before 1911 as an ornamental, has had particularly detrimental
impacts (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This fast-growing alien plant is able to form dense thickets, displacing other
plants, and also may release a chemical that inhibits the growth of other species (Smith 1985). As early as the 1940s,
Christmas berry had invaded the dry slopes of Oahu and it is now replacing the native vegetation of much of the southern
Waianae Mountains (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Christmas berry is gradually invading other areas of the Waianae Mountains
as well, and now threatens to occupy the habitat of the three endangered plant taxa (HHP 1992a2, 1992b2 to 1992b4, 1992c5).

1970 and is now widespread throughout Honouliuli (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988). This species forms a dense
understory, shading other plants and hindering plant regeneration. At present, Koster's curse is the major threat

 (molasses grass), another aggressive alien plant species. Molasses grass ranges from the dry lowlands to the lower
wet forests, especially in open areas with sparse vegetation. This fire-adapted grass produces a dense mat capable
of smothering plants, provides fuel for fires, and carries fires into areas with native woody plants (Cuddihy and
Stone 1990). One population of

Feral pigs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sus scrofa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been in the Waianae Mountains for about 150 years and are known to be one of the major current modifiers of forest
habitats (Stone 1985). Pigs damage the native vegetation by rooting and trampling the forest floor and encourage
the expansion of alien plants that are better able to exploit the newly tilled soils than are native taxa (Stone 1985).
Pigs also disseminate alien plant taxa through their feces and on their bodies, accelerating the spread of alien plant
taxa within the native forest. Present throughout the Waianae Mountains in low numbers, feral pigs pose a potential
threat as some pig trails and rooting have been seen in the general areas of all three plant taxa included in this rule.
The rooting was localized and no direct damage to any of the three plant taxa was noted. However, this situation could
change very quickly (HHP 1992a2, 1992b2, 1992b3, 1992c5).

 is known only from private lands. Federal listing automatically results in listing under Hawaii State law, which
prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies. State regulations
prohibit the removal, destruction, or damage of plants found on State lands. However, the regulations are difficult
to enforce because of limited personnel. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS, Sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)) states, ``Any
species of aquatic life, wildlife, or wild plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the
[Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter
*&blank;*&blank;*'' Further, the State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage
any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect.
195D&hyph;5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative
Agreements). Listing of these three plant taxa, therefore, reinforces and supplements the protection available
to the taxa under State law. The Federal Act also offers additional protection to these three taxa because it is a violation
of the Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction
in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The small number of populations and individuals of all of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from stochastic
events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental
disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. All three
taxa in this rule are known from three or fewer populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining to issue this final rule. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list these three plant taxa as endangered. These taxa are known from fewer than five populations.
The three taxa are threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and competition from alien plants;
habitat degradation and potential predation by feral animals, particularly pigs; and lack of legal protection or
difficulty in enforcing laws which are already in effect. Small population size and limited distribution make these
taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because
these three taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition
of endangered as defined in the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these taxa. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical
habitat in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and local newspapers as required in a proposal for critical habitat would increase the degree of threat to these plants
from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline and increase enforcement problems. The
listing of these taxa as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plants and thus can make these plants attractive to
researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have
been notified of the importance of protecting the habitat of these taxa. Protection of the habitat of the taxa will
be addressed through the recovery process. Although one of these taxa is located on a federally owned military reservation,
it is on steep slopes near the reservation boundaries where it is unlikely to be impacted by Federal activities. Therefore,
the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these taxa is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of these taxa.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private
organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and
requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies
and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires
Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species or to destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. One of these plant taxa.

 is located on the Lualualei Naval Reservation under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Defense. However,
because the plant is located on steep slopes near the reservation boundaries, it is unlikely to be impacted by Federal
activities. There are no other known Federal activities that occur within the present known habitat of these three
plant taxa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the three endangered plant taxa, all prohibitions
of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal
with respect to any endangered plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export;
transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate
or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from an area under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously
damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy
any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation
of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities
involving endangered plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits would
ever be sought or issued because the plants are not common in cultivation nor in the wild.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule at the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) to prohibit all taking of live rock in the
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; to prohibit the taking of live rock by chipping in the EEZ from the Dade/Broward
County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and to limit the harvest of live rock from the EEZ off
the southern Atlantic states in 1994 to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf of Mexico are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by
the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South
Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act (Magnuson Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including
dead coral or rock (excluding mollusk shells), and therefore is a ``fish'' within the meaning of the Magnuson Act.
Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef
aquaria. Live rock is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonrenewable resource providing essential fishery habitat in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), NMFS published an emergency interim rule to control the taking of live rock in the Gulf
of Mexico. A description of the fishery and the rationale for that rulemaking are contained in that rule and are not
repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part because of concerns about effort shifting from recently closed areas in the Gulf of Mexico to current or new
harvest areas off the southern Atlantic states, the South Atlantic Council requested an emergency rule to: (1) Prohibit
the taking of live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; (2) prohibit chipping of live rock in the EEZ from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dade/Broward County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and (3) limit the harvest of live rock
in 1994 from the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reported landings from the Florida portion of the proposed closed area totaled less than 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) in 1993
or about 1 percent of all Florida landings. Florida is the only state in which live rock landings have been recorded.
This emergency closure is designed in part to prevent expansion of harvesting effort into new areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into smaller fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer.
Chipping causes serious damage to hard bottom habitats including coral reefs in the Florida Keys. Recent public testimony
to the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils indicated that chipping accounts for about 10 to 20 percent of the live rock
harvest off the southern Atlantic states. In the Gulf of Mexico, chipping of limestone ledges and worm reefs accounts
for about 90 percent of the live rock harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a proposed phase out of live rock harvesting under Amendment 2 to the FMP, which is currently under development,
the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils intend to limit harvest to loose rubble rock that is primarily the result of natural
erosion processes. About 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) of rubble live rock were reported landed in Florida in 1992, and this
is the basis for the 1994 quota. Data available to the South Atlantic Council indicate that live rock landings are increasing
and the quota for 1994 is likely to be exceeded prior to implementation of management measures in Amendment 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) estimates that the quota will probably be met sometime
in October 1994. If a shift of harvesting effort from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic occurs due to the Gulf emergency
rule or other factors, the quota could be reached much earlier. Amendment 2 is not expected to be implemented until
mid November 1994. The South Atlantic Council therefore requested emergency action to implement the 1994 quota and
to prohibit all chipping of live rock to prevent damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery habitat
in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, including the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the Florida DEP, the closure of the EEZ north of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida's Dade/Broward County line to live rock collecting may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect approximately 12 individuals who reported live rock landings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1993; however, the ex-vessel value of these landings was only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about $800 per Florida Saltwater Products License (SPL). In Dade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Monroe Counties, Florida, live rock landings in 1993 were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported by 96 SPL holders. These fishermen will be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confine their harvest to loose rubble rock, which may have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marginal effect on the total value of their catch. A 485,000-lb 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(219,992-kg) quota will probably reduce potential 1994 landings by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 15 percent or about $1,000 per SPL holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 2 is expected to be submitted by the Gulf and South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atlantic Councils in July 1994 for review and, if approved, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation by the Secretary of Commerce. Amendment 2 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the measures in this emergency interim rule on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent basis and include a phase out schedule for live rock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvests in other areas.

Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The South Atlantic Council and NMFS have concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present situation constitutes biological and conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergencies, which are properly addressed by this emergency interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of emergency rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation: (1) Results from recent, unforeseen events or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently discovered circumstances; (2) presents a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management problem; and (3) realizes immediate benefits from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency interim rule that outweigh the value of advance notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment, and deliberative consideration expected under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal rulemaking process. The basis for the conclusions regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency guidelines (1) and (2) is summarized above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the realization of immediate benefits, the South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atlantic Council has determined that an emergency rule under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act is the only means for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately addressing the biological emergency involving the live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rock resources of the Florida Keys and the remainder of the areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off the southern Atlantic states. Going through the formal FMP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment process without the emergency rule would delay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the required measures and would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial damage to live rock resources and fishery habitats off 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the southern Atlantic states. The immediate benefit of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency interim rule is that it will prevent expansion of live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rock collection in the area north of Florida's Dade County, protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Florida reef tract from chipping, and limit the rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting that causes serious damage to habitat in the area of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida Keys until a phase out can be implemented under Amendment 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the normal FMP amendment and rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS concurs with the South Atlantic Council's findings about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the biological emergency and the need for immediate regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective initially for 90 days, as authorized by section 305(c) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Magnuson Act. By agreement of NMFS and the South Atlantic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council, this emergency interim rule may be extended for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional period of 90 days.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This emergency interim rule has been determined to be not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA finds that the immediate need to prevent environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), as such procedures would be contrary to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest. Similarly, the need to implement these measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a timely manner to address the conservation and biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergencies described above, constitutes good cause under authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), to waive the 30 day delay in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes new requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration of designated fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CAA). The registration requirements are organized within a three-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tier structure. Tier 1 requires F/FA manufacturers to perform a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide qualitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure information. Tier 2 requires biological testing for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of subchronic systemic and organ toxicity, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment of specific health effects endpoints. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, Tier 3, which includes follow-up studies or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional tests, may be required. The rule permits adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing test data to be submitted in lieu of conducting new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duplicative tests. It also includes special provisions for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses and certain types of products, and a grouping system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which permits manufacturers of similar F/FA products to share the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of compliance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 2,300 fuels and 4,800 fuel additives were registered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA as of March 1994 and, to some degree, each of them produces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions which may contribute to potentially harmful air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution. The primary purpose of today's rule is to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration requirements which will provide information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying and evaluating the potential adverse effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related regulatory actions in the future as specified in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211 of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previous actions have implemented CAA sections 211(a) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(b)(1), which govern the general registration of F/FAs, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as CAA section 211(f). Today's rule amends 40 CFR part 79 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by adding regulatory provisions requiring the testing of F/FAs as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a requirement for registration, as stipulated in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(b)(2) and section 211(e) of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing these additional statutory provisions, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule focuses on the identification and evaluation of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse health effects associated with F/FA evaporative and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion emissions. The required health effects evaluation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organized in a tiered structure, and includes emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization, literature search, and biological testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Although this testing framework focuses on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of health effects, F/FA manufacturers are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to perform data searches to obtain information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential welfare effects of F/FA emissions. In addition, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to use existing procedures under CAA section 211(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the evaluation of potential effects of F/FAs on ECS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate use of the registration information to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in compliance with this rule is to guide EPA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential future regulatory actions under CAA section 211(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(c) provides authority for the possible control or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare. Evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of adverse effects of F/FA emissions on ECS performance, obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under CAA section 211(f) or from other sources, could also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by EPA to support such regulatory decisions.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legal Authority and Statutory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive and prohibits manufacturers of designated fuels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives from selling such products unless they have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered by EPA in accordance with CAA section 211(b). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration requirements, as stipulated by CAA section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(b)(1), that included: commercial identifying information, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(b)(2) of the CAA also gives EPA discretionary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to establish additional registration requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to this section, EPA ``may also require the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any fuel or fuel additive to conduct tests to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential public health effects of such fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including, but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions and determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public health and welfare. The statute further stipulates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that testing for health effects is to be conducted according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and protocols established by the Administrator, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that test results will not be considered confidential. Once the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer has completed registration requirements and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given assurances that the Agency will be notified of future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in that information, CAA section 211(b)(3) directs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator to register the fuel or fuel additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of F/FAs under CAA section 211(b)(2) as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general registration regulations issued in 1975. However, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAA Amendments of 1977 (PL 95&hyph;95, August 7, 1977), Congress added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory and contained additional provisions requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the regulations within one year of enactment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAA Amendments. In an effort to fulfill this requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1978 (see 43 FR 38607, August 29, 1978; Docket ORD&hyph;78&hyph;01). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the rulemaking process did not go forward during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next ten years and the rule was not finalized. Nevertheless, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action remained on EPA's regulatory agenda and a development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan for the rulemaking was created in 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to promulgate F/FA testing regulations within the one-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year deadline stipulated in CAA section 211(e). EPA entered into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Consent Decree in settlement of this lawsuit which, together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with subsequent modifications, established the rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule. Accordingly, a new ANPRM was published on August 7, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 (55 FR 32218) and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13168). Public hearings as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as periods for written commentary followed both of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publications. On February 24, 1994, EPA published a Notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reopening of Comment Period (59 FR 8886) requesting public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on several compliance-related and technical issues that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed clarification and/or reconsideration. Today's action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culminates the rulemaking process by promulgating F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration requirements under CAA sections 211(b)(2) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(e).

B. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the months following the publication of the ANPRM (55 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32218) and the associated public hearing (on September 26, 1990), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA explored the feasibility and appropriateness of applying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory negotiation procedures (under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 583 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990) to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of this rule. Interviews and meetings were held with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives of a variety of affected industry groups and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental organizations, to assess their interest and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
willingness to participate in potential negotiations. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process indicated that there was insufficient support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory negotiation among a number of key parties. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditional rulemaking procedure was then followed to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the proposed rule, EPA held a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing on May 28, 1992, and accepted comments until June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30, 1992. Public response on the NPRM included five oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentations at the hearing and the subsequent submission of 42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written comments. EPA also received 13 written comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues discussed in the Notice of Reopening of Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(referred to as the ``Reopening Notice'' in later portions of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document). A transcript of both public hearings and copies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all written comments are available in public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A discussion of comments received since the NPRM and EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses are included in the ``Summary and Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations,'' which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available in the public docket referenced above. All public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentary was carefully considered in developing this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. Major areas of comment are described in the relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of this preamble.

C. Additional Information on the Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effective date of this rule is May 27, 1994. EPA notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the general requirement (under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), that publication or service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a substantive rule be made not less than 30 days before its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date, does not apply here. Under 5 U.S.C. 559, the APA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that a subsequent statute does not supersede or modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA except to the extent that it does so expressly. CAA section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
307(d)(1)(E) specifically applies to the promulgation or revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any regulation pertaining to any fuel or fuel additive under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAA section 211. CAA section 307(d)(1) further provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``[t]he provisions of sections 533 through 557 and section 706 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title VI shall not, except as expressly provided in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsection, apply to actions to which this subsection applies.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nowhere does subsection 307(d) expressly provide that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553(d) of title 5 applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, CAA section 211(e)(2) expressly provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time period for providing the ``requisite information'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(e)(2) is based on the ``date of promulgation'' of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. Therefore, the requirements under CAA section 211(e)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are effective on May 27, 1994. Additionally, even if section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553(d) were to apply to the portion of the rule promulgated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the authority of section 211(b) of the CAA, there is good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 553(d)(3) of the APA to provide less than 30 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice following publication in order to simplify implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the rule by establishing one effective date for the rule's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. As discussed in the following sections, this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule provides a six year time period for completing Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, commencing on May 27, 1994. EPA believes this to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient for the regulated industry to comply with the rule and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, given this compliance schedule, a reasonable amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice is provided for this type of information-gathering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Finally, EPA has taken steps to provide notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final action to the regulated industry upon signature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. For these reasons, EPA believes that establishing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date as May 27, 1994 is reasonable.

III. Overview of Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overall Scope and Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of this rule apply to all types of F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have been designated to be registered by EPA (see Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.A.3). Based on the provisions of CAA section 211(e), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements must be satisfied both by manufacturers of F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products registered at the time of promulgation as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of F/FA products seeking registration after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation. Considering the large number of F/FA products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated and the potential burden of the program on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated industry, this final rule maintains the grouping system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the tiered approach proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grouping system allows manufacturers of similar products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to share the costs of testing. Rather than mandating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive testing as a routine registration requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every registered fuel and fuel additive, the grouping system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits the testing of one product as a representative of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively similar products (see Section IV of this preamble). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the testing program is designed to address testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs on a tiered basis, with allowance for more rigorous, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource-intensive requirements contained in each successive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tier. A detailed description of the scope and requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each individual tier is provided in Sections VII, VIII, and IX of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this preamble, and procedures for generating the emissions to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested are explained in Section VI. Additional special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions to reduce the burden on the regulated industry are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in Section X. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the program required by this final rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the CAA and reflects a reasonable and cost-conscious approach to a very complex regulatory area.
The following sections present a general overview of the main provisions of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Tiered Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As depicted in Figure 1, the registration program's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are organized within a three-tier structure. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, each tier is intended to function as a screen for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the need for more rigorous requirements in subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tiers. Consistent with CAA section 211(e)(3), which authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to avoid duplication of effort, the tiered approach permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FA manufacturers to use test results and other information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may already be available about their products.

Content of Tiers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as may be modified by any applicable special provisions, the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 are mandatory for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all fuels and fuel additives. These requirements may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied by manufacturers either on an individual basis or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way of a group submission consistent with the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouping system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Tier 1, F/FA manufacturers are required to perform a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide a qualitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure analysis based on total annual production volume and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market distribution data (see Section VII for details on Tier 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements). The modeling analyses proposed in the NPRM have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been eliminated from Tier 1 as explained in Section III.C of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble. Tier 2 (see Section VIII) includes biological testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for specific health effect endpoints, as well as general systemic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and organ toxicity. The Tier 2 biological testing requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of laboratory animals to the whole emissions of fuels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive/base fuel mixtures.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 To the extent that previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted studies are available which are at least comparable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specified guidelines for the chemical and/or biological tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in Tiers 1 and 2, such existing data may be submitted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lieu of performing and reporting on new duplicative tests (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VII.A.2).

The results of Tiers 1 and 2 are to be reported to EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the report formats described in Section XII. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will evaluate these results to determine if additional testing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis may be indicated under the provisions of Tier 3. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purpose of peer review during this evaluation process, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may furnish the submitted data to, and consult with, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, such as the Health Effects Institute. Tier 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests will be determined on a case-by-case basis at EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion, as discussed in Section IX. The specific objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and scope of Tier 3 tests will vary depending on the concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the earlier tiers or any other information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to EPA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timing of Requirements: Registered F/FAs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposed to require that Tier 1 and Tier 2 data be submitted within three years for registered F/FAs. In their comments
on the proposal the regulated industry suggested that it would not be possible to complete Tier 2 testing within three

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. As detailed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these commenters stated that the number of F/FAs to be tested, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time needed for development of detailed test protocols, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lack of available test facilities were inconsistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-year time frame for completion of Tier 1 and Tier 2 for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs (or groups). None of the commenters, however, suggested an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative time frame within which the testing of all F/FAs (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups) could be completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has thoroughly considered these comments and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly, has taken a number of measures to streamline the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. As discussed later in this preamble, such measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the deletion from the final rule of some requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the NPRM (e.g., quantitative modeling requirements), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the Tier 2 testing scenario for greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency, simplification of some of the grouping rules, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of special provisions which will result in a smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of F/FA products requiring testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that the number of laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities currently available to conduct the required emission-based toxicological tests is very limited. EPA
expects that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of this rule will create a demand for testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories which will encourage the reactivation, modification, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or expansion of existing laboratories, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of new facilities, to accommodate the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the F/FA registration program. However, there is likely to be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lag between the demand for and the availability of laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity. Thus, while EPA believes that some groups could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the testing required by the rule in three years, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely that not all of the F/FAs to be tested could complete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the three-year time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering these factors, the final rule allows a six-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for the conduct of Tier 2 testing for registered F/FAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This longer period will provide the necessary start-up time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories with previous experience in conducting studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably similar to those required in Tier 2 to adapt or build 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary facilities, organize the key technical personnel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conduct verification procedures. In this regard, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for each laboratory providing services for this program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to employ experts in each of the toxicology specialty fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by Tier 2. EPA recognizes that some of the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise may be in short supply, and envisions that laboratories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may subcontract with subspecialists as needed for evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test results. Furthermore, biological laboratories which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently offer inhalation toxicology testing services, but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not equipped to generate and deliver engine emissions for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, should be able to obtain the additional equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering expertise they will need in a relatively short period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time. Addition of emission generation capabilities by such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories will be facilitated by the fact that the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows the use of relatively inexpensive and possibly portable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine dynamometers for generating the required emissions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicological testing related both to light-duty and heavy-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine applications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that the necessary toxicology laboratory capacity will begin to come on line within 8&hyph;15 months
of the effective date of this rule, with expansion of capacity continuing for an additional 12&hyph;24 months thereafter.
The initial period should coincide with the start-up time needed by the regulated industry prior to beginning the
required Tier 2 testing. Manufacturers' start-up activities will include review and understanding of the requirements,
formation and functional organization of groups, acquisition of required test fuel supplies, and contracting for
data gathering and testing services. EPA estimates that these activities can generally be accomplished in 6&hyph;12
months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With six years provided for full Tier 2 completion, sufficient time should then be available for completion of all
Tier 2 testing. However, this assumes that the regulated industry will not purposely delay the onset of testing. If
all F/FA groups wait until the fourth and fifth years to begin the Tier 2 testing, it will again become likely that some
will not be able to complete the requirements on time. In such instances, the responsible manufacturers will have
failed to comply with the requirements of this rule and will be subject to enforcement action and/or loss of registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in the case of registered F/FA products, this final rule requires the submission within three years from the
effective date of all applicable Tier 1 requirements plus either: (1) Submittal of all Tier 2 requirements or (2) evidence
of a contractual obligation with a qualified laboratory to conduct the required Tier 2 tests.

 If, within the first three years, a contract for Tier 2 is submitted rather than the Tier 2 data itself, then the final
Tier 2 report is due to EPA no later than six years of the effective date of this rule. Both Tiers 1 and 2 are mandatory.
Failure to submit Tier 2 data for a registered F/FA within six years of the effective date of this rule will subject the
manufacturer to enforcement action and/or revocation of the registration. In the case of F/FAs for which Tier 2 testing
is not required because of special provisions, all applicable requirements are due to EPA within the initial three-year
period after promulgation of this rule.

To be qualified, a laboratory must be able to perform inhalation toxicology tests in compliance with the Good Laboratory
Practice requirement in this rule, including monitoring by an onsite Quality Assurance Unit. It must also be able
to properly and safely store, transport, and use F/FAs. The study director must be a professional scientist with a
doctoral degree in toxicology or equivalent. Other individuals engaged in the conduct of the studies shall have the
education, training, and/or experience to enable proper performance of the assigned functions. The laboratory's
animal handling facility must be registered and in good standing with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Accreditation
with a recognized independent organization which sets laboratory animal handling standards [e.g., the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)] is required.

Existing F/FA registrations are also conditional on satisfaction of any Tier 3 requirements which might be prescribed
by the Agency pursuant to CAA section 211(b). When Tier 3 testing is prescribed for a registered F/FA product, the existing
registration will be extended for that time which EPA specifies as necessary for completion of the additional requirements.
Maintenance of registration will depend upon satisfactory compliance with these requirements.

EPA is promulgating Tier 2 testing requirements under the authority of both sections 211(b) and 211(e) of the CAA.
The requirements for Tier 2 testing are all within EPA's discretion under section 211(b). Section 211(b) gives the
Administrator broad authority ``for the purpose of registration of fuels and fuel additives'' to require manufacturers
``to conduct tests to determine potential public health effects of such fuel or fuel additive.'' EPA interprets ``for
the purpose of registration'' to encompass both gaining and maintaining registration for F/FAs. This interpretation
is supported by section 211(e), which requires implementation of section 211(b) authority with respect to both registered
and new F/FAs and mandates that EPA require testing of F/FAs. The legislative history supports such a view. The 1977
House Report,

Tier 2 involves testing ``to determine potential public health effects'' of F/FAs and, therefore, is within the type
of testing that section 211(b) allows EPA to require. The timing requirements of Tier 2 are also within EPA's discretion
under section 211(b), for section 211(b) leaves submission deadlines to EPA's discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timing for Tier 2 submissions is also governed, at least in part, by section 211(e)(2). That section requires that,
for F/FAs registered when the rule is promulgated, ``requisite information'' be submitted within three years of
the promulgation date. ``Requisite information'' is not defined in the statute. EPA proposed to interpret ``requisite
information'' as the data required by Tiers 1 and 2. In part this was based on EPA's understanding that Congress intended
that the testing rule promulgated under section 211(e) would require manufacturers to conduct testing_not merely
conduct a literature search and compile studies that had already been conducted. As a practical matter, however,
EPA now believes that the Tier 2 tests cannot be completed for all F/FAs within three years. EPA believes this makes
its proposed definition of ``requisite information'' unreasonable and requires a different interpretation of
``requisite information.''

EPA considered redefining ``requisite information'' to mean studies that could be completed for all F/FAs within
three years. Given the time frame, laboratory availability, and the number of groups to be tested, EPA was not sure
that any meaningful health effects testing could be accomplished for all groups within three years. Certainly, such
testing could not include testing of combustion and evaporation products for all groups. As discussed elsewhere,
EPA believes that the testing of combustion and evaporative emissions included in Tier 2 is part of the basic testing
necessary to evaluate potential health effects, because people are exposed to both combustion and evaporative emissions.
Therefore, EPA would require this testing under section 211(b) regardless of whether the testing is required by section
211(e)(2). If EPA had chosen to interpret ``requisite information'' to be testing that could be done in three years,
EPA would have, in any case, required such testing in addition to the Tier 2 testing required by this rule. This would
likely have delayed submission of the information that EPA believes to be necessary (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the combustion emissions testing and evaporative emissions testing).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's rule, EPA interprets ``requisite information'' as either data required by Tiers 1 and 2 or data required
by Tier 1 and a commitment to conduct Tier 2 testing. EPA believes that this meets the congressional mandate to require
emissions speciation testing and a demonstration that manufacturers are making progress in their testing by requiring
submission of evidence of a contract with a qualified laboratory to conduct the Tier 2 studies. In addition, this interpretation
imposes testing costs on manufacturers only for types of studies that EPA believes are necessary and useful, and it
requires manufacturers to finish testing in a time frame that EPA believes is possible to meet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if ``requisite information'' were interpreted to mean only data required by Tier 1, EPA would still impose Tier
2 testing and timing requirements as contained in today's rule. In that case, section 211(e) would require Tier 1 data
to be submitted within three years of this rule's promulgation, and section 211(b) would provide authority for EPA
to impose the Tier 2 testing requirements in the time frame set forth in this rule.

Timing of Requirements: Registrable and New F/FAs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with section 211(e), for F/FAs not yet registered, all test requirements must be satisfied prior to registration,
including any Tier 3 requirements which EPA judges to be necessary. However, as discussed in the Reopening Notice,
this final rule makes a distinction between ``registrable'' and truly ``new'' F/FA products. Registrable F/FAs
are products
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 that are not registered as of the effective date of this rule but that meet the program's criteria for grouping with
a currently registered fuel or bulk additive
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 in the same fuel family.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Conversely, a F/FA product not registered as of the effective date of this rule is designated as ``new'' if it does not
meet the program's criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive in the same fuel family.
In the above definitions, the term ``currently'' refers to the date on which EPA receives the basic registration data
for the F/FA product in question.

A ``bulk additive,'' sometimes called a ``general use'' additive, is defined as a product added to fuel at the refinery
as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery, but before the fuel is purchased
for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. In contrast, an ``aftermarket additive,'' sometimes called
a ``consumer additive,'' is an additive product which is added by the end-user directly to fuel in a motor vehicle or
engine to modify the performance or other characteristics of the fuel, the engine, or its emissions.

``Fuel family'' refers to the primary categorization of F/FAs in the grouping system of this registration program,
as described in Section IV. A fuel family is defined as a set of F/FAs which share basic chemical and physical formulation
characteristics and can be used in the same engine or vehicle. In the definition of ``registrable'', the restriction
``in the same fuel family'' means that the similarity of an applicant F/FA product to a bulk additive currently registered
for use in another fuel family will not suffice to make the applicant F/FA product registrable. This restriction is
consistent with the general principles of the grouping system, which permits grouping of F/FAs only within the defined
fuel families.

Revision of an existing registration (e.g., addition or deletion of a currently-registered bulk additive to an existing
fuel registration) does not constitute a new registration (assuming any added bulk additive is registered for use
in fuels of the same type). However, test requirements may change if the revision causes the fuel product to change
from one group to another.

For registrable products, similar testing and compliance requirements apply as those pertaining to currently registered
F/FAs in the same group. Upon the manufacturer's submittal of the basic registration data and other pre-Tier 1 application
requirements for a registrable product, registration will be granted by EPA. Once registered, these products will
be legally able to enter the market. The manufacturer will have the same period of time after the effective date of this
rule for the completion of Tiers 1 and 2 as the applicable group of existing F/FAs, and can satisfy these requirements
either by joining the existing group or by testing individually. On the other hand, manufacturers of new F/FA products
(

not fitting the registrable criteria) are required to submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including
Tier 3 when prescribed by the Agency. Thus, if EPA identifies a need for additional testing at the Tier 3 level for a new
F/FA product, registration will not occur until satisfactory completion of all such requirements.

As discussed in the NPRM and in the Reopening Notice, EPA interprets CAA section 211(b) in conjunction with CAA section
211(c), which gives EPA authority to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offering
for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive if the Administrator finds that the emission products of such fuel or fuel
additive ``cause[s], or contribute[s], to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public
health or welfare.'' In light of this responsibility, EPA believes that it should exercise particular caution in
registering new F/FA products and that it should have the necessary information to evaluate fully the potential public
health consequences of such new F/FAs prior to allowing their introduction into the market. Thus, before granting
registration to manufacturers of new F/FAs, under the authority of CAA section 211(b), this final rule requires that
they comply with all testing requirements.

Figure 2 summarizes the decision process for determining whether an unregistered F/FA product (i.e., a F/FA product
not registered as of the effective date of this rule) is ``registrable'' and thus handled much like a currently registered
F/FA product, or whether an unregistered F/FA product is ``new'' and must complete all testing requirements before
registration is granted.

An unregistered F/FA product which meets the criteria for grouping only with a currently registered aftermarket
additive (and not with a currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) is not designated as registrable. This does
not necessarily preclude an unregistered aftermarket additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives
can group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the registration status of currently registered aftermarket
additives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in gasoline and meeting
the criteria for grouping with baseline gasoline fuels and bulk additives will be registrable.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 On the other hand, an unregistered chromium-containing additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in
gasoline will be considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable,'' because there are no currently registered chromium-containing
fuels or bulk additives in the gasoline fuel family with which the applicant additive could be grouped. Even if a chromium-containing
product had previously been registered as an aftermarket additive for gasoline [e.g., as a ``grandfathered'' product
registered prior to the ban of such aftermarket additives under CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)]
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 or as a bulk additive for use in another fuel family (e.g., diesel fuel), the applicant additive would still be considered
``new''.

Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying
only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of
the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements in addition
to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA Amendments,
all types of motor vehicle F/FAs were placed under section 211(f) jurisdiction. [However, section 211(f) provisions
do not apply until certification requirements are promulgated for the specific motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.]
All aftermarket additives that were not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990
were banned. However, this ban did not apply retroactively. Thus, ``non- substantially similar'' gasoline aftermarket
additives which had been registered prior to November 15, 1990 have been allowed to retain their registrations. These
are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA believes that the distinctions between registrable and new F/FAs, both
in terms of their definitions and their respective compliance requirements, reflect reasonable regard for the public
health and welfare without undue interference in the F/FA marketplace. Because registrable F/FAs are defined such
that they must be reasonably similar in composition and usage to current F/FAs, their entry into the market will generally
not be expected to increase the health or welfare risks potentially related to current F/FA emission exposures, assuming
the overall rate of usage does not increase substantially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule implements EPA's policy that F/FAs that may pose new or different health risks to the public should not
be allowed on the market until EPA has determined that adequate health testing has been conducted. Because it would
cause significant hardships to pull all currently used products off the market until they were tested, products that
are already registered may continue to be sold. If these principles were strictly applied (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA refused to register any specific product that does not currently have a registration), there could be significant
stagnation in the marketplace_a new company that wanted to sell the same unleaded gasoline that everyone else is selling
would be prevented from getting a registration until it had tested its gasoline product. Thus, today's rule allows
new registrants to sell products that are similar to registered products in terms of: (1) Expected health effects;
and (2) usage (and, therefore, type or extent of exposure) currently allowed by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an unregistered product can group with a registered product, EPA has determined that the products should have similar
health effects. To ensure that usage (and, therefore, type or extent of exposure) is similar to a registered product,
under today's rule, a manufacturer cannot rely on registration of an aftermarket fuel additive or on a F/FA in a different
fuel family. Considering a fuel or bulk additive to be registrable based on an aftermarket additive registration
could significantly increase the public exposure to that F/FA. Generally, aftermarket additives are relatively
limited in distribution and usage and, therefore, in exposure. Thus, in seeking a registration for a new product,
a manufacturer cannot rely on the registration of aftermarket additives or any F/FA product in a fuel family other
than the one for which the registration is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is consistent with Congress' intent in CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) to preclude introduction into commerce of new
aftermarket additives which do not fit the ``substantially similar'' 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
criteria.

 Looking only to F/FAs in the same fuel family to determine registrability is also intended to prevent potential increases
in exposure to untested products. Expanding the use of an additive from one fuel family to another (e.g., from diesel
fuel to gasoline) would significantly increase the overall size of the potential market for the product and thus the
potential exposure to its emissions.

EPA interprets section 211(e) to support the distinction between registered or registrable F/FAs and new F/FAs.
EPA believes that the reference in CAA section 211(e)(2) (A) and (B) to a ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered''
or ``which is not registered'' is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the F/FA product generally or to a particular
product-specific registration. Given this ambiguity, EPA believes that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase
``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' to refer to the F/FAs generally. A contrary interpretation would result
in EPA allowing numerous types of unleaded gasoline to be sold under existing registrations, while at the same time
denying a registration (until completion of necessary testing) to a new company that wanted to sell the same type of
unleaded gasoline that many others now sell. As discussed above, for ``registrable'' products, such an interference
in the market would not likely result in any public health benefit. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret
the phrase ``registered'' to include both F/FAs that are either ``registered'' or ``registrable.'' ``Registrable''
F/FAs are sufficiently similar in composition and use to existing F/FAs that one would not expect them to have dissimilar
health effects; and therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered fuel or fuel additive'' to include
not only those F/FAs that are identical, but also those that can group with existing F/FAs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, EPA believes that the above approach is consistent with section 211 because EPA interprets section
211(e)(3) (A) and (B) in conjunction with section 211(e)(3)(C), which gives EPA authority to exempt any F/FA product
from duplicative testing. Thus, even if one interprets the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which [is/is not] registered''
to mean either that an identical F/FA product must already have a registration, or to refer to a product-specific registration,
EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret section 211(e)(3)(C) to allow F/FAs that are similar in composition and
usage to those already on the market to group with those similar F/FAs and complete the testing with the other F/FAs
in their group. At the same time, EPA believes that for F/FAs that differ significantly in composition or usage from
currently registered F/FAs, such testing would not be duplicative of testing of registered 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FAs;&blank;and therefore, EPA is authorized under section 211(e) to require this information prior to registration.
Under either theory, EPA's authority to obtain information prior to registration is not limited to Tier 1 and Tier
2 data, because section 211(b)(2)(B) gives EPA authority to require for registration any information necessary
to assess the effects of emissions on public health or welfare. Therefore, EPA interprets section 211 (e) and (b) to
give it the authority to require any necessary health or welfare effects information for F/FAs that are significantly
different in composition or usage from currently registered products.

Changes to 40 CFR Part 79. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes revisions to the current 40 CFR part 79 registration regulations which are necessary to properly
implement the new testing requirements in Subpart F. These consist of various conforming changes in registration
procedures, requirements, and terminology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submission by which a manufacturer requests registration of a fuel or fuel additive product is now called an ``application''
rather than a ``notification,'' in order to better reflect the additional submissions and requirements upon which
registration is now contingent, and to avoid confusion with the various notifications concerning testing requirements
which will be transmitted to applicants and registrants by EPA. Conforming changes have been made in procedures for
notifying an applicant that a submission does not comply with registration requirements and for granting registration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in Section IV of this preamble, in order to determine in which of the F/FA group(s) established under the
criteria set forth in this rule (see &sect;79.56) a particular fuel additive should be enrolled, and to administer
applicable testing requirements separately for each such F/FA group, it is essential that fuel additives be deemed
to be registered only for those specific types of fuel for which they will be sold and used. The Agency interprets and
is already administering the existing part 79 in this manner. However, in the conforming changes included in this
rule, part 79 has been clarified to confirm that registration of fuel additives is fuel specific, and that EPA considers
sale or distribution of a fuel additive product for use in a fuel for which it is not registered to be unlawful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a manufacturer seeking to register a fuel product or a fuel additive product for use in vehicles manufactured
after 1974 must demonstrate that it is ``substantially similar'' to fuels or additives utilized in the certification
of vehicles for 1975 or subsequent model years, or that the manufacturer has obtained a waiver under CAA section 211(f)(4).
This expressly codifies the manner in which EPA has administered the registration program since it adopted criteria
implementing the statutory prohibition in CAA section 211(f)(1) on introduction into commerce of fuels and fuel
additives which are not ``substantially similar.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Program Focus On Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 211 gives the Agency discretion to determine the focus of the F/FA testing program under CAA section 211(b).
EPA is exercising its discretion by focusing this rule on the testing of emissions, because the main purpose of the
testing program is to provide EPA with information that can be used in regulatory decision-making under CAA section
211(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(c) of the CAA gives EPA the authority to regulate F/FAs based on the impact of their emissions on public
health or welfare. Specifically, it allows the Administrator to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction
into commerce, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission product(s) cause or contribute to harmful air pollution.
The legislative history of the provision also supports a focus on emissions, since House and Senate Reports on the
CAA Amendments of 1970 link the information to be obtained under CAA section 211(b) to EPA's authority to regulate
emissions under CAA section 211(c).
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Thus in the NPRM, EPA proposed to focus this rule's requirements on the potential emissions-based effects of F/FAs
rather than on the effects of the raw (i.e., uncombusted) F/FA product. Public comment received after publication
of the NPRM generally supported the proposed emissions-based focus of the rule. Accordingly, EPA has retained this
focus in today's action. The health effects testing requirements of this final rule specifically address the effects
of inhalation exposure to F/FA combustion and evaporative emissions. The required testing focuses on the evaluation
of health effects of the whole emissions of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture of interest and not on the toxicity
of the individual emission products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this rule, combustion emissions are the primary exhaust products of the combustion of a fuel or
additive/base fuel mixture in a motor vehicle engine and do not include secondary atmospheric transformation products.
EPA recognizes that secondary air pollutants are a factor in the characterization of overall risks associated with
F/FA emissions. However, it is not feasible to include this type of laboratory testing as a standard requirement at
this time. When required in specific instances, transformation products will be addressed under Tier 3, as described
in Section III.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, evaporative emission testing is to be performed for F/FAs meeting specific volatility criteria. While
some commenters asked EPA to eliminate the evaporative emission testing from the program, today's rule maintains
this requirement. EPA's decision is supported by the legislative history, which expresses the concerns of Congress
about the public health impacts of emissions from both combustion and evaporative sources. Public exposure to evaporative
emissions is still significant and, for many F/FAs, the toxicity of evaporative emissions as a whole mixture has not
been characterized. Thus, this rule includes requirements for the characterization and biological testing of evaporative
emissions in certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While combustion emissions are inevitable products of the engine combustion process, the significance of evaporative
emissions depends on the type of F/FA product. As proposed in the NPRM, this final rule specifies criteria for determining
the need for evaporative emission testing. For fuels that are supplied to motor vehicle engines by way of sealed containment
and delivery systems, evaporative emissions testing is less important, since human and environmental exposure
should be extremely low or nonexistent. Thus, evaporative emissions testing under this final rule would not apply
to methane (compressed natural gas or liquified natural gas) or propane (liquified petroleum gas) formulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For liquid F/FAs, the significance of vaporization varies widely, depending largely on the volatility of the fuel
or additive/base fuel mixture. Thus, this final rule uses the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of a fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture to determine its applicability for evaporative emissions testing. An RVP of 2.0 pounds per square inch
(psi) is designated as the threshold for determining the need for evaporative emission testing for fuels. That is,
fuels with RVP of 2.0 psi or greater are subject to the evaporative emissions testing requirements, while those with
RVP less than 2.0 psi are excused from the evaporative emission testing requirements under Tier 1 and Tier 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to additives, the NPRM proposed to require evaporative emission testing if the RVP of the additive/base
fuel mixture was increased by 0.1 psi or more in comparison with the RVP of the base fuel alone. However, methods for
measurement of vapor pressure have a reproducibility of about 0.3 psi.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 To account for this limitation of measurement accuracy, especially when dealing with low pressure measurements,
today's rule uses a 0.4 psi criterion (i.e., 0.1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.3) for additives. Accordingly, this final rule requires the evaporative emission testing of additives when the
RVP of the associated fuel in the additive/base fuel mixture is increased by 0.4 psi 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 2.0 psi or more.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 For example, an additive that causes an increase of 0.6 psi when mixed with a fuel with a vapor pressure of 1.0 psi (i.e.,
the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 1.6), need not be tested for evaporative emissions. On the other
hand, an additive that causes an increase of 1.1 psi when mixed with a fuel with RVP of 1.0 psi is required to undergo evaporative
emission testing because the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 2.1 psi.

The requirement to test the evaporative emissions of a qualifying additive product do not apply if the manufacturer
intends to satisfy the test requirements of the additive as part of a group, of which another member product or a base
fuel serves as the group representative, and the manufacturer does not specifically test the additive apart from
the group. See Section IV for a discussion on grouping provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above defined thresholds are used by EPA in determining the applicability of evaporative emission testing for
the purposes of Tier 1 and Tier 2. However, EPA retains the authority to require evaporative emission testing under
Tier 3 for fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures with low vapor pressure, e.g., RVP less than 2.0, if there is a health
or welfare concern associated with the evaporative emissions of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in question.
For example, if a highly toxic substance is present in a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, EPA could require evaporative
emission testing under Tier 3, even if the RVP of the F/FA product in question is below 2.0 psi. These special cases will
be handled on a case-by-case basis under Tier 3.

3. Program Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of this rule apply to manufacturers (including importers) of designated fuels or fuel additives
and to any F/FA manufacturer [see &sect;79.2(d) and (f) as amended in this rule] seeking registration under CAA section
211(a) and 211(b). A fuel is defined to be any material which is capable of releasing energy or power by combustion or
other chemical or physical reaction [see 40 CFR &sect;79.2(c)]. A fuel additive is defined as any substance that is
intentionally added to a fuel (including any added to a motor vehicle's fuel system) and that is not intentionally
removed prior to sale or use (see 40 CFR &sect;79.2(e), as amended in this rule), including both bulk and aftermarket
additives.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the present time, the designation of F/FAs encompasses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both leaded and unleaded gasoline F/FAs and diesel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and commercially distributed for use in motor vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended only for off-road use (e.g., farm and construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, aircraft, boats, railroad engines) are not currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated to be registered, and thus are not subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of today's rule. However, if off-road F/FAs become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated in the future (according to provisions under CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 213), this rule will be modified, as needed, to cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the designated F/FAs include leaded gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations, CAA section 211(n) provides that ``after December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31, 1995 it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sale, supply, offer for supply, dispense, transport, or introduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into commerce, for use as fuel in any motor vehicle (as defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 7554(a) of this title) any gasoline which contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead or lead additives.'' Because of the upcoming ban of leaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs, compliance with the requirements in today's rule will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superfluous for manufacturers of leaded products. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaded fuel family has been deleted from this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While alternative fuels and their additives are currently on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the market, they are not yet designated and thus not yet required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be registered. However, because they are currently used and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA contemplates their future designation, this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes provisions for their registration and testing. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative fuels for which provisions are included are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural gas (LNG), and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently developing the proposal for the designation of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative fuels and their additives. In that proposal, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently intends to propose to set an effective date for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final designation rule far enough in the future so that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs could complete whatever pre-registration testing would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required prior to the time they would be required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered. EPA currently believes the delay of the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the designation rule would be justified by the need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize disruptions in an existing market for alternative F/FAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains a number of special provisions which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce or modify the program's requirements for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers or certain classes of products. Such special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions apply to small businesses (as defined in this rule) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and manufacturers of experimental F/FAs, relabeled products, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aerosols. These provisions are described in Section X of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Health Evaluation Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The testing program established in this rule focuses on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification and evaluation of potential adverse health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with inhalation exposure to F/FA emissions. The Tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 testing program of this rule addresses, in addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of inquiry mandated by the statute (carcinogenicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teratogenicity, and mutagenicity), specific assessments designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to detect potential pulmonary, neurotoxic, and general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive effects of F/FA emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, short-term (42-day) tests were proposed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 to address each of the health effect endpoints described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above. However, in response to public commentary and EPA's own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, the Tier 2 testing requirements have been modified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Today's rule uses a comprehensive 90-day subchronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhalation protocol and ancillary tests to examine general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systemic and organ toxicity (including pulmonary toxicity), as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as the specific areas of concern described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These evaluations require the exposure of laboratory animals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the whole emissions of F/FAs. Tier 2 tests are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted for both combustion and (when applicable) evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. The subchronic inhalation protocol allows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of specific endpoints within the 90-day testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
framework. For example, pulmonary and neurotoxic effects are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined in conjunction with the subchronic study standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histopathological requirements. The neurotoxicity assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also includes a biochemical assay to measure the level of glial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Coordinated with the 90-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study is a battery of three assays used in the evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenicity and mutagenicity: the in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vitro 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salmonella assay, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
micronucleus assay, and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sister chromatid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange assay. A fertility assessment that looks at both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive and teratogenic effects is also coordinated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general toxicity study. The assessment for reproductive effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves the mating of exposed animals, the measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive cycles, and the histopathology of male and female 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive organs. The teratogenic assessment requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of pregnant females to F/FA emissions and the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of the uterus and its contents just prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal time of parturition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the evaluation of the health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above, EPA retains the authority under Tier 3 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require additional testing on a case-by-case basis on those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints evaluated under Tier 2 and/or on other endpoints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern. Further discussion about the specific requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tiers 1, 2, and 3 is provided in Sections VII&hyph;IX.

C. Welfare Evaluation Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) states that the Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require manufacturers to furnish ``reasonable and necessary'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for determining ``the extent to which F/FA emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the public health or welfare''. The term ``welfare effects'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompasses a variety of complex and interrelated factors. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of motor vehicle F/FA emissions, welfare effects could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the impact of air pollution on the public health and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, including a broad range of effects on aquatic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrestrial ecosystems, cultivated crops and other vegetation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural and man-made materials, wildlife, and stratospheric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone. Air pollution effects on the public welfare also include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important environmental concerns such as noxious odors or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visibility impairment, which may detract from human well-being. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for stipulating that welfare effects should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed, the statute gives EPA broad discretion about how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address welfare effects. EPA recognizes that, at the present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, scientific experience and laboratory screening methods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evaluation of welfare effects are more limited than in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area of health effects. Thus, today's rule limits the routinely required welfare evaluation to requirements that
are coincident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or concurrent with the evaluation of health effects. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the literature search, emission characterization, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure analysis requirements of Tier 1. While at this time EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not requiring biological testing for welfare effects, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator retains the authority to require additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation and/or testing of welfare effects at the Tier 3 level, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the outcome of lower tiers demonstrates both significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental toxicity and exposure potential. EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the need for Tier 3 welfare effects testing on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require modeling analyses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric reactivity, environmental fate/partitioning, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure as part of the welfare evaluation. EPA requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on the feasibility of requiring such modeling analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a routine requirement for registration. Commenters urged EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to limit the modeling requirements due to the lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized methods in this area of study. Recognizing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations of modeling methods and the availability of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for some of the areas of study of interest in this rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule does not require modeling analyses as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that other EPA programs are actively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
researching and controlling mobile and stationary source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions to major air pollution problems such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tropospheric/stratospheric ozone, global warming, and acid rain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, modeled ozone reactivity data are already available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for most conventional and alternative fuels. EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if additional modeling is deemed necessary, this could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed by manufacturers under Tier 3. Also, EPA may conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simple modeling, using the emission data submitted by registrants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Tier 1, if needed for regulatory decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding environmental fate and exposure modeling, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that these types of analyses will be extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult due to the complex nature of F/FA emissions. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both environmental partitioning models and exposure models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address single compounds rather than mixtures, it would be unduly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome and unreasonable to require all registrants to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these analyses on each individual emission constituent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring the modeling of each individual emission product would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also result in duplication of information and, therefore, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be inconsistent with the original intent of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the environmental models are applicable only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a limited number of emission products for which appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical/chemical data are available in order to perform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. In terms of available exposure models, these usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rely on carbon monoxide monitoring data and related emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates to estimate potential exposures. This means that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of available exposure models is somewhat limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis of compounds whose chemical/physical behavior is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to carbon monoxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above factors, EPA believes that quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations of potential exposures and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fate/partitioning of F/FA emissions will be better addressed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Tier 3 level on a case-by-case basis, where they can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focused on specific compounds of potential environmental concern.

D. Requirements for Emission Control System Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 211(b)(2) requires F/FA manufacturers to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to determine their products' effects on ECS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. The NPRM stated that EPA intended to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing ECS performance through the existing waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application program under CAA section 211(f). The waiver program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevents the introduction into commerce of F/FAs which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly degrade the performance of emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Under CAA section 211(f), F/FA formulations which do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not meet specific chemical and physical criteria considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantially similar'' to EPA certification fuel (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretive rule in 56 FR 5352), cannot be introduced into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce unless a waiver is issued by EPA. The waiver process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then requires the applicant to demonstrate, through testing if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, that ``such fuel or fuel additive or a specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration thereof, and the emission products of such fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel additive or a specified concentration thereof, will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the emission standards to which it has been certified.'' For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products already registered that do not meet ``substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar'' criteria, i.e., grandfathered products that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered prior to the implementation of the waiver application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, EPA proposed to establish a mechanism that would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public to submit petitions to EPA requesting ECS testing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a particular fuel or fuel additive of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule reflects EPA's judgment that the mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already established under CAA section 211(f) are adequate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ECS testing of F/FAs. EPA's previous experience with the waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application process has demonstrated the practical value of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantially similar'' concept for determining whether a F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product needs to be tested for its effects on emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. EPA is not aware of instances in which products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting ``substantially similar'' criteria were later discovered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have adverse effects on vehicular emission control performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of another ECS testing program under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(b) would be duplicative and, therefore, inconsistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' intent. Thus, as proposed, today's rule refers to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver application process under CAA section 211(f)
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to obtain a waiver under CAA section 211(f)(4). Products which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform to applicable ``substantially similar'' criteria are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to undergo ECS testing before they can be registered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs which do not meet ``substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar'' criteria are subject to the standard 211(f) application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process prior to registration.

EPA recognizes that there are grandfathered F/FA products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see Section III.A above) which fall outside the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domain of CAA section 211(f). These grandfathered products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include gasoline aftermarket additives introduced prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 CAA Amendments. Therefore, statutory authority for the ECS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation and regulatory control of grandfathered products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists under CAA sections 211 (b) and (c) rather than section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(f). EPA judges that requiring ECS evaluation of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grandfathered products, without evidence of ECS problems, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unreasonable and unnecessarily burdensome on the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, today's rule provides a petition mechanism for the ECS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of grandfathered products. Under this mechanism, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could require ECS testing of grandfathered products, similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing which a waiver applicant would generally conduct, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so petitioned by outside parties or if other information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the Agency indicates that such evaluation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Such information might be obtained as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emission characterization requirements included in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. In addition, vehicle manufacturers or other outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties are allowed to submit petitions to EPA requesting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of grandfathered products based on evidence of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm to vehicular ECS. If EPA judges that ECS testing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted after reviewing the petition arguments, emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization results and/or other available information, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Objectives and Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 211(e) provides a number of mechanisms by which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may reduce the costs and burdens of compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration requirements set forth in CAA section 211(b). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, CAA section 211(e)(3)(B) permits the Administrator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``provide for cost-sharing with respect to the testing of any fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or fuel additive which is manufactured or processed by two or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more persons, or otherwise provide for shared responsibility'' so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the program requirements can be met without duplication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort. In accordance with this provision, today's rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains the grouping system proposed in the NPRM, which permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of similar F/FAs, on a voluntary basis, to pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their resources and efforts to satisfy the registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The groups defined by the specifications in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule are the only groups permitted for satisfying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the registration program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM, the grouping system allows similar fuels and additives to be grouped together, rather than
creating separate fuel groups and additive groups. This convention recognizes that, to meet the requirements of
this final rule, an additive must be mixed with its associated base fuel
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 prior to generating the emissions for testing. To the extent that the resulting additive/base fuel mixture is similar
to existing fuel formulations, the tests conducted on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture will be duplicative
of tests conducted on the related fuels. To avoid potential duplication, this final rule maintains the proposed approach,
in which closely-related fuels and additives are grouped together. Accordingly, the manufacturers of fuels and
the related additives can fulfill their individual registration responsibilities through jointly-supported
testing rather than through duplicative independent efforts. By grouping similar fuels and additives together,
the grouping scheme also avoids the need to define each generic product or product component as either a ``fuel'' or
an ``additive.'' This would otherwise present a problem when a given substance (or mixture) can serve as either a fuel
or an additive (e.g., ethanol).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA developed criteria for sorting individual F/FAs into groups of related formulations based on similarities
in the chemical/physical properties of the ``raw'' fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. EPA has maintained this approach
in the final rule. EPA expects F/FAs within each group to have similar emission characteristics and thus essentially
the same general effects on the public health and welfare. Therefore, chemical or toxicologic information associated
with individual members of a given group can reasonably be generalized to all F/FAs in the group. EPA will consider
tests performed on a selected representative of a group to apply to all members of the group for purposes of compliance
with registration requirements, for deciding whether to require additional testing under Tier 3, or for taking regulatory
action under CAA section 211(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive will still be held individually accountable for compliance with
the registration program, the grouping system provides an opportunity for meeting the program requirements in a
more cost-effective manner. Participation in the F/FA grouping system is strictly voluntary, and any manufacturer
may choose to fulfill the requirements on an individual basis. Those who choose to take advantage of the grouping opportunity
will be able to share their planning efforts, research capabilities, and financial resources to satisfy the information-gathering
and testing requirements of the F/FA registration program. To satisfy the chemical and biological testing requirements,
the required tests will be done on the selected representative for the respective group, rather than being repeated
for each of the F/FAs in the group. The results of the tests on the group representative will then be submitted jointly
for all members of the group, with applicable costs to be shared by the respective manufacturers (based on their cost-sharing
agreements, as discussed in Section IV.C). Manufacturers who question whether the results obtained for their group's
representative are valid for their own products may conduct confirmatory tests on their products on an independent
basis and at their own cost. However, until such independent test results are made available to EPA, the original results
submitted on behalf of the group will be considered valid for all member products, and could be applied by EPA to support
regulatory decisions under CAA section 211(c) or requirements for further testing under CAA section 211(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The F/FA grouping system is expected to provide a number of benefits to the F/FA manufacturers who are responsible
for registration while increasing the efficiency and functionality of the registration program itself. First,
the grouping system will reduce the overall costs of the registration program by avoiding the generation and submission
of essentially redundant information by individual manufacturers with similar products. In addition, by reducing
the number of individual formulations that will be subject to testing, the grouping system is expected to ease the
pressure and demands on limited laboratory capacity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Grouping Approach and Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic conceptual framework for the grouping system is illustrated in Figure 3. First, each fuel or additive is
sorted into one of six broad ``fuel families.'' F/FAs in each fuel family are then subdivided into three ``F/FA categories.''
The categories are further subdivided into ``F/FA groups''_the ``working'' units of the grouping system. It is among
the members of the F/FA groups that cooperative evaluation and testing efforts can be pursued using designated group
representatives. This grouping system is very similar to the approach that was proposed in the NPRM, with the exception
that the original proposal has been simplified in today's rule by eliminating the separate concept of ``formulation
class.'' EPA judged that the ``formulation class'' concept could be confusing, and was not necessary for the structure
or implementation of the grouping system. The key parameters and relationships within this grouping framework are
further explained in the following sections. A summary of the grouping system is provided in Table F94&hyph;7 (see
&sect;79.56) of the accompanying regulatory text for this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generic rules for categorization and grouping are used to determine specific F/FA groups based on the raw composition
of the particular products under consideration. The first step entails the selection of the applicable fuel family
and category for the product according to the criteria discussed below. Rules specific to the categories then define
the proper F/FA group. After the group is formed and arrangements are made for cooperative testing efforts, applicable
criteria will be applied to select a representative of the group to be used in group-sponsored testing. In determining
the category and group to which a fuel or fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts can be ignored
unless otherwise restricted in the definition of the particular fuel family. Impurities in fuels or fuel additives
are substances which are present through contamination, or remain naturally, after processing is completed.

1. Fuel Families
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule defines six fuel families, as follows: (1) Gasoline (containing more than 50 percent gasoline by volume),
(2) diesel (containing more than 50 percent diesel by volume; includes both diesel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 and diesel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 formulations), (3) methanol (containing at least 50 percent methanol by volume), (4) ethanol (containing at least
50 percent ethanol by volume), (5) methane (includes compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas containing
at least 50 mole percent methane), and (6) propane (i.e., liquid petroleum gas containing at least 50 percent propane
by volume). A manufacturer seeking to register a formulation which does not fit the criteria for inclusion in any of
the above fuel families shall contact EPA for guidance in classifying and testing such formulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed to establish two gasoline fuel families: unleaded and leaded. As explained previously,
EPA is not including a leaded fuel family in this final rule due to the upcoming ban of leaded F/FAs under CAA section
211(n). Thus, the unleaded fuel family has been renamed to become simply the ``gasoline'' fuel family in this final
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel families consist of a constellation of F/FA products sharing basic characteristics in regard to their chemical/physical
properties and engine/vehicle applicability. For ease of reference, the gasoline and diesel families are regarded
as the ``conventional'' fuel families, while the remaining four are referred to as the ``alternative'' fuel families.
If a manufacturer develops a F/FA product that does not meet the definition of any of the fuel families included in this
rule, EPA will define additional fuel families to include such a product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each fuel family includes not only the fuels referenced in the name of the family, but also bulk and aftermarket additives
which are intended for use in such fuels. Additives which are registered for use in more than one type of fuel are assigned
to each applicable fuel family. For example, an additive product that is registered as both a gasoline additive and
a diesel additive belongs to both the gasoline fuel family and the diesel fuel family. Furthermore, the manufacturer
of such additive product will be required to test the additive in each applicable fuel family. The multiple testing
responsibility can be satisfied by the manufacturer individually or by participating in the applicable groups for
each fuel family. For instance, if an additive product meets the baseline criteria for both gasoline and diesel, then
the product will be assigned to two groups, i.e., the gasoline baseline group and the diesel baseline group. The manufacturer
of such additive product will then be able to share the costs of testing with other manufacturers of baseline gasoline

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FAs and baseline diesel F/FAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule specifies the chemical and physical characteristics of ``base fuel'' formulations for each defined
fuel family. These are generic formulations (rather than any particular commercial fuel) with average or normative
characteristics for a given fuel family. Once an additive has been assigned to the applicable fuel family or families,
determination of the proper category and group (for each applicable fuel family) for the additive is based on the properties
of the mixture that results when the additive is mixed in the base fuel of the applicable family at the maximum concentration
recommended for use by the additive manufacturer. Moreover, it is this mixture that is used for the generation and
testing of additive emissions.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel then serve as one control (the other being a clean-air exposure group)
against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture are to be compared. Further discussion on the
definition and use of base fuels is presented in Section V.

2. F/FA Categories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fuel families are subdivided into three F/FA categories: ``baseline,'' ``non-baseline,'' and ``atypical.'' The
baseline category consists of fuels and associated fuel additives which resemble the respective base fuel for a particular
fuel family in terms of elemental composition and which conform with certain quantitative limits for particular
constituents. It is important to understand that a baseline category is not limited to base fuels; the baseline category
and group criteria defined below for each fuel family are considerably less restrictive than the respective base
fuel definitions (specified in Section V). Non- baseline F/FAs contain no chemical elements other than those allowed
in the baseline category, but they exceed the allowable baseline limit for certain constituents for the respective
fuel family. The atypical category consists, in general, of F/FAs that contain chemical elements in addition to those
allowed in the baseline category. (In a few circumstances, the atypical category also includes F/FAs that exceed
specified baseline limits for certain constituents, as discussed below.) As mentioned above, the category determination
for fuel additives is based on the properties of the mixture which results when the additive is mixed in the appropriate
base fuel at the maximum concentration recommended for use by the additive manufacturer. If the fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture contains both non-baseline and atypical constituents, the formulation is characterized as atypical.
Thus, atypical constituents take precedence over non-baseline constituents.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing the F/FA categories (and the groups within them), EPA has sought to avoid overly narrow definitions
which would result in unnecessary and duplicative testing by manufacturers, as well as overly broad definitions
which would cause potentially important toxicologic differences between F/FAs to be obscured. A basic guideline
EPA has used to find the proper balance between these two unsatisfactory scenarios is to ask whether the emissions
of a single group representative (i.e., test substance) can reasonably be expected to reflect the chemical and toxicologic
properties of the emissions of the F/FAs proposed to be classified together. In applying this guideline, EPA has kept
in mind both the homogenizing effect of combustion processes, as well as the need in some cases to examine the effects
of evaporative emissions, which generally retain the characteristics of the raw F/FA to a greater degree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These considerations have led EPA to depend on the chemical elements in F/FA formulations as a primary criterion for
categorization and grouping. Another key criterion is the presence of significant amounts (by volume, weight, or
potential potency) of F/FA constituents that are likely to change the characteristics of the combustion or evaporative
emissions in substantive ways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the baseline category in each fuel family is generally comprised of F/FAs containing no elements in
addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 These elements are the fundamental chemical building blocks of all of the fuel families defined in this rule. Omitting
any of these elements from the list of permissible baseline elements would eliminate all or most 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FAs from the baseline categories. On the other hand, allowing additional elements in the baseline definition would
introduce substances not characteristic of most 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products in the fuel family. If a group representative (test substance) did not contain the additional element,
it could not reasonably be assumed to reflect the presence and activity of F/FAs that do contain the element. Conversely,
if the group representative did contain the additional element, then the results of the testing would be influenced
by the presence and activity of this element, and would therefore not be valid for the large majority of the baseline
F/FAs. Thus, allowing F/FAs with additional elements to be included in the baseline categories (and groups) would
violate the principles of the grouping system and the objectives of the testing program.

The exceptions to this generalization (discussed in later sections) are small amounts of chlorine permitted in baseline
methanol F/FAs, and small amounts of chlorine and copper permitted in baseline ethanol F/FAs. Also, trace contamination
with elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur do not cause F/FAs to be eliminated from baseline
categories or groups.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FA formulations containing elements in addition to those allowed in the baseline category of a fuel family are classified
in the atypical category for that family. As described further below, such F/FAs are then subdivided into groups based
primarily on which atypical element(s) they contain. Moreover, the rules for choosing representatives of these
atypical groups emphasize the atypical constituent(s). This approach assures separate testing of F/FA products
with unique compositional characteristics that can reasonably be expected to appear in the emissions and may thus
have distinct emissions-based toxicologic effects. EPA believes that this approach best effectuates CAA section
211(e) by avoiding duplicative testing of similar F/FA products while requiring ``each'' F/FA to be tested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between the baseline category and the atypical category in each fuel family is the non-baseline category. Broad generalizations
about the non-baseline F/FA categories are somewhat more difficult to make, since they are distinguished from the
respective baseline categories by various attributes other than elemental composition. In the case of gasoline
and diesel F/FAs, the distinction is based primarily on the presence of significant concentrations of oxygenating
compounds. As discussed further below, the presence of such compounds may have a large impact on F/FA emission profiles.
Classification of the oxygenated F/FAs into separate categories from the baseline F/FAs (and further subdivision
into separate groups) is necessary to assure testing of representatives that can reasonably reflect the differences
in these emission mixtures and, possibly, their health effects. Similar principles apply to the non-baseline categories
in the alternative fuel families. In the case of alcohol fuels, non-baseline F/FAs are those which have a substantial
non-alcohol and non-gasoline component in the formulation. Non-baseline propane and methane formulations are
those containing significant amounts of substances other than propane and methane, respectively. In all of these
cases, the non-baseline definitions serve to ensure that F/FAs with properties that are likely to result in significantly
different emission profiles, with possibly different toxicologic effects, are not subsumed in the baseline category.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following sections describe the criteria which determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FA categories for each fuel family. It should be noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria that define baseline F/FA products for each fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family are not meant to be fuel specifications. The baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria used for grouping purposes in this final rule consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential health implications of the composition of the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or additive/base fuel mixture and might differ from previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established commercial fuel specifications, such as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ASTM), the California Air Resources Board (CARB), or federal

EPA discussed in the NPRM two options (Option A and Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B) for distinguishing the baseline and non-baseline categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the gasoline fuel family (see 57 FR 13187&hyph;13188). Today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action uses Option A for the classification of gasoline products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A discussion supporting this decision is included in the ``Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Analysis of Comments for the Fuels and Fuel Additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Registration Regulations'' (available in public docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A synopsis of EPA's analysis follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major differences between the two alternative grouping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options considered by EPA in the NPRM were: (1) The cutoff point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for oxygen content to distinguish between baseline and non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline products, and (2) the approach for handling F/FAs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have received a waiver under CAA section 211(f). Under Option A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the baseline category was to be limited to F/FAs having less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5 weight percent oxygen by weight. Because the cut-off point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1.5 percent is consistent with the minimum oxygen requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reformulated gasolines, reformulated gasolines would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered baseline under Option A. Instead, gasolines with 1.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or more oxygen were to be sorted into different non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline groups depending on the oxygenated compounds they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained. In contrast, Option B used an oxygen cutoff point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.7 weight percent, based on current ``substantially similar'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria (see 56 FR 5352). F/FAs which exceeded this limit but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been granted a waiver for the excess oxygen were also to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful evaluation, EPA has selected Option A for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouping of gasolines in this final rule. In arriving at this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, EPA considered the testing and potential health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implications of both grouping options. The main purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouping system is to sort F/FAs based on the similarities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their emission components. After analyzing existing emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization data, EPA concluded that Option B did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an adequate approach for the testing of gasoline F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it does not distinguish between formulations that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have significantly different emission characteristics. EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation showed that the emissions from oxygenated gasolines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not the same as for non-oxygenated gasolines and that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furthermore, the emission profiles differ according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular oxygenated compound present in a fuel formulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences in emission species will affect the toxicological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option B was found inappropriate because it would have allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the grouping of gasolines containing significant amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different oxygenated compounds into one single group. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different compounds may have distinguishable toxic effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA selected Option A for the grouping of gasolines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule in order to adequately examine the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects of the different oxygenated compounds. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes this best effectuates the goal of CAA Section(e) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require testing of each fuel or fuel additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, gasoline formulations are defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those containing more than 50 percent gasoline by volume. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on current ``substantially similar'' criteria (see interpretative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule at 56 FR 5352), the sulfur content for all gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations in the gasoline fuel family is limited to 0.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs in the baseline gasoline category must contain no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or sulfur. Gasoline baseline formulations must possess, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of manufacture, all the physical and chemical properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an unleaded gasoline and applicable volatility class standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as specified in the latest version of ASTM standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel, D 4814. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the oxygen content of baseline gasolines must be less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5 percent by weight. The baseline gasoline category includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all gasoline fuels and additives (evaluated as additive/base fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixtures) meeting the above criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-baseline gasoline category is comprised of F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which conform to the baseline specifications in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elemental composition, but exceed the specified baseline oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit. Thus, this category includes gasoline formulations with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or sulfur, which have been blended with oxygenates (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol, ether, ester, furan, and any other compound used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation), such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the total oxygen content of the gasoline-oxygenate blend is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 1.5 weight percent. Included in the non-baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline category are reformulated gasolines and oxygenated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasolines with at least 1.5 percent oxygen (by weight), including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a number of formulations which have previously been granted CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(f) waivers on oxygen content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The atypical category in the gasoline fuel family includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs which contain elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. (Trace contamination by other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements does not cause a F/FA to be classified as atypical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The baseline gasoline group is restricted to formulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are derived from conventional petroleum sources. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasolines derived from synthetic crude oils are excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline category. Synthetic crude oils can be prepared from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coal, shale and tar sands, heavy oil deposits, and other non-conventional petroleum sources. Compared to petroleum,
these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synthetic crude oils must be extensively upgraded before they can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be refined into useful products. Because of the nature of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, these synthetic products are likely to contain a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of unknown contaminants with unknown health effects. With little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific data currently available on their composition, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that separate non-baseline classifications are most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for grouping these products. Gasoline formulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from a particular synthetic crude oil source (e.g., coal) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be permitted to group together. The representative of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such group will be the first such product to seek registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Diesel. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Diesel formulations are defined as those containing more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 50 percent diesel by volume. The sulfur content for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel formulations in the diesel fuel family is limited to 0.05 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by weight, based on current EPA limits (55 FR 34120). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diesel fuel family includes both diesel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 formulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As originally proposed, the diesel baseline category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes diesel formulations containing no elements in addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. Baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel formulations must also possess, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture, all the physical and chemical properties of a diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel as specified in the latest version of ASTM standard D 975. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oxygen content of baseline diesel formulations must be less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.0 percent by weight. The baseline diesel category includes all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuels that meet the above criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diesel baseline definition is consistent with existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in EPA's F/FA registration data base, which indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that most commercial diesel fuels, including their bulk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives, consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfur. While some currently registered diesel fuels contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives with additional elements, the objectives of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program are inconsistent with broadening the diesel baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition to include other elements with potentially different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects from those of basic diesel formulations. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broader baseline definition would mean that the atypical diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs would not be separately examined. Limiting baseline diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs to those containing no elements in addition to carbon, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur ensures the conduct of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate health effects evaluations for the emissions of diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations containing atypical elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to baseline gasoline, the baseline diesel category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excludes fuels derived from synthetic crude oil sources. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such formulations are included in the non-baseline category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the diesel family. The non-baseline diesel category also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes diesel formulations with 1.0 percent or more oxygen by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight. Examples of non-baseline diesel formulations are alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blends and biodiesel formulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methanol. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs in the methanol fuel family are defined as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing at least 50 percent methanol by volume. The baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methanol category is comprised of methanol and methanol-gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs that: (1) Contain at least 50 percent methanol by volume, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) contain no more than 4 percent by volume of substances other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than methanol and gasoline, and (3) contain no elements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorine. The sulfur content of baseline methanol formulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is limited to 0.004 percent by weight. Chlorine (as chloride) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to no more than 0.0001 percent by weight. Chlorine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed in methanol baseline formulations because it is a common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant remaining from methanol production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The baseline methanol category includes all methanol fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the above criteria and is divided into two groups: M100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group and M85 group. The M100 group includes methanol-gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations containing at least 96 percent methanol by volume, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while the M85 group consists of methanol formulations containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50&hyph;95 percent methanol by volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs within the baseline M100 group are required to contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
odorants and bitterants. These formulations should have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinctive and noxious taste, for purposes of preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposeful or inadvertent human consumption. The elemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition of the odorant and bitterant is limited to carbon, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine. Baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methanol formulations in the M85 group must comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elemental composition specified above for all baseline methanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs, but need not have added odorants and bitterants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-baseline methanol category is comprised of methanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations (i.e., containing at least 50 percent methanol by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume) that meet the baseline limits on elemental composition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but contain more than 4 percent by volume of substances other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than methanol and gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atypical methanol F/FAs contain elements in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those allowed in the baseline methanol category or exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified limits for sulfur or chlorine.

Ethanol. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ethanol formulations in the ethanol fuel family are defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as those containing at least 50 percent ethanol by volume. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule defines a single group (represented by E85) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline category of ethanol F/FAs. Although in the NPRM, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed two baseline groups for the ethanol fuel family (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E100 and E85), EPA expressed its intention to establish a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group for baseline ethanol formulations in the Reopening Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, the rationale behind this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision is that fuel ethanol is required to contain at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five percent denaturant, which means that, in actuality, E100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations contain only 95 percent ethanol (i.e., E95). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, gasoline is normally used as the denaturant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethanol fuels. EPA judged that there was little incremental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value in requiring tests of E95 in addition to E85. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule creates a single baseline ethanol group represented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E85. However, EPA retains the authority to require testing on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other members of any F/FA group under Tier 3 (see Section IX.A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The baseline ethanol category is comprised of ethanol and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethanol-gasoline F/FAs that: (1) Contain at least 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethanol by volume, (2) contain no more than 5 percent by volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of substances other than ethanol and gasoline, and (3) contain no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfur, chlorine, and/or copper. The sulfur content of ethanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline formulations is limited to 0.004 percent sulfur by mass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chlorine (as chloride) and copper are allowed in the baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethanol formulations at a maximum level of 0.0004 percent by mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for chloride and 0.07 mg/l for copper. Chlorine and copper are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted in the baseline ethanol formulations because they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common contaminants remaining from ethanol production. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline ethanol category includes all ethanol fuels meeting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-baseline ethanol category is comprised of ethanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations (i.e., containing at least 50 percent ethanol by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume) that meet the baseline limits on elemental composition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but contain more than 5 percent by volume of substances other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than ethanol and gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

mole percent methane, including both compressed natural gas (CNG) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and liquified natural gas (LNG). Baseline methane formulations

percent of non-methane hydrocarbons. Sulfur content for baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methane formulations (including additives) is limited to 16 parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per million (ppm) by volume. Methane formulations must contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added odorants with an elemental composition that satisfies the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary table of the F/FA grouping system is included in the regulations (see Table F94&hyph;7 in &sect;79.56).
In this table, the fuel families serve as column headings and the categories define the rows. The resulting combination
of fuel families and categories (i.e., the boxes in the table) contain the F/FA groups. Within each category, one or
more groups are defined according to the presence of differing constituents in the raw fuel or additive/base fuel
mixture. The number of groups in a particular F/FA category depends on the variability among the products in that category.
For example, the atypical category for each fuel family potentially consists of many groups that are defined according
to the atypical element(s) or constituent(s) specified for the particular family. Within each group, one formulation
is chosen to represent all of the member products in compliance with the registration requirements. Related costs
may be shared by participating F/FA manufacturers within each group.

Groups within the Baseline Categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The baseline category for each defined fuel family contains a single F/FA group, with the exception of the baseline
methanol category. As discussed above, the baseline methanol category includes two groups: the M100 group and the
M85 group. The representative to be used in required emission characterization and health effects tests for each
baseline group is the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family (see Section V). For example, all gasoline
formulations meeting the gasoline baseline criteria are sorted into one group, to be represented in testing by the
designated gasoline base fuel. The same holds true for diesel, ethanol, methane, and propane fuel families. In the
case of methanol, baseline formulations are divided into two groups and testing is performed on two representatives,
one for each of the designated baseline groups, i.e., M100 base fuel and M85 base fuel.

Groups within the Non-Baseline Categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-baseline categories are defined for each fuel family. F/FAs in non-baseline groups include products that comply
with the baseline elemental composition restrictions for the respective fuel family, but do not meet quantitative
limits on certain baseline components (e.g., oxygen content). Non-baseline groups are defined according to the
constituent(s) that differentiate the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture from the baseline products in the respective
fuel family. The representative for each non-baseline group is the member of the group with the highest concentration
of the non-baseline constituent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gasoline. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gasoline formulations which comply with the baseline elemental composition criteria, except that they have a total
oxygen content of 1.5 weight percent or more, are designated as non-baseline. These products are grouped according
to the specific oxygenate compound (e.g., any specific alcohol, ether, or methanol/co-solvent combination) used
to increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation. Thus, separate non-baseline groups are defined for ethanol,
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl
ether (DIPE), di-methyl ether (DME), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, EPA had proposed to define additional non-baseline groups for fuels containing combinations of oxygenate
compounds (or for which the registration contained multiple oxygenate additives), with separate groups defined
for each combination recorded in a registration. However, EPA decided not to require the testing of oxygenate combinations
in this final rule during the routine Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing program. EPA believes that the testing of fuels with individual
oxygenates will satisfy the main objectives of the program by providing basic information about the potential health
effects of particular oxygenated compounds in gasolines. Requiring routine testing of every recorded combination
was judged unreasonable, as it resulted in a number of groups that did not reflect actual formulations in use. If there
is concern about the toxicity of specific mixtures of oxygenated compounds, EPA may require additional testing under
Tier 3 on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception to this treatment of oxygenate combinations occurs in the case of non-baseline formulations containing
methanol. Existing ``substantially similar'' criteria currently limit the use of methanol as an oxygenate in gasoline
to 0.3 percent by volume (i.e., 0.1 percent by weight), unless the formulation contains appropriate alcohol co-solvents.
Thus, methanol-containing gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more must also contain a co-solvent.
Accordingly, in the grouping system, each methanol and co-solvent combination used in gasoline formulations defines
a different non-baseline group [e.g, methanol and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol
(TBA), methanol and butanol, etc.]. Those oxygenate compounds used as co-solvents for methanol need to be identified
as such in a fuel's registration. If an oxygenate is not identified as a methanol co-solvent, even if it appears in a
fuel registration that also includes methanol, then EPA will assume that it defines a gasoline/oxygenate group separate
from the methanol/gasoline mixture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within each non-baseline gasoline group, a formulation consisting of the base gasoline fuel blended with the highest
weight percent of the oxygenate or methanol/co-solvent combination registered for any member F/FA product will
serve as the group representative that will be tested to comply with the program's requirements. The selection of
the group representative is to be based on the highest actual concentration-in-use or the highest recommended concentration-in-use,
whichever is the greater, for the particular oxygenate or oxygenate/co-solvent blend.

EPA recognizes that current fuel registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in the original registration
a list of all the potential additives that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with the applicable range of concentration-in-use
for each alternative. Under these circumstances, this final rule makes the non-baseline producer responsible for
the testing of each oxygenate listed in the registration. For example, if a gasoline fuel registration lists methanol/co-solvent,
ethanol, MTBE, and ETBE, then the manufacturer is responsible for separately testing each of four gasoline/oxygenate
blends: gasoline-methanol/co-solvent, gasoline-ethanol, gasoline-MTBE, and gasoline-ETBE. The multiple testing
responsibility can be satisfied by the manufacturer individually or by participating in four applicable groups.
In each group, a formulation consisting of the base gasoline fuel blended with the highest concentration of the oxygenate
listed for any member fuel or additive/base fuel mixture would serve as the group representative to be tested to comply
with the program's requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing fuel registration procedures also allow manufacturers to report a range of concentration-in-use for
each bulk additive listed as a potential component of the registered fuel. Thus, it is possible for the same registration
to include formulations under both baseline and non-baseline definitions. If so, the manufacturer is responsible
for testing formulations in both categories covered by the indicated range listed in the registration. In other words,
if the reported range of concentration-in-use of an added oxygenate could include gasoline formulations with less
than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer
is responsible for testing formulations in both baseline and non-baseline categories. For example, suppose a gasoline
registration includes two potential oxygenates with respective concentration-in-use (shown here in terms of the
resulting oxygen content in the formulation), as follows: ethanol (0 to 3.5 percent oxygen by weight) and ETBE (0 to
2.7 percent oxygen by weight). Because the indicated ranges include both baseline and non-baseline formulations,
the manufacturer would be responsible for the testing of three formulations: baseline gasoline, a non-baseline
gasoline-ethanol blend, and a non-baseline gasoline-ETBE blend. If the manufacturer chooses to participate in
grouping arrangements, then he/she would be sharing the cost of the testing for the representative of each of these
three groups.

Diesel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-baseline diesel formulations contain at least 1.0 percent oxygen by weight. Non-baseline formulations include
alcohol blends, ether blends, biodiesels (e.g., diesel-soy methyl ester blend), and other formulations containing
oxygenating compounds. Separate non-baseline groups are defined for each added alcohol or ether (e.g., methanol,
ethanol, DME, etc.) and for other oxygenating compounds by class (e.g., peroxides, nitroso compounds, nitro compounds,
alkyl nitrites, alkyl nitrates, animal-source alkyl esters, vegetable-source alkyl esters, furans, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diesel fuel manufacturers are responsible for the testing of each added alcohol, ether, or oxygenate class included
in their fuel registration. For example, if the registration includes added methanol and soy methyl ester, the manufacturer
will be responsible for testing two non-baseline formulations: (1) A diesel-methanol blend and (2) a diesel formulation
containing a vegetable-source alkyl ester. In order to satisfy the testing requirements, the manufacturer may perform
the tests individually or take advantage of the grouping provisions to share the testing costs with other manufacturers
of similar products. In the above example, the manufacturer will be able to group with other manufacturers of diesel
formulations containing methanol and with other manufacturers of formulations containing other vegetable-source
alkyl esters (e.g., rape methyl ester). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each diesel non-baseline group defined by the presence of an alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenating compound,
the representative to be used in testing will be a formulation consisting of the diesel base fuel blended with the highest
actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the particular alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenating compound,
as recorded for any member of the group. For example, if manufacturers form a group of non-baseline diesel formulations
containing vegetable-source alkyl esters, the group representative will be a diesel formulation containing the
highest volume percent of any of the vegetable-source alkyl esters represented in the group. The alkyl ester is to
be added to the base diesel fuel for conducting the required emission characterization and toxicity tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that current registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in the original diesel fuel
registration a list of all the potential oxygenating compounds that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with
the applicable range of concentration-in-use for each alternative. As with gasoline formulations, this final rule
requires the diesel fuel producer to test each alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenate listed in the registration. Also,
if a registration lists a range of oxygen content that defines both baseline and non-baseline formulations, then
the manufacturer is required to test both a baseline formulation and a non-baseline formulation.

 Non-baseline methanol formulations conform with the baseline limits in terms of elemental composition, but contain
more than 4 percent by volume of substances other than methanol and gasoline. Individual groups are defined for each
non-methanol, non-gasoline component, and for each unique combination of such components. The representative
of each non-baseline methanol group will be the group member with the highest concentration (i.e., percent by volume)
of the non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s).

 Non-baseline ethanol formulations conform with the baseline limits in terms of elemental composition, but contain

non-ethanol, non-gasoline component, and for each unique combination of such components. The representative of
each non-baseline ethanol group will be the group member with the highest concentration (i.e., percent by volume)
of the non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s).

 There is only one non-baseline methane group. This group contains all methane formulations conforming with the baseline
criteria except that they exceed the allowable limit for non-methane hydrocarbons (i.e., 20 mole percent). The representative

hydrocarbons.

Groups within the Atypical Categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Atypical groups within each fuel family are defined according to the distinctive atypical constituent(s). Separate
groups are established for any single atypical constituent and any unique combination of atypical constituent(s)
which occurs among the products in each category. For example, if a gasoline fuel contains sodium, and no other atypical
element, then this atypical fuel will group with other gasoline fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures containing
sodium as their only atypical constituent. However, if a gasoline fuel contains sodium and potassium, then this fuel
will define a separate group for formulations containing both sodium and potassium. As explained previously, EPA
believes that this approach is reasonable because different atypical elements may have distinct toxicological
effects. Thus, while similarly composed F/FAs may group together, EPA believes that testing distinct F/FAs separately
best effectuates CAA Section 211(e), which states that ``each'' F/FA shall be tested.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Groups are further subdivided according to the presence of polymers containing atypical element(s) in their molecular
structure. F/FAs containing polymers are considered atypical for a respective fuel family only if the F/FA product
as a whole contains one or more atypical elements. If the polymer contains an atypical element as part of its molecular
structure, then the atypical polymer defines a separate atypical group. For example, the presence of polyethylene
in a gasoline product does not in itself make that product atypical because polyethylene contains no elements in addition
to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. On the other hand, if the gasoline product contains chlorinated
polyethylene, then the product is considered atypical because of the chlorine content (chlorine is an atypical element
for the gasoline fuel family). Such product could group with other atypical gasoline products containing chlorinated
polymers. However, if the atypical gasoline product contains polyethylene and chlorine as two different components
of the formulation, the product will group with other atypical gasoline products containing chlorine in non-polymer
constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For groups defined by a single atypical constituent, the representative to be used in satisfying the group's testing
requirements will be the member fuel or additive/base fuel mixture with the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use
of the atypical constituent. Within a group of such products containing a unique combination of two or more atypical
elements, the representative shall be the product which has the highest total concentration of atypical elements.
In the case that two or more products within such a group contain the same and highest concentration of atypical constituents,
the process specified for selecting the representative gives precedence to the highest total concentration of the
atypical constituents in the following priority order: (1) Total concentration of metals, (2) total concentration
of halogens, (3) total concentration of other atypical elements (including sulfur, if applicable), (4) total concentration
of polymers containing atypical elements, (5) total concentration of oxygen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously, current fuel registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in their registration
a list of potential bulk additives to be used in the fuel. As a result, registrations could include several additives
containing one or more atypical constituents with the same purpose-in-use, but which are not intended by the fuel
manufacturer to be used at the same time. If several additives for the same purpose-in-use are listed in a single registration,
and if these additives contain different atypical elements, the manufacturer is responsible for testing each individual
atypical additive separately. This means that each unique atypical additive listed in a registration for the same
purpose-in-use will define a different testing group. On the other hand, if a fuel registration includes additives
with different functions and different atypical elements, and if these additives are normally blended together
in the same formulation, then the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is allowed to test them together (or to participate in an applicable group). For example, if a diesel fuel registration
lists two atypical biocide additives, one containing boron and the other containing chlorine, the fuel manufacturer
would then be responsible for testing two formulations (one diesel formulation containing boron and one diesel formulation
containing chlorine). However, if the registration includes a boron-containing biocide and a chlorine-containing
detergent, then the manufacturer may test the two additives together.

C. Implementation of Grouping System and Cost-Sharing Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grouping system included in this final rule allows manufacturers of similar F/FAs, on a voluntary basis, to pool
their resources and efforts to satisfy the registration requirements. The primary objectives of the grouping system
and cost-sharing provisions are to reduce the overall costs of the registration program and maximize the efficiency
of the program by avoiding duplication of effort. The grouping and cost-sharing provisions included in today's rule
are supported by CAA section 211(e)(3)(B), which permits manufacturers of similar F/FAs to share the testing costs
of the program so that requirements can be met without duplication. Although this rule allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers to comply with the program's requirements by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues
to be individually subject to this rule and responsible for testing under this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practical implementation of the grouping system involves two major tasks: (1) The organization and administration
of group functions, and (2) the development of equitable arrangements for cost-sharing. Backed by its experience
with respect to the TSCA testing program, EPA judges that the F/FA industry, under the aegis of its various trade associations
or other third parties, is capable of accomplishing these tasks with little or no Agency assistance and interference.
EPA's experience with cost-shared testing under TSCA regulations (40 CFR part 791) indicates that manufacturers
prefer to work out their own cost-sharing arrangements, and EPA anticipates that F/FA registration applicants will
likewise prefer to work out their own cost-sharing agreements. Public comments from the regulated industry support
this assumption. Thus, EPA intends for manufacturers to work out cost-sharing agreements by themselves. However,
if F/FA manufacturers cannot work out cost reimbursement, this rule allows F/FA manufacturers to use procedures
similar to existing TSCA procedures [see &sect;79.56(c) of this rule] for resolution of disputes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to establishing cost-sharing mechanisms, F/FA manufacturers will also need to develop agreements concerning
the division of responsibilities among group members for meeting the specific requirements of the registration
program. EPA expects the participation of industry trade associations in the formation of groups and management
of these activities. These associations should be able to establish ``third-party'' mechanisms whereby individual
manufacturers can enroll their products in appropriate groups while minimizing the extent to which confidential
data must be revealed. Each manufacturer needs to determine whether the grouping and cost-sharing advantages outweigh
the possible competitive risks involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, F/FA manufacturers should be able to determine the appropriate groups for their products without EPA
involvement, according to the grouping criteria specified in this final rule, and to enroll their products into those
groups. However, EPA recognizes that some Agency involvement might be needed in some special cases. When appropriate,
based on EPA's discretion, the Agency will provide limited guidance for those manufacturers needing assistance
with the application of the grouping criteria to their specific products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of F/FAs registered prior to the effective date of this rule are required to notify EPA within six months
after the effective date of this rule if they intend to comply with the rule as part of a group and, if so, to identify the
person or entity which is organizing the testing (see Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
XII.A). In this case, groups of producers would organize prospectively to complete the same program requirements
for their similar products and cost-sharing arrangements could be reached in advance of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of F/FAs not registered prior to the effective date of this rule are expected to conduct the required
testing individually, unless they certify to EPA that they intend to rely on data to be submitted (and/or previously
submitted) by an existing group or individual manufacturer of a similar registered product. The certification needs
to include assurances that the original submitter has been notified (see Section XII.A for notification requirements)
and that the manufacturer intends to comply with reimbursement as provided in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the reimbursement provisions in this rule, there will be a fifteen years ``reimbursement period'' for the original
submitter (individual or group) to obtain reimbursement from those manufacturers that rely on previously submitted
data. This period has been lengthened from the originally proposed five years in response to public comments.

V. Base Fuel Specifications and Formulation Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final rule, EPA is establishing chemical and physical specifications to represent base fuel formulations
for each defined fuel family. EPA has adopted the method proposed in the reformulated gasoline rulemaking (56 FR 31176),
which uses sales-weighted averages of fuel survey data to determine national average chemical and physical parameters,
to establish base fuel specifications for gasoline and diesel. Because comparable survey data are not available
for alternative fuels, the base fuels for the alternative fuel families are based on CARB definitions and limited
survey information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generic base fuel formulations will function as archetypes of the F/FAs in each fuel family and will serve as the
test substance or group representatives for the baseline group(s) for the respective fuel family. The use of consistently
formulated base fuels will facilitate the comparison of the emission and health effect test results from the many
fuel and fuel additive products within each fuel family. The base fuels will also serve as the fuel substrates into
which additives undergoing evaluation will be mixed prior to emission generation and testing. Tests conducted on
the emissions of the base fuel will then serve as controls against which tests on the emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the additive/base fuel mixture will be compared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to defining chemical and physical parameters for each base fuel, EPA is also specifying the allowable
additive(s) to be included in the base fuel. EPA recognizes that commercial fuels typically contain additives to
control fuel quality and enhance fuel performance, as well as to help in fuel production and distribution. Ideally,
in order to better isolate the health effects associated with a particular additive or fuel, the base fuel would not
contain additives unless they were the actual test subjects. However, several bulk additive types are common to most
of the fuels within a given fuel family, and these should arguably be included as part of the base fuel. As a practical
matter, it would be difficult in some instances to find a fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that did not contain certain additive types used by refiners to facilitate production or distribution. EPA is thus
requiring that base fuels contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production
or distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation
and emission generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods required under this rule. Since additives may have a substantial effect on emissions, for purposes of standardization
it is important to specify the additive types which are to be contained in the base fuels. However, the selection of
the specific product within each specified additive functional category is left to the formulator of the base fuel
and/or the manufacturer responsible for the testing. Unless otherwise restricted, the presence of trace contaminants
does not preclude the use of a fuel or fuel additive as a component of a base fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additive requirements for each defined base fuel are discussed in the following sections. Additives used as base
fuel components are to be added at the minimum treatment rate needed for effective performance. In contrast, additives
to be tested must be mixed in the base fuel at the maximum in-use concentration recommended by their manufacturers.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 When a fuel additive is tested, any additive normally contained in the base fuel which serves the same function as the
test subject additive must be removed from the base fuel formulation. For example, if a corrosion inhibitor is to be
tested, this test additive would replace the corrosion inhibitor normally included as a component in the base fuel.
This substitution requirement may preclude the use of certain multi-functional additives as base fuel components
(in the case where the subject additive serves one of the functions of the multi-functional additive), since it would
not be possible to replace a portion of a multi-functional additive with the test subject additive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the gasoline base fuel, EPA is requiring the use of the reformulated gasoline summer baseline fuel as specified
in CAA Section 211(k)(10)(B)(i). This unleaded gasoline fuel, which is free of oxygenates, was determined from fuel
survey data and will be used to represent all grades of conventional gasoline. This base fuel has the same specifications
as the industry average gasoline used in many recent fuel emission studies, including the Auto/Oil Program
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 and EPA's reformulated gasoline testing program. Selecting this formulation as the base gasoline fuel allows the
comparison of emission characterization results from the F/FA testing program with a larger body of current emission
data. The blending tolerances for the gasoline base fuel are consistent with certain blending tolerances specified
in the RFG rule (59 FR 7716).

The gasoline base fuel must contain the following additives: deposit control, corrosion inhibitor, demulsifier,
anti-oxidant, and metal deactivator. In addition to the above required additives, the final rule allows manufacturers
to use anti-static additives in the gasoline base fuel, if needed. Anti-static additives are not required in gasoline
base fuel because this type of additives is not considered essential for the fuel's production, distribution, or
the vehicle operation. Thus, anti-static additives should be used only as a safety measure on a case-by-case basis,
as needed (e.g., when static problems present a risk of explosion). The required and permissible gasoline base fuel
additives may contain no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed to preclude the use of sulfur-containing additives in the gasoline base fuel.
However, in response to a number of comments from the regulated industry, this final rule permits up to 15 ppm sulfur
to be included in the additives. The total sulfur content in the base fuel, including any sulfur contributed by the
additive components, must equal 339 ppm (within a tolerance of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
# 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25 ppm). A summary of the gasoline base fuel specifications and its additive components is provided in the accompanying
regulations [see Table F94&hyph;1 in &sect;79.55(b)].

2 diesel is selected in this final rule as the base fuel for diesel. The specifications for the diesel base fuel were
determined by calculating an industry average diesel fuel from 1990 industry and government diesel fuel survey data.
The sources of data and methods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations are contained in the docket for this rulemaking.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The blending tolerances for the diesel base fuel have been set to be comparable to those used in the gasoline base fuel.
An exception to this general methodology is the base fuel specification for sulfur level. The required sulfur level
(0.05 weight percent) reflects current on-road diesel fuel sulfur limits (55 FR 34120).

The additives required as diesel base fuel components are: corrosion inhibitor, demulsifier, anti-oxidant, and
metal deactivator. In addition to the above required additives, the final rule allows the use of anti-static and flow
improver additives in the diesel base fuel, as needed. As with gasoline, anti-static additives are not required because
they should only be used in the case of static accumulation problems. Similarly, flow improvers may be used on a need
basis to improve cold weather handling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the gasoline base fuel, the diesel base fuel additives may contain sulfur, as well as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen. The total sulfur content in the diesel base fuel formulation, including any sulfur contributed by the
additives, may not exceed 0.05 percent by weight. A summary of the diesel base fuel specifications and allowed additive
components is provided in the regulatory text [see Table F94&hyph;2 in &sect;79.55(c)].

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has used CARB definitions and other available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to establish base fuel specifications for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative fuel family (see Tables F94&hyph;3_F94&hyph;6 in &sect;79.55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, due to rapidly developing technology, the fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
package requirements for these fuels are not as well established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as for gasoline and diesel. In fact, there is only limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information available on the additive requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful long-term operation of each alternative fuel/vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination. Hence, it is the responsibility of the F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers who are required to test such base fuels (in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with EPA), to comply with the additive requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the manufacturer of the particular vehicle/engine used for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of alternative F/FAs. If the manufacturer of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatively-fueled vehicle or engine specifies that additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(beyond those specified in the regulations), are essential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, then the F/FA manufacturer should submit a request to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to use those additional additives as components of the base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel at the minimal effective level. EPA will publish a document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Methanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methanol fuel family contains two fuel groups, one for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M100 fuels and one for M85 fuels. Each of these methanol groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has its own base fuel. These base fuels may only contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorine. The chlorine (as chloride) is permitted as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant remaining from methanol production, and is limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no more than 0.0001 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 0.002 percent by mass in the base M100 fuel and may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 0.004 percent by mass in the base M85 fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The M100 base fuel must consist of 100 percent chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grade methanol by volume. The M85 base fuel is to contain 85 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent chemical grade methanol by volume, blended with 15 volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent base gasoline fuel (meeting the gasoline base fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications outlined in Section V.A., above). Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the methanol base fuels are listed in Table F94&hyph;3 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.55(d) of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some gasoline detergents have been shown to cause intake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system deposits when used in M85 applications. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lubricating oils containing calcium have been shown to cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injector tip deposits in M100 applications. Therefore, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends that F/FA manufacturers determine the methanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compatibility of lubricating oils as well as fuel additives used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the gasoline portion of the M85 base fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ethanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ethanol fuel family contains one group, represented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E85 base fuel. The E85 base fuel is to contain 85 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical grade ethanol by volume, blended with 15 volume percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base gasoline. The ethanol base fuel may only contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and copper. The chlorine (as chloride) is permitted as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant remaining from ethanol production, and is limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no more than 0.0004 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 0.004 percent by mass. Copper, also a contaminant from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethanol production, is limited to 0.07 mg/L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additives used in the gasoline component of E85 base fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be ethanol-compatible. The base fuel specifications for E85 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are summarized in Table F94&hyph;4 in &sect;79.55(e) of the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Methane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methane fuel family is represented by a natural gas base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel whose specifications are within the proposed ranges for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural gas certification fuel (as proposed in 57 FR 52912). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This base fuel may only contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, with the sulfur limited to 16 parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per million (by volume). The methane base fuel must contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added odorant for leak detection purposes, used at a level such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that at ambient conditions the fuel has a distinctive odor potent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flammability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed that any sulfur in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methane base fuel be limited to that contained in the odorant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive. In response to public comment, this restriction has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been removed; however, the total sulfur in the methane base fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation, including that contributed by any additives, may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 16 parts per million. The methane base fuel specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed in Table F94&hyph;5 in &sect;79.55(f) of the accompanying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Propane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The propane fuel family is represented by a commercial LPG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base fuel. The propane base fuel may only contain the elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, with the sulfur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to 123 ppm (by weight). The propane base fuel must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain added odorant, for leak detection purposes, at a level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such that at ambient conditions the fuel has a distinctive odor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit of flammability. As in the case of the methane base fuel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule does not require the sulfur in the formulation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be contained only in the odorant additive. Rather, the sulfur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation applies to the fuel/additive mixture in combination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The propane base fuel specifications are listed in Table F94&hyph;6 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VI. Emission Generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the registration requirements, F/FA manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are required to conduct a detailed characterization of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion and evaporative emissions of their products, as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as biological tests in which animals are exposed to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. The next sections describe the methods specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule for generating the emissions to be used in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical and biological tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed in the NPRM, combustion emissions are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated using applicable portions of the FTP.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 To control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of the inherent variability of FTP emissions generated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient engine operation,
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 this final rule requires the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a mixing chamber or other apparatus (see Section VI.B.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is one of the approaches discussed for consideration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reopening Notice. EPA is permitting the use of either the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamometer or the chassis dynamometer for emission generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during biological testing using FTP or FTP-equivalent cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to require the use of non-catalyzed emissions (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
untreated exhaust emissions)
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 for biological testing in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assure that the test animals are exposed to the full range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission species potentially resulting from the combustion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs. A brief summary of the rationale behind this decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

It is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this

program is not to test the effectiveness of emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices or to directly evaluate the emission performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various vehicles and engines. Rather, it is to examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential toxicologic effects of the emissions produced by F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in use. With modern emission control technology in place, most

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust come from two sources: Malfunctioning vehicles (``high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitters'') and normal vehicles during their cold start period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when their engines run rich and their catalytic converters have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not yet reached effective operating temperatures. The variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from these two important sources are not well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented by hot, catalyzed exhaust generated from well-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained, modern vehicles. Emissions during the cold-start 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include hundreds of organic chemical species which are generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the catalytic converter reaches its effective temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the catalytic converter is warmed-up, its efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases to the point where only a dozen or so simple compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in readily measurable amounts in the catalyzed exhaust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the use of catalyzed exhaust in the biological testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program would exclude from the tests relevant emission species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could potentially be harmful to human health or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. In fact, laboratory animals would be exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only very few of the organic emission species associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion of the fuel or additive of interest. In contrast, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambient air normally contains the full range of combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, since cold-start emissions are continuously reintroduced and some ``high emitters'' are always in operation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since humans experience long-term exposure to these emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it is important that they be included in the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure atmosphere. EPA's analysis
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 of non-catalyzed emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data demonstrates that emissions that receive no aftertreatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent a comprehensive aggregate of characteristic combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products at enriched concentrations, including the species which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may otherwise be emitted only during the cold start or by high-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitting vehicles. In order to simulate emissions that include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full range of potential species produced in the combustion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs, EPA is requiring the use of non-catalyzed emissions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological testing in this program.

With the exception of exhaust after-treatment devices, this

final rule requires that all normally required emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment be present and fully operational on all test vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and heavy-duty engines used in the generation of non-catalyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. In order to maintain the appropriate operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust system while obtaining non-catalyzed emissions, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the use of non-functional aftertreatment devices (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a blank catalyst with no catalytic wash coat) in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulate the back pressure, residence time, and mixing

aftertreatment devices. Special emission generation allowances

for the testing of specific additives which are introduced for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in conjunction with certain aftertreatment devices are

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers are required under Tier 1 to characterize the

combustion emissions of their F/FAs. Depending on the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family in question, vapor-phase, semi-volatile, and particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions may be required to be characterized.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section VII.B., the emission characterization requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the measurement of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nitrogen, particulates, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers,

As discussed earlier, this final rule allows the use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine for emission generation using FTP procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of F/FAs normally used in light-duty vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications, if an engine is to be used, the appropriate speed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus torque trace for the UDDS must be determined in a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a chassis dynamometer prior to emission generation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine used for emission generation in this testing program must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then be operated under specific speed and torque conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulate the UDDS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light-duty vehicle testing, vapor phase emission samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are to be collected for each segment of the FTP cycle (i.e., Bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, Bag 2, and Bag 3). In addition, a semi-volatile sample and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate sample are to be collected during the driving cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for light-duty vehicles. The heavy-duty testing procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes two tests: a cold-start test and a hot-start test. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three emission phases (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate) are to be collected for each heavy-duty test. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications to the standard FTP may be required for collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of semi-volatile and particulate emissions, which are required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for emission characterization and in-vitro biological testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see next section). Special procedures may also be necessary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to characterize emissions from F/FAs containing atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements. Good engineering and analytical chemistry practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be followed while modifying the applicable test cycle for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of fractions not specified in 40 CFR part 86. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such modifications must be described in detail in the discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of emission generation procedures to be included in the report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to EPA, as discussed in Section XII.B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vapor-phase emissions are to be collected and stored in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tedlar bags for subsequent chemical analysis. These emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be stored for only a limited period of time before chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes may occur. The critical time period is a function of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition of the emissions, storage temperature and pressure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of storage container, exposure to ultraviolet light, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of deterioration that is considered acceptable. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum allowable storage times for emissions which are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjected to chemical analysis will vary depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speciation protocol, and are identified in relevant parts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory text.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The particulate fraction may be collected on a single filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead of on multiple filters as prescribed in the FTP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the filter collection procedures outlined in the CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were designed for heavy-duty emission testing, these methods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable and can be used in light-duty applications as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, semi-volatile phase emissions are to be collected on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one apparatus for the entire driving cycle. Semi-volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are collected immediately downstream from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate collection filters using porous polymer beds or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment designed for their capture.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 After collection, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soluble organic fractions of the particulate and semi-volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are to be separately extracted using appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory procedures.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 Because the extracted materials are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much more stable than gaseous combustion emissions, they can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored up to six months if protected from ultraviolet light and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained at or below ^20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. Particulate phase emissions can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored either on the collection filter or after extraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Semi-volatile phase emissions must be extracted immediately after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection. The duration of the collection process which will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to obtain sufficient quantities of the test substance will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, and on the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the biological test protocol. If an insufficient amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate or semi-volatile material is obtained during a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driving cycle, the FTP may be repeated as required and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extracted organic fractions combined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Non-catalyzed emissions are to be generated for conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological tests, following the same procedures described above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for emission characterization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In vitro 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
biological testing (i.e., the Salmonella assay) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be conducted on extracts of the particulate and semi-volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission phases separately. Particulate and semi-volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are to be collected in a manner identical to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure used for particulate and semi-volatile emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
biological testing requires the generation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole untreated emissions for a minimum of six hours per day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five days per week, for 13 weeks. To generate these emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light-duty vehicles (or engines) with non-functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after treatment devices (e.g., blank catalyst with no catalytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wash coat) are to be operated under FTP or FTP-equivalent engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The continuous generation of emissions throughout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required exposure period requires light-duty vehicles/engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be driven through repeated UDDS cycles and heavy-duty engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be operated over repeated EDS cycles. If desired, registrants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may automate their emission generation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA was concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the inherent variability of FTP-generated emissions. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the FTP transient cycle within the biological testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, this rule requires the use of an apparatus to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more stable exposure environment for biological testing. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this purpose, EPA recommends the development and use of a large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution/mixing/integration chamber located between the constant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume sampling (CVS) system and the final dilution apparatus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just prior to the exposure chamber containing the test animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mixing chamber will allow the necessary adjustment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust concentrations and integration of the large concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swings typical of FTP exhaust, prior to exposing the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals. This chamber must meet certain performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications based on the average concentration of total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbons in the exhaust. That is, the average concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of total hydrocarbons leaving the mixing chamber must be within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ten percent of the average concentration of total hydrocarbons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering the chamber. Much of the CVS system concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability is associated with the rapidly changing dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratios that result from rapidly changing exhaust flow rates. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that vehicle exhaust sampling devices, such as mini- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diluters,
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 are being developed to maintain constant dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratios during transient testing. These systems will eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much of the concentration variability of classical CVS exhaust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, these systems are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under development and their use at this time is limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, today's rule will allow their use if they can meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance specifications defined above as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the testing program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The combustion emissions generated for animal testing are to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be diluted prior to delivery to the test animals. The CVS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, commonly used to condition exhaust for sampling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, provides for controlled ambient air dilution of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion emissions. However, water condensation can be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem during CVS system sample conditioning, depending upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle fuel consumption and fuel economy, dilution air humidity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and exhaust/diluent ratio.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 The use of pre-dried dilution air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will lower the sample humidity, thus permitting lower dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratios and higher concentration of hydrocarbons to be achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without condensation of water vapor. The minimum dilution ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will vary with fuel composition. For example, a minimum dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of about 1:5 raw exhaust (dewpoint about 125 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) with dry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clean filtered air is expected for gasoline fuels to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water concentration to a dewpoint of about 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution ratio (maximum exhaust flow rate) occurs at about 200 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seconds into the UDDS transient driving cycle. The dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio is expected to be greater for methanol, ethanol, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural gas fuels than for gasoline fuels because the exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Heated transfer ducts or tubing can be used to avoid water

condensation in much of the system, but the

dilution/mixing/integration chamber will generally be at or near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory temperature (about 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

to be adequate to assure that the cumulative integrated chamber

After initial dilution to preserve the character of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, the exhaust stream may be further diluted to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the desired biological exposure concentrations. In testing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of a particular fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer shall determine an optimum range of dilutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to characterize the health effects of the test substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The range of dilutions shall include, at a minimum, an overtly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly toxic concentration, a minimally toxic or non-toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, and a concentration of emissions having an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate level of toxicity. The selected concentrations must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the determination of a concentration-response relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see Section VIII.A.3). EPA recommends that manufacturers review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available literature for information on the design of inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies.

One important factor to consider in determining the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations or dilutions is the effect of carbon monoxide (CO) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration in test animals. The CO concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions is expected to be a limiting factor in establishing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate dilutions for the testing of F/FAs. Anoxia, among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other negative health effects from this combustion product, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mask the more subtle health effects of F/FA emissions. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends that manufacturers review available literature on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous toxicity studies for information on appropriate CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations that have been used in the exposure of laboratory

animals to automobile emissions.

3. Verification Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of mechanisms can cause emissions to be captured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dilution and sampling system before they can be characterized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or used for animal exposures. Verification testing is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the ratio (``recovery factor'') of emissions that exit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sampling system to those that enter the system. This ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be high in order for subsequent emission testing to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requires testing to verify the exposure atmosphere and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to monitor the performance of the dilution/sampling system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixing chamber, ensuring the repeatability of test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verification testing of the dilution/sampling system must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by injecting a known sample at the inlet and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring the amount that exits the sample probe. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chromatograph and flame ionization detector to estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery factor. Similar verification procedures apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification testing of the mixing chamber. Verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for the dilution/sampling system and mixing chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included in &sect;79.57(e)(2)(v) of the accompanying regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional requirements include the monitoring of conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., air flow, CO levels, etc.) in the inhalation exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber and verification of test animal exposure levels (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.61). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Evaporative Emission Generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.A.2 discusses the RVP criteria which determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicability of evaporative emission testing to specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures. Evaporative emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from in-use vehicles include diurnal, hot soak, resting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
running loss emissions, and refueling emissions. However, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplify the generation and collection procedures and to supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative emissions of sufficient concentration for biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure testing, today's rule requires that evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions be generated using an evaporative emission generator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EEG). Emissions to be used both for characterization tests and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological exposure tests are to be generated in this way. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied to cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to evaporate at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a desired rate. Manufacturers will have flexibility in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design of the EEG used to test their particular F/FA. The size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or number of EEG units to be used for evaporative emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing will depend on the rate of emissions needed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhalation study. The vapor pressure of the F/FA product may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the required tank size, as well. Emission rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control, since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission composition is sensitive to temperature changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the composition of evaporative emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles does not resemble fully-evaporated whole samples of raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels or fuel additives. This phenomenon is due to differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vapor pressure of the fuel or fuel additive components and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effects of evaporative emission control equipment. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulate this phenomenon with the EEG, procedures are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
followed to ensure that the evaporated fraction contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable representation of potential evaporated emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds. The EEG will be run at 13

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and will be equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a drain. The fuel will be drained and replenished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodically in order to maintain a constant composition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the build-up of heavier compounds in the non-evaporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion. The concentration of emissions of the evaporated fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or additive/base fuel mixture in the vapor space of the EEG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the time emissions are being withdrawn for testing shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not vary more than ten percent from the equilibrium concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vapor space of emissions generated from fresh fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive/base fuel mixture in the evaporative chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that other methods may also be suitable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generating F/FA evaporative emission mixtures for the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this program. One possible alternative method was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested in a comment received by EPA in response to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reopening Notice.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 Based on the distillation properties of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test formulation, the suggested method would involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distillation, condensation, and storage of the light-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components of the test fuel mixture, with revaporization of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole fraction to generate test atmospheres. Other alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may also be valid. To accommodate these potential alternatives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule contains a provision (see &sect;79.57(f)(5) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanying regulations) which permits manufacturers to request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for methods other than the EEG for generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative emission test atmospheres. To be granted, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests must include supporting information which demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(among other requirements) that the proposed procedures will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generate emissions reasonably similar to in-use evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission mixtures and that the generated emissions will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently concentrated to be useful in the context of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicology tests. Approved procedures will be placed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public docket.

For applicable F/FAs, evaporative emission characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements include the measurement of total volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds with speciation of the hydrocarbon compounds, alcohols, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethers, and atypical compounds. Characterization requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in Section VII.B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For biological testing, evaporative emissions will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diluted and routed to the animal chambers in a manner similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the method used for combustion emissions health effects testing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in the previous section, except that a mixing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber is not required. The rate of emission generation shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be high enough to supply the biological exposure chamber with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient emissions to allow for a minimum of fifteen air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concentration of total hydrocarbons in the evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission stream routed to the biological exposure chambers is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be diluted to three separate concentrations to establish a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of responses similar to combustion emission testing (see previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section). Evaporative emissions are not constrained by CO, NO

than combustion emissions. Verification testing is required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative emissions in a manner analogous to the verification

D. Vehicle Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is requiring that new vehicles or engines be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combustion emission generation and testing of F/FAs to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the carry-over effects from previously used fuels. All F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be tested in vehicles or engines (corresponding to chassis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or engine dynamometer testing, respectively) that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated exclusively on the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be tested.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also requiring that vehicles and engines used for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs be unaltered from original equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer (OEM) specifications (with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications in aftertreatment devices as described in Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VI.A). Rebuilds and alteration kits will only be allowed upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's approval, when a F/FA manufacturer demonstrates to EPA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OEM equipment suitable for their F/FA product's testing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unavailable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM (57 FR 13192&hyph;13193), vehicle and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine selection must follow the criteria outlined in &sect;79.57(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the accompanying regulations. The selection method is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in detail in a memorandum entitled, ``Vehicle Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures for the Proposed Fuels and Fuel Additives Rulemaking'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see Item No. II&hyph;B&hyph;6 in the public docket of this rule). As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed, the final rule does not differentiate between light-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Thus, vehicles/engines are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separated into two classes: light-duty and heavy-duty. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine selected must be a new vehicle or engine of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year in which testing begins. However, vehicle selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria are to be based on technology characteristics of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous model year. Any one of the top five selling models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(based on sales figures from the year prior to testing) with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate technology in a fuel group may be chosen. Each test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine must be equipped with all of the normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required and functioning emission control equipment, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of aftertreatment devices, when applicable (see Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VI.A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the practical constraints of the rule, EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that only one vehicle or engine model be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generate emissions for these tiers. Although EPA recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission composition is somewhat dependent on vehicle models and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may even vary in replicate tests of the same vehicle/fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination, the use of untreated exhaust in the testing program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will greatly reduce the significance of these potential sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of variability. The purpose of the testing program is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine potential health effects of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FA emissions and not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish in-use fleet average emission levels for different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of vehicles. However, EPA reserves the right to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing of F/FAs in additional vehicles or engines, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3, if there is concern for technology-based differences in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicological effects. Furthermore, EPA could require the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyzed exhaust to perform tests under Tier 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although EPA is routinely requiring only one vehicle or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine for the testing of F/FAs, EPA foresees that at least one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backup vehicle/engine of the identical model may be needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace vehicles/engines that wear out or malfunction during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of testing. The probability of needing a replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine increases in the case of testing F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing atypical elements that require additional mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation (see next section). The decision concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timing of vehicle and engine replacements is the responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the F/FA manufacturer seeking registration. EPA recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that backup vehicles/engines (if present) accumulate mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along with the primary test vehicle, so as to minimize testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interruptions if the backup vehicle/engine is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers may, at their own discretion, alternate between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backup vehicles (or engines) during testing to further decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability of problems or interruptions. Similarly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioned vehicles/engines (i.e., primary and backup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle/engine) would be expected to generate comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Emissions from backup vehicles/engines must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their emissions characterized prior to use in the biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies. Wide discrepancies between the emissions of primary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backup vehicle/engine emissions may be cause to void a test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During emission generation, vehicles and engines must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in good condition by following the OEM recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for service schedule and parts replacement. If unscheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance becomes necessary, the vehicle or engine must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired to OEM specifications, using OEM or OEM-approved parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the manufacturer is required to measure the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions (as described in Section VII.B.2.a) after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unscheduled maintenance and before resuming testing, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that the post-maintenance emissions are within 20

percent of pre-maintenance emission levels. If the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions cannot be brought within 20 percent of their previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, then the manufacturer must restart testing using a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine. Provisions in the regulations allow for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited amount of emission generation disruption without voiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the biological test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New vehicles (or engines) to be used in emission generation

for the testing of F/FAs are required to undergo a break-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period in which the vehicle (or engine) is run exclusively on the

fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to be tested. The mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation requirements of this final rule follow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches discussed in the Reopening Notice. These requirements

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vehicles to be used in the evaluation of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs are required to accumulate at least 4,000
miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to emission testing. For engines operated on an engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamometer, the minimum break-in requirement is 125 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation for testing baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. The 4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mile/125 hour mileage accumulation requirements are consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the emission stabilization procedures used in EPA's new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle certification program.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 An intact aftertreatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device must be used when accumulating mileage in the evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. Mileage can be accumulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a number of ways, i.e., on a test track, on a dynamometer, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the street, or as part of a manufacturer's fleet. No specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driving cycle is required, but it must include a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of transient operation.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For atypical F/FAs, the minimum mileage accumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required prior to testing is also 4,000 miles for test vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 125 hours for test engines. After completion of the 4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mile/125 hour minimum mileage accumulation, an attempt should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made to identify and measure the atypical element(s) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Mileage accumulation must continue until either: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 percent or more of the input mass of each atypical element is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in the emissions (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate combined), or (2) a maximum mileage accumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to 40 percent of the average useful life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable vehicle/engine (e.g., 40,000 miles for light-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles, 116,000 miles for heavy-duty vehicles, or engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent) has been reached. When either of these conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been met, emission generation can begin for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission characterization or biological testing. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of atypical species in specific emission fractions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be dependent on the nature of the particular atypical element, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends examination of all emission fractions (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate). The determination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate intervals for conducting emissions measurements is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left to the manufacturer's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of atypical F/FAs may choose to accumulate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic wash coat).
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 However, the sampling and analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions for detecting the atypical element(s) of interest, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to emission characterization or biological testing, must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done with a non-functional aftertreatment device. A brief period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of warm-up driving (i.e., 10 miles or equivalent time) needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precede the sampling for the detection of atypical element(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If the manufacturer chooses to accumulate mileage without a functional aftertreatment device, and if the manufacturer
wishes to do this outside of a laboratory/test track setting, then a memorandum of exemption for product testing must
be obtained by applying to the Director of the Field Operations and Support Division [see &sect;79.51(e)(6)(iv)
of this rule].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the mileage accumulation period for the testing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any fuel or fuel additive, vehicles and engines used for emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation must be maintained in good condition by following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended maintenance practices in the appropriate vehicle or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine owner's manual. Maintenance requirements were described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the previous section.

F. Special Requirements for Additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes provisions for the testing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific types of additives that might require modification in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission generation requirements. These include additives used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in conjunction with aftertreatment devices, additives used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrequently, and diesel additives produced exclusively for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in diesel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the above sections, EPA is requiring that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions used for Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing be generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles/engines with non-functional aftertreatment devices. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to comments received on the Reopening Notice, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is including in this final rule a special allowance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific types of additives that are designed to work in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with aftertreatment devices. In the case of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives specifically intended to enhance the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust aftertreatment devices, the related aftertreatment device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used on the emission generation vehicle/engine during all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mileage accumulation and testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding infrequently used additives, EPA recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some aftermarket additives are intended by the manufacturer (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in the additive's instructions for use) to be added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel tank only at infrequent intervals. During mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation, these types of additives may be applied according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the manufacturer's specifications. However, during emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation and testing, EPA requires that each tankful of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used contain the fuel additive at its maximum recommended level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of bulk additives used intermittently for the direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of conditioning or treating a fuel during storage or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport, or for treating or maintaining the storage, pipeline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or other component of the fuel distribution system (and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle/engine for which the fuel is ultimately intended), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also requires that the additive be added to the base fuel at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum concentration recommended by the additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer for treatment of the fuel or distribution system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component. If the manufacturer of infrequently used aftermarket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or bulk additives (as described above) is concerned that the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle/engine may be adversely affected and/or the emissions may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to artifacts due to overuse of these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification in test procedure requirements. Any such request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must include test data (e.g., emission characterization data) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the claim that procedural modification is needed, as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a suggested substitute procedure.

VII. Tier 1 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of Tier 1 encompasses: (1) a literature search for available information on the composition and effects
of F/FA emissions on public health and welfare, (2) a chemical analysis to characterize the emissions of fuels or additive/base
fuel mixtures, and (3) a qualitative discussion of potential exposures using information on total production volume
and market distribution patterns of the particular fuel(s) or additive/base fuel mixture(s).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The registration program requires
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FA manufacturers to conduct a comprehensive data search that will include all relevant existing information concerning
previous emission characterization and health effects and welfare studies. The data search must address the chemical
composition and potential adverse effects of whole combustion emissions, relevant combustion emission fractions
(e.g., particulate phase), and whole evaporative emissions, as applicable. The literature search must also address
each of the individual combustion and evaporative (where different) emission products identified by the required
emission speciation procedures, with the exception of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, benzene,
1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. Special literature search requirements for non-baseline and
atypical F/FAs are described in Section VII.A.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information considered applicable to a given fuel or additive includes data obtained from the testing of emissions
from the fuel or additive in question or from other similar products. For this purpose, ``similar'' products are those
which meet the criteria for enrollment in the same F/FA group as the subject fuel or additive, pursuant to the grouping
system criteria discussed in Section IV. F/FA manufacturers who choose to participate in the grouping system may
pool information about all member products for purposes of their joint submission and may also make use of available
data on other products which are not enrolled in the group but share the designated formulation characteristics of
group members. Similarly, a manufacturer who chooses not to participate in the grouping system could include any
test results which may be available for products which could theoretically be assigned to the same group as the manufacturer's
own product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey on health effects studies is not restricted to the particular endpoints and experimental protocols included
in Tier 2. Studies using other scientifically acceptable methods or protocols addressing all health effects of F/FA
emissions must also be included in the Tier 1 report. Most often, data will be available from experiments conducted
with laboratory animals, but other applicable studies must also be considered. Evidence for potential toxicity
or lack of toxicity in exposed humans may be available from epidemiological studies, clinical studies, occupational
exposures, or case reports. In general, referenced experiments must be concerned with the health effects of inhalation
exposure to F/FA emissions (combustion and evaporative). However, data collected from relevant studies using other
routes of exposure must also be included. Available results from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vitro 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tests, comparative metabolism studies, and structure-activity analyses are also considered relevant and must
be included in the summary report for health effects of F/FA emissions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The data search must include available literature on welfare effects, including, but not limited to, the exposure
and response of plants and animals to whole emissions and individual components of emissions, the potential for bioaccumulation,
and the concentration and persistence of emission products in the air, soil, and water. Available results of exposure
modeling analyses, environmental and atmospheric fate modeling studies, field studies, monitoring studies, accident
evaluations, or environmental simulation experiments must be included to characterize potential exposures and
the environmental impact of F/FA emissions. Specific ecological studies addressing the potential environmental
effects of F/FA emissions on vegetation, livestock, wildlife, aquatic species, and soil organisms must be included.
In addition, the data search must address the welfare effects of F/FA emissions concerning their contribution to
odor and visibility nuisances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both public and in-house available sources must be included in the literature survey. Information on the health and
environmental effects of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs is to be compiled from peer- reviewed scientific journals and other literature as well as internal industry
studies, government-sponsored reports, proceedings of scientific meetings, and other documented sources. In
general, EPA will place greater confidence in studies that have been subject to peer review. A search of appropriate
commercially available chemical, toxicological, and environmental data bases must be conducted to obtain information
from published sources. An example list of commercially available data bases that may be used to obtain information
on potential health and environmental effects, as well as environmental fate data, is available in the public docket
of this rule.

In the NPRM, EPA proposed that literature searches cover at least fifteen years. However, in response to public comments,
EPA has increased this time period to cover at least thirty years prior to the date of submission, so that important
information from earlier testing will not be omitted. In addition, literature searches must be current as of six months
prior to the beginning of testing. The thirty years are not meant to be an absolute limit for data collection. EPA encourages
F/FA manufacturers to do a comprehensive search that will include all relevant available information, regardless
of the age of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information to be submitted to EPA as a result of the data search includes the following items: (1) Brief text summary
of the general findings and conclusions, including references, (2) a printed copy of the outputs from the data base
searches, including reference list and associated abstracts, (3) complete documentation in scientific journal
format of unpublished in-house or other privately-conducted studies, and (4) tables summarizing the protocols
and results of all cited studies, organized by health or environmental endpoint and type of emissions (e.g., whole
combustion emission, individual emission product). In addition, the person(s) or contractor(s) conducting the
literature search and summary must be identified. Further discussion on the reporting requirements of this final
rule is included in Section XII.

2. Adequate Existing Information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of the literature search is to provide EPA with a comprehensive survey of the available data on
health and welfare effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs. A secondary function of the literature search is to enable F/FA manufacturers to document the extent to which
the emission characterization in Tier 1 and/or the evaluation of health effects included in Tier 2 have already been
addressed by previous adequate testing and/or analysis. If adequate testing/analysis exists, F/FA manufacturers
may submit such previous data in compliance with the requirements of the registration program. For example, if previous
emission characterization studies addressing the speciation requirements of this program are available in the
literature, then F/FA manufacturers may submit those studies in lieu of new characterization tests. Similarly,
F/FA manufacturers could use the literature search to determine the availability of adequate biological tests in
compliance with Tier 2 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To satisfy the testing requirements of Tier 1 and/or 2 with previously conducted studies, reports of such previous
tests must be sufficiently detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, experimental design,
statistical analyses, and data interpretation. Documentation must be sufficient to determine if the previously
conducted studies were performed in a manner consistent with generally accepted scientific principles, good laboratory
practices, and the specific testing guidelines in question. The age of the data will be considered but will not be the
ultimate determining factor in deciding if an existing study is adequate. Although changes in technological approaches
and methodology might preclude the use of some older studies, EPA recognizes that older literature can be useful for
the purposes of this program. Thus, the quality of the study will be the deciding factor in determining the adequacy
of existing studies, not the age per se. Additional criteria to be used in determining the adequacy of existing data/studies
in relation to Tier 2 compliance are provided in Section VIII.C.

3. Special Requirements for Non-Baseline and Atypical F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that many of the individual chemical species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will be present in the emissions of non-baseline and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical F/FAs will also be present in the emissions of baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in the same fuel family. Non-baseline formulations, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in this rule, contain the same elements as baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations. Thus, on a qualitative basis, the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products from non-baseline F/FAs are expected to overlap with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those of baseline F/FAs in the same fuel family. For atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs, the main differentiating characteristic is the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical element(s) which are not included in the baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category for a particular fuel family. The composition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions for atypical products, therefore, is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consist mainly of those species present in the emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs (for the same fuel family), with the addition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds which host the specific atypical element(s) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requiring literature data on the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and welfare effects of the whole combustion and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative (where different) emissions of the particular F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, Tier 1 also specifies that a literature search be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted on each of the emission products of the tested fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive/base fuel mixture. Because of the substantial overlap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the emission species of F/FAs in different categories within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same fuel family, however, this requirement could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant duplication of effort and waste of resources. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid this outcome, as authorized under CAA section 211(e)(3)(C), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule allows manufacturers of non-baseline and atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs to limit the literature search done for individual emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species to only those compounds which are different from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds typically present in the emissions of baseline F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the same fuel family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to take advantage of this reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, manufacturers of non-baseline or atypical F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must compare the emission characterization results of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products with emission characterization data for baseline F/FAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such data may be available from private sources, in-house 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, or from publicly available literature or data bases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, emission characterization data for baseline gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expected to be available in published literature from studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsored by the Auto/Oil Program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

for gasoline.

1. Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The chemical analysis requirements of Tier 1 satisfy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) requiring information ``to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the emissions resulting from the use of the fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive contained in such fuel.'' The characterization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions in Tier 1 will provide a useful inventory of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially harmful F/FA emission products for further study and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation in support of the F/FA testing program, risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments, and future regulatory actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FA manufacturers are responsible for the generation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection, and sampling of the combustion and, if applicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evaporative emissions of their F/FAs, and for the conduct of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests to determine the identity and concentration of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission products. In general, the required procedures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed toward the detection and measurement of selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical classes and compounds. The analyses include: (1) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of basic emissions (i.e., total hydrocarbons, carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates), (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speciation of volatile hydrocarbon compounds, aldehydes, ketones, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohols, ethers, and polycyclic aromatic compounds, and (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speciation of atypical emission products (when atypical elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are known to be present in the raw fuel or additive formulation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speciation requirements are summarized in Table 1.

2. Speciation Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section VI describes the required procedures for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation of both combustion and evaporative emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Characterization of combustion emissions must be done both for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-catalyzed emissions and for tailpipe emissions. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section III.A.2, the evaporative emissions of some F/FAs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also required to undergo emission characterization analysis. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an indication of the variability, the emissions must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated and characterized three times on three different days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collection and speciation of background samples is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA authorizes EPA to require information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize F/FA emissions, while giving EPA discretion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the particular protocols to be used for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections identify the general emission product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of interest and discuss currently available protocols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are suitable for their analyses. EPA recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific methods can be expected to advance in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the use of the protocols referenced in this final rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not mandated. Rather, EPA will hold F/FA manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountable for state-of-the-art methods and good analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemistry and laboratory practices, such as those described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the article ``Principles of Environmental Analysis.''

Today's rule does not discourage the use of any validated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method to perform the characterization of emissions, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submittal of existing speciation results obtained from validated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods, as long as the data address the speciation requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the F/FA registration program. EPA acknowledges the state-of-the-art methods of the Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement
Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program (Auto/Oil Program) for the characterization of emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, the speciation requirements included in this rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels composed primarily of hydrocarbon compounds of twelve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbons (C12) or less (e.g., gasoline) are based on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
48, 49, 50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where applicable, EPA will accept results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Auto/Oil Program as adequate data in lieu of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. However, the Auto/Oil Program might not address all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission characterization requirements of today's rule, so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional procedures (e.g., for the analysis of polycyclic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aromatic compounds) might be needed. EPA recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization data have already been submitted to EPA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to the Auto/Oil Program. F/FA manufacturers need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resubmit this information, but are required to reference these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data (e.g., report number, applicable page numbers, etc.) on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 1 report so EPA can verify the adequacy of the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being used in compliance with the F/FA registration program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the particular
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FA product or group representative. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resubmission of the raw emission data is not required, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers are still responsible for providing a summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of the emission characterization results in the Tier 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as outlined in Section XII.B.

For the characterization of diesel

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs, EPA recognizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures under the Air Pollution Research Advisory Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(APRAC) program. The work done by APRAC provides speciation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines for unregulated diesel emissions and addresses diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion compounds of concern to EPA. As with the Auto/Oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program studies, existing applicable APRAC speciation studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be considered adequate data in lieu of new testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, today's rule requires manufacturers of diesel F/FAs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform speciation procedures for hydrocarbons which might not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the APRAC program. These are discussed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following sections.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Characterization of Basic Emissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposed to require the characterization of ``regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions'' for fuel/vehicle types for which certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures existed at the time of the publication of the NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., gasoline, diesel, and methanol). Today, EPA is terming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement ``basic emissions,'' instead of ``regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions,'' because certification requirements are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established yet for all the F/FAs included in this rule. To be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent and avoid confusion, the term ``basic emissions'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for all F/FA families included in this rule. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulated emissions and taking into consideration the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives of this program, EPA selected four basic emissions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement, as follows: Total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxides of nitrogen, and particulates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four basic emissions are to be measured in combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions as a routine requirement for all F/FA families, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown in Table 1. Only total hydrocarbons are required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in evaporative emissions. Manufacturers are referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle certification procedures in 40 CFR part 86 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general guidance on the measurement of the basic emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest to this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Characterization of Hydrocarbons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As shown in Table 1, this rule requires the speciation of hydrocarbons for the vapor phase of combustion emissions
and for evaporative emissions generated using an evaporative emission generator. The speciation is to be performed
using methods that identify and determine the concentration of all hydrocarbon compounds containing twelve or fewer
carbon atoms. The Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above provide an acceptable speciation method for hydrocarbons.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Characterization of Aldehydes and Ketones.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Speciation of aldehydes and ketones containing a maximum of eight carbon atoms is required only for the vapor phase
of combustion emissions. A test procedure for formaldehyde measurement is included in 40 CFR part 86 for formaldehyde.
F/FA manufacturers are also referred to the Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above for the analysis of aldehydes
and ketones. Additional applicable procedures are available in ASTM D 5197&hyph;91, ``Standard Test Method for
Determination of Formaldehyde and Other Carbonyl Compounds in Air (Active Sampler Methodology).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Characterization of Alcohols and Ethers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alcohol and ether compounds containing six or fewer carbon atoms are to be characterized for both evaporative and
combustion emissions, whenever the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture under evaluation contains alcohols or ethers.
If a F/FA formulation contains an alcohol or ether with more than six carbon atoms, then this manufacturer is required
to measure their presence in the emissions, as well as alcohols or ethers with fewer number of carbon atoms. For example,
if an ether containing seven carbon atoms (e.g., isopropyl tertiary butyl ether) is part of a fuel formulation being
tested in this program, then its manufacturer must characterize ethers with seven or fewer carbon atoms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above, a test procedure for the characterization of alcohols
and ethers is described in 40 CFR part 80, Appendix F, entitled ``Test Method for Determination of C1&hyph;C4 Alcohols
and MTBE in Gasoline by Gas Chromatography''. This procedure can be used for the identification of ethers in addition
to MTBE, but will require appropriate modifications for application to gas phase samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Characterization of Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the NPRM, EPA proposed a broad requirement for the identification and measurement of polycyclic aromatic compounds.
In the final rule, this requirement is narrowed to a limited number of specified compounds which are of significant
concern in terms of their potential non-carcinogenic and/or carcinogenic effects. Included are specified polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (NPAH) compounds as well as individual
compounds and classes of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to specifying particular polycyclic aromatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds for analysis, the final rule reduces the families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or categories of F/FAs which are subject to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. PAH and NPAH speciation need not be done for F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the methane and propane fuel families, nor for F/FAs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical categories of other fuel families. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speciation of dioxins/furans is required only for
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain chlorine as an atypical element. This is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirement applicable to atypical F/FAs in general, that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission species containing the relevant atypical elements be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and measured (see section f, below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While EPA believes that characterization of dioxins/furans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also important in the case of baseline and non-baseline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs, the NPRM did not propose to require this procedure on a wider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. EPA has thus refrained from including mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for speciation of dioxins/furans in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline and non-baseline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs. Instead, for manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F/FAs other than chlorine-containing atypical F/FAs, dioxin/furan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization is included in the final rule only on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary basis. EPA strongly encourages manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline and non-baseline F/FAs to collect the necessary emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples and conduct these voluntary procedures at the same time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that mandatory emission characterization requirements are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfilled. The recent attention and concern about the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects of dioxins/furans, combined with the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dearth of information on the specific sources and generation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these compounds, increases the likelihood that these procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be prescribed under EPA's discretionary Tier 3 authority if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary data are not otherwise submitted on a voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. If so, the incremental costs are likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerably higher than if the procedures were conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with the standard Tier 1 emission characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was proposed, the final rule requires the measurement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speciation of polycyclic aromatic compounds in both the semi-volatile phase and particulate phase of combustion
emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, in the past, these compounds have been analyzed primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the particulate phase, the quantity of these compounds in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semi-volatile phase at the temperatures encountered in dilute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust may also be important. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Particulate and semi-volatile phase emissions are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected using methods described in Section VI.B.1. The soluble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic fraction (SOF) is to be extracted from the filter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polymer bed separately. The extracts of the two phases are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested separately for PAHs and NPAHs, but may be combined before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for dioxins/furans. Examples of protocols suitable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterizing polycyclic aromatic compounds are available in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature.

Characterization of Emissions with Atypical Elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FAs containing chemical elements other than those included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the baseline formulations for the respective fuel family are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as atypical formulations (see Section IV.B.2). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the emission characterization requirements described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, producers of atypical F/FAs are required to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure the emission products containing the associated atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element(s). For example, if a gasoline additive product contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorine, then this manufacturer must identify and measure all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission compounds that contain chlorine. Due to the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical products, special procedures for the generation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are required (see Section VI.E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presence of atypical species in specific emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fractions will be dependent on the nature of the particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical element/compound of concern. In view of this, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends that manufacturers of atypical products examine all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission fractions (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the measurement and identification of potential atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Because of the variety of potential elements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaction products involved, all of the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical/analytical procedures cannot be specified in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. The selection of the particular method(s) for measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical elements or compounds is left to the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the procedures used must be state-of-the-art and based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on sound analytical chemistry principles applicable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical element or compound of concern.

3. Quality Assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While today's rule requires emissions to be generated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterized three times as a way to evaluate the repeatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the test results, additional quality assurance procedures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to control variability during the characterization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Laboratories conducting emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization/speciation analyses are required to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification testing to examine the repeatability and accuracy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedures. For this purpose, a prepared mixture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical compounds, as appropriate for each particular procedure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be subjected to the speciation protocols. The use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical standards and controls for calibration of instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also required to assure precision and accuracy of results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reserves the right in this final rule to audit testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities involved in the generation and characterization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, as well as the health effects testing of F/FAs. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits will be organized and administered by EPA at its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense. The audit procedures could include a requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities submit a completed questionnaire in which equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and procedural information is described. EPA might make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations based on the submitted information and/or might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow up with a visit to observe the performance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocols. The audit could also include EPA distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``blind'' samples for analysis at participating laboratories (at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their expense). The audit will not have the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying that the laboratory is ``EPA approved''. Rather, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have the purpose of determining the weaknesses of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories and the acceptability of the laboratory's current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require modeling or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytic methods to evaluate potential exposures, expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric reactivity, and environmental partitioning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission products. However, as discussed in Section III.C., this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule does not require modeling analyses to be performed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine requirements under Tier 1. Instead, quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling efforts will be required on a case-by-case basis as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed under Tier 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, EPA believes that exposure data are still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical for the assessment of the potential risks associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the emissions of F/FAs in question. For this purpose, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's rule requires manufacturers to provide a qualitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of potential population exposures based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production and use of the particular fuel or additive (or group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of F/FAs) in question. This qualitative analysis must consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual and/or projected total annual production volumes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the market distribution patterns (e.g., percent of sales by state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or region) of the particular product or group of products. Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions must assess the cumulative exposure resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all members of the group. A quantitative analysis is encouraged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when appropriate data are available, including any existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling data, to support the exposure analysis. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier, EPA retains the authority to require from manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more exhaustive exposure analysis for particular products of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern under Tier 3 (including modeling), based on the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 results or other available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information.

VIII. Tier 2 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed short-term (42-day) tests under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 for the evaluation of six health effects endpoints: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity, neurotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity. EPA examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed Tier 2 program and found that similar requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the various proposed tests (in regard to animal subjects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure scenarios, and general technical principles) provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity to combine several endpoint tests within the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure protocol. In view of this, EPA has modified the Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing program to allow for concurrent test performance in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more cost-effective manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised Tier 2 testing program enhances efficiency and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility, while providing better health effects information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, the design of the Tier 2 testing program makes best use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of animals (minimum number of animals used), laboratory capacity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and financial resources. The basic Tier 2 testing framework of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule consists of a 90-day subchronic inhalation study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to examine general systemic and organ toxicity (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulmonary effects), with the addition of ancillary tests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the assessment of several specific health effect endpoints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity, and neurotoxicity) within the same exposure schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fertility assessment is coordinated with the 90-day study to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examine reproductive and teratogenic effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brief descriptions of test guidelines for the evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each health effect endpoint are provided in the sections below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of these testing guidelines are modified versions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines previously published under TSCA (40 CFR part 798, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised as of July 1, 1992) and/or the test guidelines which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanied the NPRM. Detailed protocols for the Tier 2 testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program are included in &sect;79.62&hyph;&sect;79.68 of the accompanying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Figure 4 shows a diagram of the suggested timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and organization of the Tier 2 studies within the general 90-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subchronic exposure schedule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned previously, EPA originally proposed a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that included six separate tests for the evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints of concern. Because of cost considerations, a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six-week (42-day) exposure period was proposed in the NPRM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead of the traditional 90-day test. EPA requested comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the adequacy of the proposed exposure period and exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regimen, and on the possibility of extending these tests to 90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days for comparability to historical data. Comments were also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested on the possible use of an alternative approach for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing program, the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol developed for use by the Organization for Economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooperation and Development (OECD). The standard SIDS protocol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is designed as a single-study screen (45-day) for repeat dose, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive, and developmental effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments from industry supported the 90-day test over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the proposed 42-day test or the SIDS protocol. Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concern regarding both of these protocols because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively less scientific experience and historical comparison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data are available for these shorter test scenarios. Upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration, EPA agrees that the 90-day protocol is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable and more cost effective than either of the alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the NPRM for purposes of the F/FA registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. EPA recognizes that the shorter tests might miss some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse health effects that might be identified with the 90-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Apart from the study duration, the SIDS protocol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes somewhat less information for each endpoint, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison with the selected 90-day subchronic inhalation study, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with relatively small savings in time and cost. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIDS protocol includes a fertility screen (i.e., one-generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive study), but does not include an examination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fetus for teratogenic effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, today's final rule requires F/FA manufacturers to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the more standard 90-day subchronic inhalation protocol for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of health effects, with an exposure regimen of at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least six hours per day, five days per week. EPA judges the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure regimen of five days per week for the 90-day protocol to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the minimum acceptable exposure period for the purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 evaluation. Also, the 90-day protocol provides a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and efficient testing approach that allows the evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several endpoints at the end of the same exposure period using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same exposed test animals. As a result, the modified Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program provides a reduction in the number of animals needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform the evaluation of the endpoints of concern and savings on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission generation and testing costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Tier 2 testing program requires the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of live laboratory animals to whole F/FA emissions. Rodent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species are required and rats are specifically recommended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animal facilities must be operated in compliance with the ``Guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (U.S. DHHS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publication (NIH) 86&hyph;23, 1985). To ensure the quality and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of test results, the performance of all studies will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to conform with good laboratory practice (GLP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. GLP standards specific to this rule are included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.60. As proposed in the NPRM, the GLP standards are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those published in 40 CFR part 792 (revised as of July 1, 1992) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for conducting tests under TSCA, with modifications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the specific goals of this rule. The GLP standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address facility, equipment, organization, quality assurance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel requirements, as well as specifications for proper care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of laboratory animals, handling of test substances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation issues, conduct of studies, record keeping, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting of results.

3. Exposure Route and Concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the exception of the Salmonella assay, the Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing program is based on the inhalation exposure of laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals to diluted whole emissions. Such studies require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure system designed to ensure the controlled generation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution, and delivery of F/FA emissions to the laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals for prolonged periods. Section VI describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology for the generation of F/FA combustion and evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions and the procedures to deliver the emissions to the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals. Requirements for hardware, maintenance, and the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission generation and inhalation systems are included in &sect;79.57 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;79.61 of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before testing the emissions of a particular fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive/base fuel mixture, a manufacturer must determine an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate range of exposure concentrations to be used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization of potential health effects. The objective is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to select exposure concentrations to determine a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration-response curve that may predict the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risks associated with a particular exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concentrations should be spaced to produce test groups with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of toxic effects. In order to accomplish this, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that at least three concentration levels be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construct the concentration-response curve. These levels should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correspond to, at a minimum: (1) an overtly or highly toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, (2) a concentration having an intermediate level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity, and (3) a minimally toxic or non-toxic level. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest concentration should result in toxic effects but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a level of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation of the resulting data. The lowest concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should produce minimal or no observable toxic effects. If more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than one intermediate concentration level is used, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects. Due to the inherent toxicity of most vehicle emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it might be impossible to precisely select an exposure level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which results in no observable evidence of toxicity, or a no- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). Thus, EPA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring manufacturers to specifically achieve a NOAEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, EPA recommends that manufacturers use available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific approaches (e.g., range-finding test and extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of data results) to design the study with reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration spacing so as to improve the probability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving a NOAEL. In recognition of the possibility that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest achievable exposure concentration (considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting CO concentration) may also be non-toxic, provisions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made for ``limit tests,'' where appropriate. If a test at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest achievable concentration produces no observable toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect(s), then a full study using three concentration levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might not be necessary (see regulatory text for specific endpoint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests).

B. Subchronic Inhalation Study and Endpoint Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described earlier, the Tier 2 health effects testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program includes a 90-day subchronic inhalation study and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ancillary assays/tests for the examination of specific health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects endpoints. Specific assays or analyses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity, and neurotoxicity may be conducted at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90-day study, coordinated with the 90-day exposure, or conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed a separate acute pulmonary test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., lung lavage assay) for the evaluation of pulmonary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity. However, the Tier 2 testing framework of this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule does not require a separate test for the assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulmonary effects because the 90-day subchronic study includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross pathology and histopathology of the lungs and respiratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tract. Pulmonary effects in this final rule will be examined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the standard 90-day inhalation study. Positive results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the end of the exposure period for pulmonary toxicity will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by abnormal gross or histopathological findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to appropriate control animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Subchronic Inhalation Study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subchronic inhalation study is designed to determine a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration-response relationship for potential toxic effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in rodents, resulting from exposure to vehicle/engine emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over a period of 90 days. This test will provide valuable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on general systemic and target organ toxicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including pulmonary effects. This information is considered an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential component for the assessment of potential health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards resulting from the exposure to F/FA emissions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure period of the subchronic study (i.e., 90 days) covers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately one tenth of the life span for the recommended test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal species (i.e., rats). Although life-shortening or tumors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not likely to be observed within the 90 days of exposure, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subchronic study should be able to identify a wide variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific guidelines for the subchronic inhalation study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included in &sect;79.62 of this final rule. The subchronic study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that animals be observed and weighed during the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. Ophthalmological examination, blood chemistry analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organ examination, and histopathology are basic requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 90-day protocol. Hematology and clinical biochemistry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations are required to be carried out after 30 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure and just prior to termination. Hematology analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include: hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clotting potential (e.g., clotting time, prothrombin time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thromboplastin time, or platelet count). Clinical biochemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing includes assessment of electrolyte balance, carbohydrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolism, and liver and kidney function. Other specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biochemical tests are described in the regulatory text of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the end of the exposure period, tissues and/or organs from a subgroup of the test animals are specially preserved
according to the requirements of the neurological, pulmonary, and reproductive organ examinations. Tissues/organs
from the main test population are preserved using standard techniques for the general toxicity evaluation. Test
animals will be subjected to a full gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body,
all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. All major organs must be weighed.
Gross pathology must be performed on the following target organs and tissues: liver, kidneys, lungs, adrenals, brain,
and gonads. Histopathology must be performed on all gross lesions and specific organs/tissues, as follows: respiratory
tract (i.e., lungs, nasopharyngeal tissues, trachea), brain, heart, sternum with bone marrow, salivary glands,
liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, reproductive organs (i.e., uterus, cervix, ovaries, testes, epididymides),
aorta, gall bladder, esophagus, stomach, intestinal tract, urinary bladder, representative lymph node, and peripheral
nerve/tissue. Other organs and tissues must be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future histopathological
examination, as described in the regulatory text of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described earlier, the 90-day subchronic inhalation study will serve as a basic framework for the Tier 2 testing
program. The following sections provide brief descriptions of the ancillary assays and other additional test and/or
measures performed under Tier 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Assays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the evaluation of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, Tier 2 includes a battery of three genotoxic assays: Salmonella,
micronucleus (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). These assays are specific for mutagenic/carcinogenic outcomes
at a cellular level, but the tests may not be indicative of non-mutagenic or initiation/promotion cancer mechanisms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Tier 2 genotoxic assays are considered cost-effective indicators of mutagenicity and, by implication,
predictors of suspect carcinogens. The rationale for using these tests for the assessment of potential mutagenic
and carcinogenic effects is based on the general assumption that cancer is a multi-stage process involving a variety
of events that can include genotoxic steps. The general consensus among scientists is that many of the cancers may
be attributable to adverse genetic changes. Because genotoxic steps are generally implicated early in the process
of cancer development, their detection has assumed the status of presumptive carcinogen identification. EPA recognizes
that this working assumption has some limitations because there is always a possibility of having false positive
(mutagenic noncarcinogens) or false negatives (nonmutagenic carcinogens) when evaluating the carcinogenic potential
of the test substance. However, these limitations do not preclude the usefulness and the effectiveness of the genotoxic
assays (i.e., Salmonella, MN, and SCE) as cost-effective predictors of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects
in the context of the Tier 2 testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the Tier 2 assays required for the evaluation of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity is provided in
the following sections. The two in vivo assays (MN and SCE) can be conducted concurrently with the 90-day subchronic
inhalation study (i.e., same animal population). The Salmonella assay is run separately, because it does not require
the exposure of live animals to emissions.

a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella Assay
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Salmonella assay is an in vitro test for mutagenicity and, by implication, for carcinogenicity. The assay makes
use of five mutant strains of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium which cannot grow in a medium deficient in histidine
due to an inherited inability to produce this amino acid. Exposure to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances can elicit
reverse mutations, such that the bacteria regain their ability to grow in a histidine-deficient medium. In this test,
bacteria will be exposed to the semi-volatile and particulate extracts of combustion emissions (see Section VI.B.2
for information on sampling of combustion emissions for testing). Test procedures for this assay have been described
in previous literature.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 After exposure, the cells will be plated on histidine-deficient media (both with and without metabolic activation)
and incubated for a designated period of time. The number of emissions-induced mutant colonies (revertants) growing
on the plates will then be compared to the number of spontaneous revertants in control cultures. The testing guidelines
for the Salmonella assay are included in &sect;79.68 of this final rule.

In Vivo Micronucleus (MN) Assay
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Micronuclei are sub-cellular structures containing chromosomes and chromosome fragments not incorporated into
the main nucleus during cell division. While micronuclei do form under natural conditions, exposure to potentially
mutagenic or carcinogenic agents can cause an increase in micronucleated cells. In this assay, live rodents will
be exposed by inhalation to the emissions of the particular fuel or additive/base fuel mixture (this assay is applicable
to the evaluation of both combustion and evaporative emissions). Subsequently, erythrocytes in the bone marrow
will be sampled, stained, and viewed under a light microscope. The number of erythrocytes containing micronuclei
will then be counted and compared with erythrocytes from untreated animals. The use of erythrocytes in this procedure
facilitates the visualization of micronuclei, since their primary nucleus is normally extruded during cell development.
The testing guidelines for the MN assay are contained in &sect;79.62 and &sect;79.64 of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A positive result for the MN assay is determined by a statistically significant concentration-related increase
in the number of micronucleated erythrocytes or a reproducible and statistically significant positive response
for at least one of the test concentrations.

In Vivo Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. SCEs are believed to be caused by chromosome strand breakage resulting in exchanges of genetic material between
the halves of a chromosome ``pair'' (i.e., the chromatids). While some SCEs occur normally, an increase in the frequency
of such exchanges may be indicative of carcinogenic activity. In this assay, animals which have undergone inhalation
exposure to the emissions will be sacrificed (this assay is applicable to the evaluation of both combustion and evaporative
emissions). Peripheral blood lymphocytes will then be isolated and cultured. The cells will be treated with a DNA
base analog (bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU) and with a spindle inhibitor such as colchicine. After appropriate staining
for labeled DNA, SCEs will be scored from cells arrested in the second mitotic division and the results compared with
appropriate controls. Details on the SCE testing procedures are included in &sect;79.62 and &sect;79.65 of this
final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A positive result for the SCE assay is determined by a statistically significant concentration-related increase
in the number of SCE or a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test
concentrations.

3. Fertility Screen for Reproductive and Teratologic Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fertility screen involves mating of test animals previously exposed (by inhalation) to F/FA emissions to examine
the effects of such exposure on conception. The females will continue their exposures throughout pregnancy and will
be assessed for teratologic effects on their offspring. This test is applicable to the evaluation of both combustion
and evaporative emissions. The fertility assessment is coordinated with the 90-day subchronic inhalation study
and replaces the separate reproductive and teratology studies originally proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reproductive assessment includes vaginal cell smears to track effects on the estrous cycle. Commenters discouraged
the use of frequent vaginal smearing. In response to the comments, vaginal cyclicity determinations will be performed
on the test subjects for two weeks prior to the start of the exposure period (for culling acyclic females), and will
resume after seven weeks of exposure (for four weeks or until the female is confirmed pregnant). The assessment for
reproductive effects also includes a mating trial and the weighing and histopathological examination of male and
female reproductive organs (i.e., uterus, ovaries, testes, epididymis, and seminal vesicles), all of which can
be performed within the context of the 90-day subchronic inhalation study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As compared with appropriate control animals, positive results for reproductive effects include: changes in the
length or stages of the estrous cycle as indicated by the vaginal cytology data, changes in reproductive organ weights,
and pathological changes found during gross or microscopic examination of male or female reproductive organs. Changes
in fecundity, fertility or litter size (number of normal fetuses) will also be regarded as positive results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess potential teratogenic effects, each dam will be sacrificed on the day prior to normal parturition and its
uterus examined for embryonic or fetal deaths. Viable fetuses will be counted and then examined for skeletal and soft
tissue anomalies. These results will be evaluated relative to the number of spontaneous embryonic or fetal deaths
and abnormalities in unexposed controls. The required analysis covers specific fetal effects outcomes, i.e., in
utero death, growth alteration, and structural abnormalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the NPRM proposed the use of two different species for the evaluation of teratogenic effects, today's action
requires the use of only one species to satisfy the Tier 2 requirements. This modification will reduce the number of
animals needed for Tier 2 tests, as requested by some of the commenters, while maintaining an adequate approach for
the screening of teratology effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above described combined protocol will detect fertility problems and teratogenic effects. EPA realizes that
the protocol will not detect adverse effects on reproductive development that might appear in the offspring as they
grow and mature (since pups are examined just before birth). However, EPA judges that the combined protocol provides
a reasonable screen for both reproductive and teratogenic effects. The testing guidelines for the fertility assessment
are included in &sect;79.62 and &sect;79.63 of this final rule.

4. Neurotoxicity Screen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed in the NPRM to require the Functional Observational Neurotoxicity Battery (FONB) for the evaluation
of neurotoxic effects. In addition to the FONB, EPA asked for comment on the possible inclusion of a biochemical assay
to measure the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Comments were received on both proposed tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated industry objected to the use of the FONB on the basis of their belief that it would be likely to give artifactual
test results. Commenters also expressed concern about the use of the GFAP assay. They considered it to be a sensitive
marker for neurotoxicity, but discouraged its use because they perceived that adequate historical data are not available
for this test. While not necessarily agreeing with either of these comments, EPA has reconsidered its original proposal
regarding the specific content of the Tier 2 neurotoxicity assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA considers the FONB to be a well-validated standard test and recognizes its extensive use in the past. In the context
of this F/FA emissions testing program, however, EPA believes that, rather than requiring the FONB on a standard basis
within the Tier 2 testing regimen, the FONB is more appropriately reserved for use when a neurotoxicity concern has
been identified and additional testing is needed to clarify the nature and/or significance of the potential adverse
effects (e.g., within Tier 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the GFAP assay, EPA judges that concerns about the amount of historical data are not sufficient justification
to prevent its use in the F/FA program, given its high specificity and potential applicability as a screening test.
This final rule thus includes the GFAP assay as an element in the Tier 2 assessment of potential neurotoxic effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GFAP assay is a biochemical assay that measures the level of a major intermediate filament protein of astrocytes
(cells of the supporting structure of the nervous system) from brain tissues. An increase in the GFAP level is highly
specific for detecting the existence and location of chemical-induced injury to the central nervous system (CNS)
associated with astrocytic hypertrophy. However, due to its specificity, the assay does not provide information
on other potential sites for neurotoxic effects. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, today's rule supplements
the GFAP assay with an expanded neurohistopathology examination as part of the 90-day subchronic inhalation study.
The neurohistopathology involves the examination of several brain sections, including the cerebrum, cerebellum,
medulla, cervical bulb of the spinal cord, and peripheral nerves (e.g., tibial or sciatic nerve). Testing guidelines
for the neurotoxicity evaluation are included in &sect;79.62, &sect;79.66 (neuropathology assessment), and &sect;79.67
(GFAP) of this final rule. Positive results at the end of the exposure period for neurotoxicity will be indicated by
an increase in the GFAP level and/or abnormal gross or histopathological findings relative to appropriate control
animals. The neurotoxicity screen is applicable to the evaluation of both combustion and evaporative emissions.

C. Adequate Endpoint Information in Lieu of Tier 2 Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the functions of the data search requirement under Tier 1 (as discussed in Section VII.A.2) is to enable F/FA
manufacturers to examine the available literature and determine if adequate data exists (for both combustion and
evaporative emissions, as applicable) that would satisfy the Tier 2 testing requirements, so that duplication of
effort can be avoided. In addition to existing test data from protocols similar to those specified in the Tier 2 testing
program, EPA will consider results from other test protocols to be adequate in lieu of new testing, as long as the alternative
methods provide comparable information. Table 2 provides criteria for determining what constitutes adequate existing
data in lieu of the specified Tier 2 tests, and includes an example list of comparable tests for each Tier 2 endpoint.
EPA recognizes that changes and scientific advances in toxicology testing may result in the development of additional
techniques and methods that could be applicable to the Tier 2 testing requirements of this program in the future. In
deciding if a specific protocol is acceptable in lieu of a Tier 2 test, manufacturers must also address other specific
criteria for Tier 2 requirements, as explained below.

In general, for existing information to fulfill the Tier 2 testing requirements, it must include the in vivo inhalation
exposure to whole motor vehicle emissions (combustion or evaporative, as applicable), except for the few in vitro
studies acceptable for carcinogenicity/mutagenicity assessment. In order to be acceptable, previous toxicity
studies must include exposure to non-catalyzed emissions, as required in this final rule. EPA is requiring the use
of an evaporative emission generator for the evaporative emission testing. However, EPA will accept previous inhalation
exposure studies of whole evaporative emissions in which the emissions were generated using standard evaporative
emission procedures under FTP conditions. Raw product tests, using F/FAs in the uncombusted state, are not considered
adequate replacements for Tier 2 combustion emission testing. In addition, studies using whole aerosolized preparations
or tests on individual emission products of the fuel or additive cannot be used as substitutes for whole emission testing
for either combustion or evaporative emissions. The reason for this requirement is that, as explained in Section
III.A.2 of this preamble, this rule focuses on the effects of whole emissions rather than raw F/FAs or individual emission
products. Tests performed on the emissions of F/FAs which are classified in the same group as the subject fuel or additive
are considered relevant, but tests on products not conforming to the grouping criteria of the subject fuel or additive
do not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other important parameters to consider in determining if existing studies are adequate include: the type and number
of test subjects, the number and adequacy of dosages, the methodology and duration of exposure, and the technical
methods used for monitoring the progress of the test and for analyzing the results. Generally, 90-days is the minimum
acceptable length of exposure. However, an existing study having a shorter exposure period might be considered adequate
if the test results are positive, i.e., adverse effects are observed. Previously-conducted studies using mammals
other than rodents may be acceptable in lieu of rodent testing, if the existing studies meet all other applicable criteria
for adequacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, the Salmonella assay is always required because of its broad sensitivity
and specificity for detecting chemical exposures having mutagenic and/or carcinogenic potential. Manufacturers
should note (see Table 2) that when a registrant needs to conduct new Tier 2 testing, two in vivo assays (MN and SCE),
in addition to the Salmonella assay, are required to satisfy the carcinogenicity endpoint. However, in lieu of new
testing, a manufacturer may rely on one existing in vivo assay for carcinogenicity, in addition to the Salmonella
assay and another in vitro assay. In other words, two in vivo tests for carcinogenicity are required if new testing
is performed, but only one in vivo study is required if the manufacturer relies on existing carcinogenicity information.
The reason for this is that the incremental costs of performing the two specified in vivo assays (MN and SCE) within
the 90-day inhalation protocol (as required in this final rule) is low in comparison with the amount of useful data
obtained. This approach is cost-effective because the same animals used in the inhalation study can also be used for
the in vivo carcinogenicity assays. In fact, fewer resources will be spent to do both the MN and SCE assays within a single
group of inhalation-exposed animals than to conduct just one of these tests along with a separate in vitro carcinogenicity
assay (in addition to the Salmonella assay).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tier 2 tests described above pertain to all designated F/FAs, unless mitigated by special provisions or comparable
data from adequately performed and documented previous studies. In general, EPA considers this standard testing
program to be necessary for the health effects evaluation of F/FA emissions, even if further evaluation may be required
under the provisions of Tier 3. However, this final rule also adopts the special provision discussed in the Reopening
Notice, under which EPA retains the authority to modify the standard Tier 2 test requirements in certain instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exercise of this authority will be done wholly at EPA's initiative and discretion. The alternative Tier 2 provision
is intended to provide a degree of flexibility to EPA when available information indicates that, in a specific case,
another testing regimen is preferable to the standard set of Tier 2 tests. There are three scenarios under which EPA
generally anticipates the possible use of this provision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, for a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group), information may be available (independent of the requirements
of this rule) which may cause EPA to be concerned about potential health effects related to an endpoint not specifically
addressed in Tier 2. In such an instance, the alternative Tier 2 provision allows EPA to require additional studies
targeted to the identified area of concern, even though these studies are not normally included in Tier 2. While the
standard structure of this rule also allows EPA to prescribe the additional tests under Tier 3, the alternative Tier
2 provision enables EPA to prescribe and receive the desired data earlier in the process. This flexibility is particularly
important given that this final rule allows up to six years for Tier 2 submittal. When the additional testing can be
coordinated with the standard Tier 2 testing program, the alternative Tier 2 provision will also save costs relative
to conducting the additional tests at a separate point in time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, independent of the information to be submitted under this rule for a particular F/FA product (or group), EPA
may identify a potentially significant public health risk related to a Tier 2 endpoint, such that EPA knows that more
definitive testing will be required for this endpoint than is ordinarily required under Tier 2. Again, EPA could require
such testing under Tier 3 after the evaluation of Tier 2. However, the alternative Tier 2 provision can facilitate
earlier and potentially more efficient acquisition of the required data. If appropriate to the case at hand, EPA would
substitute the more definitive endpoint test for the standard Tier 2 test (with appropriate deadline adjustment).
In such a case, EPA's authority to waive the requirement to provide the respective Tier 2 test derives from its authority
in section 211(e) to provide exemptions from testing when such testing would be duplicative. In this example, because
the substituted test would address the endpoint more rigorously than the standard Tier 2 assessment, it would be duplicative
to require both evaluations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, EPA may identify concerns about the effects of F/FA emissions involving different engine and/or emission
control technologies than those ordinarily required for generating the emissions tested in Tier 2. For example,
biological testing using catalyzed instead of non-catalyzed emissions might be required if emission species of
concern are present in the catalyzed exhaust of a fuel or additive that are not represented in the untreated exhaust.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 In this case, EPA could prescribe a Tier 2 program using catalyzed instead of non-catalyzed emissions under the alternative
Tier 2 provision. Otherwise, the manufacturer of this product would likely be required to conduct a second series
of biological tests with catalyzed emissions, under Tier 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in Section VI.A, the use of non-catalyzed emissions are normally required in the Tier 2 toxicology tests.
Under Tier 1, however both catalyzed and non-catalyzed emissions are required to be characterized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the alternative Tier 2 provision will give EPA the flexibility, when indicated, to prescribe additional
tests to be performed along with the standard Tier 2 program, to substitute different tests, and/or to modify the underlying
vehicle/engine specifications for Tier 2. When EPA exercises its authority under this special provision, it will
allow an appropriate time for completion of the prescribed alternative tests. EPA may also use the alternative Tier
2 authority to waive certain Tier 2 endpoint evaluations (generally on occasions when additional and/or more rigorous
tests are being required for other Tier 2 endpoints). However, Tier 2 endpoint tests will not be waived in the absence
of adequate information or requirements for more rigorous testing of the endpoint(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to exercise this special authority only in exceptional cases. When EPA decides to use the alternative
Tier 2 provision, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified mail letter of the specific
modifications in lieu of the standard Tier 2 program, along with a schedule for compliance and submittal of test results.
The manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) will have 60 days to comment on the prescribed alternative Tier 2 testing
program and timing requirements. If the responsible manufacturer does not provide any comments, EPA will assume
that the manufacturer has consented in full with the prescribed testing regimen. EPA will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to inform the public of its intent to require alternative testing for a particular F/FA manufacturer and that a copy
of the letter to the manufacturer is available in the public record of this rule for review and comment. Additional
correspondence between EPA and the responsible manufacturer regarding alternative testing requirements will
also be placed in the public record. After receipt and review of all comments received (or, if no comments are received),
EPA will publish a notice of final action on the proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed to notify manufacturers of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements within
18 months of promulgation of the final rule (for registered F/FAs) or within 18 months of EPA's receipt of intent to
register (for currently unregistered F/FAs). Comments received from the industry indicated that this notification
period was too long relative to the proposed three year deadline for submittal of Tier 2 results. However, EPA believes
the proposed notification period is reasonable, given that this final rule allows manufacturers up to six years for
submittal of Tier 2 results. Furthermore, EPA believes that restricting the time period for exercising the alternative
Tier 2 authority is unnecessary and disadvantageous to the public interest as well as the regulated industry, since
this provision establishes a mechanism to provide needed data on a timely basis and to eliminate unnecessary screening
studies when substitute tests will be required. Therefore, while EPA will endeavor to notify manufacturers of proposed
alternative Tier 2 requirements within 18 months, this final rule permits EPA to notify manufacturers of proposed
alternative Tier 2 requirements at any time prior to EPA's receipt of Tier 2 data. If a manufacturer receiving such
notification has already begun the standard Tier 2 toxicology testing, then EPA will refrain from requiring the testing;
however, in such cases, the manufacturer is required to submit the results of the standard Tier 2 tests within one year
of the date when testing began. In other cases, EPA will consider the potential costs, burdens, and timing factors
in making its final decisions on alternative Tier 2 requirements.

A. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the submitted Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data, or any other available information, EPA will determine whether
further testing and/or analysis for the subject fuel or fuel additive is needed under the provisions of Tier 3. Given
the variety of evaluations included in Tiers 1 and 2 and the wide range of possible interrelated outcomes which could
be obtained, EPA proposed to use its discretion in determining the need for Tier 3 testing on a case-by-case basis.
Decisions on the need for follow-up testing within Tier 3 would depend on expert scientific judgment as to the availability
of adequate data to enable a health risk evaluation and the need for more definitive information for developing regulatory
decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requested comments on the proposed discretionary nature of Tier 3 determinations and on a possible alternative
approach involving the establishment of ``automatic triggers'' for Tier 3 decisions, i.e., specific outcomes of
Tiers 1 and 2 which would make Tier 3 testing mandatory. Responses included both support and opposition to the proposed
Tier 3 discretionary approach. EPA evaluated all comments and determined that decisions on Tier 3 requirements should
remain at the discretion of EPA. In order to accomplish the goals of the program, it is essential for EPA to be able to
examine the Tier 1 and Tier 2 data prior to prescribing additional tests. The need for and content of Tier 3 testing will
most often be dependent on the results of the earlier tiers. In these cases, decisions on Tier 3 can only be reasonably
specified after EPA's review of the applicant's initial submittal. The purpose of Tier 3 is not to fill all data gaps,
but to establish a program that provides the Administrator with the necessary and reasonable information to make
regulatory decisions. Based on this rationale, EPA judges that it is neither practical nor desirable to specify criteria
which will automatically force F/FA manufacturers to perform additional testing under Tier 3. Thus, EPA will use
its discretion to determine Tier 3 requirements on a case-by-case basis, allowing EPA to target specific regulatory
needs. Although EPA can use the Tier 3 data to support regulatory actions, referral to Tier 3 level is not mandatory
before beginning actions under CAA section 211(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for Tier 3 testing and/or analysis will depend, in part, on whether Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data provide sufficient
toxicity and exposure information to determine the potential health risks associated with a particular fuel or fuel
additive. The endpoints to be addressed and the nature of the studies to be performed under Tier 3 are to be determined
on a case-by-case basis. Tier 3 studies will most often be required to further explicate the results of the tests/analyses
performed under Tiers 1 and 2 or to address other areas of concern highlighted by the literature search. If additional
toxicity testing is required under Tier 3, the test might entail whole emissions (as in Tier 2), or the testing of one
or more individual emission species identified to be of particular concern. EPA could also use other information
(available outside this program) to require testing under Tier 3.

While the specific objectives and scope of Tier 3 testing will vary depending on the concerns identified in the earlier
tiers or any other information available to EPA, examples of possible areas for further testing are: chronic/lifetime
studies, chemical disposition/metabolism studies, exposure studies, dosimetry analyses, additional emission
characterization/speciation, additional modeling analysis, environmental toxicity tests, testing using different
emission generation procedures or emission control systems, or any other additional evaluation approach EPA deems
necessary to assess the health and/or welfare effects of a particular fuel or fuel additive. The previous examples
and the discussion below in no way limit the scope of Tier 3 or EPA's authority to require further testing under this
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule specifically includes under Tier 3 any health effects testing to be performed on aerosol additives (see
Section X.C for details on the special provision for aerosol products). Due to the special nature and use of this type
of product, EPA judges that any testing needs will require non-standard test procedures that can be better addressed
under Tier 3. EPA will review the composition information and literature data on the specific aerosol product and
will determine if health effects testing is needed on a case-by-case basis. For example, if available literature,
submitted under Tier 1, indicates that a component of an aerosol product is highly toxic, and the product is widely
produced, then Tier 3 testing on the aerosol product would likely be indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modeling of potential exposures, atmospheric reactivity, and/or environmental fate/partitioning may also be
required under Tier 3, as explained in Section III.C. For example, if a fuel or additive is widely distributed and Tier
2 data indicate serious concern for health effects, EPA might require more extensive exposure analysis and/or modeling
under Tier 3 to better define potential risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the grouping mechanism included in this rule allows F/FA manufacturers to submit Tier 1 and Tier 2 data on
the representative of a designated group for purposes of registration, EPA retains the authority under Tier 3 to require
testing on any member product of a group. Thus, when follow-up testing is required under Tier 3 authority, the specified
test(s) could be required to be conducted on the selected representative or on any other member of an existing group.
Testing on additional F/FA products could be required if EPA identifies a concern for any member of the group other
than the group representative. For example, the testing representative for the M85 group (consisting of methanol
formulations containing 50&hyph;95 percent methanol) is an M85 base fuel containing 85 percent methanol by volume.
In the future, other methanol fuels could enter the market and be used extensively, triggering a concern for exposure
and potential health risks. In this case, EPA could require Tier 3 testing for another methanol formulation within
the M85 group.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another possible Tier 3 effort could involve the testing of combinations of oxygenates. Although groups for non-baseline
gasolines are defined on the basis of individual oxygenates, EPA could request additional testing to address mixtures
of oxygenates under Tier 3 authority. For example, if a registered non-baseline gasoline formulation containing
a mixture of oxygenates is widely produced and used, resulting in high exposures and potential health risks, EPA could
require testing of this formulation under Tier 3. Tier 3 tests for this formulation could involve standard Tier 1 or
Tier 2 tests, testing for other endpoints not addressed under Tier 2, or testing for other areas of concern (e.g., exposure
analysis, environmental testing, etc.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also retains the authority to require additional testing using different vehicle/engine technologies and/or
emission generation specifications than those prescribed for Tier 1 and Tier 2 analyses. To reduce the costs of the
program, today's action requires the use of a single vehicle model for emission generation. However, if EPA determines
that emissions from other applicable vehicle/engine technologies might differ significantly for a given fuel or
additive/base fuel mixture, then EPA may require additional emission characterization and/or toxicological testing
under Tier 3 using different vehicle/engine technology. Also, although standard Tier 2 tests are to be conducted
using non-catalyzed emissions (as discussed in Section VI.A), EPA could require the use of catalyzed emissions for
testing under Tier 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a determination has been made that Tier 3 testing is required, EPA will inform the responsible manufacturer by
certified mail of the purpose and nature of the testing to be performed along with a schedule for compliance and submittal
of the Tier 3 report to EPA. EPA will also publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, notifying the public that the letter to the manufacturer is available in the public record for review and comment.
The affected manufacturer's comments and EPA's response to these comments will be placed in the public record, as
well. After receipt and review of all comments received (or, if no comments are received), EPA will publish a notice
of final action on the proposed Tier 3 requirements in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed in the NPRM to provide the responsible manufacturer or group a 30-day comment period to respond to EPA's
requirements under Tier 3. In their commentary, the regulated industry asked EPA to extend this comment period to
60 days to allow for appropriate time for review, analysis, and preparation of a written response to EPA regarding
the designated protocol(s) to be used for Tier 3 tests. EPA judged that this request was reasonable, thus today's rule
gives F/FA manufacturers 60 days to comment on the EPA-prescribed Tier 3 requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsible manufacturer is expected to submit detailed protocols for review and approval by EPA prior to beginning
Tier 3 testing. Tier 3 tests must comply with the pre-approved specifications given by EPA. If manufacturers experience
unforeseen difficulties while conducting the prescribed Tier 3 tests approved by EPA (e.g., excess mortality observed
half-way through a chronic bioassay), they will be allowed to request a modification of the requirements. This mechanism
would apply to unusual circumstances that are outside the control of the manufacturer. If testing problems are identified,
EPA must be notified as soon as possible so that requirements can be modified.

B. Criteria for Referral to Tier 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section presents some of the guidelines and considerations which EPA will use in determining the necessity for
additional testing under a discretionary Tier 3 testing approach. Consistent with the discretionary decision-making
process for Tier 3, this discussion is not intended to provide an exhaustive, limiting, or definitive listing of relevant
criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to require manufacturers to submit additional testing on the health, environmental, or welfare effects
of F/FA emissions will take into account the cumulative information provided by Tiers 1 and 2, including previous
scientific data, emissions characterization data, biological test results, and any ancillary information which
may be available to EPA. Thus, decisions to require Tier 3 level testing will be made only after all the requirements
of Tiers 1 and 2 have been adequately satisfied (with the exception of special cases as discussed in Section VIII.D).
Adherence to this principle will prevent unnecessarily costly or poorly targeted decisions based on piecemeal,
out-of-context information, and will promote more precise identification and evaluation of data gaps, and more
cost-efficient coordination of potential test requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimately, EPA must be able to decide whether or not the use of a fuel or fuel additive is likely to create unacceptable
health or welfare risks. If a risk decision is made possible by the information from Tiers 1 and 2, then Tier 3 will not
be required. However, if such a risk decision cannot be made on the basis of the Tiers 1 and 2 data, then Tier 3 testing
will be mandated. Therefore, to make a determination on the need for Tier 3 testing, EPA scientists will evaluate the
extent to which the results of Tiers 1 and 2 are adequate for such decisions, guided by the basic principles of risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A risk assessment requires the merging of a health effects assessment (including hazard identification and concentration-response
relationship) and an exposure assessment. Such an assessment can range from a qualitative to a highly quantitative
analysis, depending upon the extent of the available data. EPA recognizes that a quantitative assessment might not
be possible at the end of Tier 2.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 However, Tiers 1 and 2 might indicate that little hazard is present and that exposures may be quite low and limited geographically.
In such a case, there may be no reason to pursue further testing at the Tier 3 level to improve risk assessment information.
On the other hand, Tiers 1 and 2 might suggest that a hazard is likely and that exposures could be significant because
of the production volume and ubiquitous use of a product, but the data may still be inadequate for a quantitative risk
assessment. In this case, Tier 3 testing could be indicated to provide the needed information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
However, if adequate information exists, EPA does not rule out the possibility of conducting such risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the principles and critical data elements of the risk assessment process will provide a useful guide for
identifying whether meaningful information gaps remain and for determining the specific objectives of potential
Tier 3 testing. However, EPA does not intend to conduct a formal risk assessment as part of its decision on whether to
promote a fuel or fuel additive (or group) to Tier 3. Rather, EPA will evaluate the quality and certainty of the toxicity
and concentration-response data and consider qualitatively whether such data weighs in favor of or against further
testing. A formal risk assessment will be more likely to be developed at such a time that there is a need for action to
control or prohibit a product under the regulatory authority of CAA section 211(c).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following sections discuss key factors which EPA will consider in identifying the need for and content of Tier
3 testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Statistical Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously mentioned, scientific judgment will be exercised in determining whether Tier 3 testing is indicated.
An important factor in such judgments will be the interpretation of and significance ascribed to ``negative'' results
obtained in Tiers 1 and 2. To address this issue, EPA will consider statistical information such as the probability
of Type I and Type II errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Type I error occurs when a false positive conclusion is made, while a Type II error is a false negative conclusion.
The acceptability of a specific Type II error is related to the acceptability of false negatives in the particular
study being performed. For example, from a toxicological perspective, screening assays often have a relatively
high probability of producing false negative (Type II) outcomes, since some major aspects of organ or tissue toxicity
are not being examined. Thus, an acceptable Type II error for screening assays will typically be high. However, the
level of Type II error considered acceptable should be tempered by the goal of the study. A higher false negative conclusion
(e.g., Type II error of 0.2) will generally be acceptable if it refers to an effect of minimal severity at a high-exposure
test level relative to ambient concentration and if few people are likely to be exposed. The converse will also hold
true. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scientifically sound statistical analyses are a crucial part of any reliable study and will provide key information
for EPA to make judgments on whether or not Tier 3 testing is needed. While it is not feasible to list all possible scenarios
and results for each Tier 2 endpoint, the above discussion describes how some of the statistical factors will be incorporated
into EPA's decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Exposure Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tier 1 requirements will provide EPA with information on the composition of F/FA emissions and potential exposures
to F/FA products. This information includes: (1) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components, (2)
possible literature search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures, (3) literature information
on the potential fate and environmental effects, and (4) a qualitative exposure analysis (submitted by the manufacturer
or group) based on the production and use of the F/FA product(s). As mentioned above, this information will be considered
qualitatively by EPA in determining the extent of potential exposures and whether additional testing or analysis
is needed to assess risks quantitatively. As discussed earlier, EPA has the authority to require exposure modeling
or analysis under Tier 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant public health concerns might sometimes be revealed by the submitted information on product composition,
total annual production volume and market distribution data, and emissions data. This might be the case, for example,
if there was a significant annual release of emission compounds with known toxicities, or if the anticipated exposures
approached or exceeded current estimates of apparently safe levels of known toxicants. In the case of high-volume
fuels and their associated bulk additives, EPA will generally assume that human and environmental exposures will
be of sufficient level and extent that significant observed adverse effects could indicate a need for follow-up in
Tier 3. This exposure assumption reflects the high production and consumption of these products, either at the present
time or as anticipated in the future. Thus, decisions to refer these products to Tier 3 will be based on the degree to
which additional testing is needed to clarify the results and potential health effect and environmental implications
identified in the previous tiers. On the other hand, it cannot be assumed that fuel additives used in relatively low
concentrations or produced in relatively low volumes will automatically be excused from Tier 3. For these products,
test results indicative of severe health effects and/or high exposure levels (e.g., during consumer use) might be
cause for escalation to Tier 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Health Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General criteria for evaluating the potential public health effects associated with fuel and additive emissions
will include: (1) The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint, (2) the identification of
a concentration-effect relationship, (3) the statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies, (4) the
severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects will likely lead to incapacitating or irreversible conditions),
and (5) the consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes. Additional parameters
which will influence the decision on whether to require Tier 3 will include: (1) The nature and amount of known toxic
agents in the emissions stream and (2) the observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important
exposure route for inducing adverse health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These criteria will be evaluated in conjunction with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 results to determine whether or not higher
level testing is needed. In this decision, both the biological and statistical significance of the Tiers 1 and 2 results
will be taken into account. Generally, escalation to Tier 3 may be judged necessary when remaining uncertainties
about the significance of observed outcomes and/or potential exposures interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable
estimates of potential health risks. On the other hand, if no statistically significant effects are obtained at any
exposure level in a scientifically sound Tier 2 study (or existing test submitted in lieu of Tier 2 testing and not contradicted
by other published reports of equal or greater reliability), and if other major sources of concern do not arise (e.g.,
toxic effects of structurally related compounds), then Tier 3 testing is not likely to be required for the endpoint
in question.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This discussion assumes that relevant, high-quality statistical analyses have been done to permit the negative
test results to be properly evaluated and interpreted. The statistical analyses recommended for Tier 2, including
determination of Type I and II error (as discussed in Section IX.B.1), should enable reasonable conclusions to be
drawn as to the significance of negative findings. Factors to be taken into account include the toxicological nature
of the findings and the exposure levels used in the test. For example, if the statistical analyses are applied to a ``severe''
endpoint (e.g., major fetal abnormalities, major lung pathology, etc.) and the exposure in question is moderate,
then a relatively low Type II error level may be appropriate. In contrast, if a high concentration limit test causes
a relatively minor effect (e.g., a small change in estrous cyclicity), a higher Type II error may be allowed, effectively
increasing the chance of false negative conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Evaluation of Tier 2 Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific outcomes which will be considered positive and negative results for each Tier 2 test were mentioned briefly
in the previous descriptions of Tier 2 requirements (see Section VIII.B) and are defined and interpreted more precisely
in the regulatory text of this final rule. For example, three primary assays (i.e., Salmonella, MN, and SCE) are included
in Tier 2 for the screening of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. As compared with appropriate controls, a statistically
significant concentration-related positive response in any one of these assays could be cause for concern, as will
be positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of these tests. Such outcomes will be indicative
of mutagenic and/or carcinogenic risk. Positive results will also indicate that the emissions could initiate some
of the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. However, these results will generally not in themselves be sufficient
to determine whether the emissions were in fact carcinogenic because the development of cancer is a multi-step process.
Depending on the internal and historical consistency of the results and their relationship to projected exposures,
further testing might be required to determine the significance of the mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity/risks
in human populations exposed by inhalation. In contrast, if no statistically significant results are obtained in
the three assays and no conflicting results are found in the literature or in any other Tier 2 tests, then Tier 3 follow-up
of potential carcinogenic/mutagenic effects is not likely to be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To take another example, determination of the need to investigate further reproductive or teratogenic risks will
take into account the outcome of the results of the estrous cyclicity measurements, the histopathological evaluation
of reproductive organs, the outcome of the fertility screen, and the outcome of the teratogenicity evaluation. If
negative results are obtained in the above evaluations (according to statistically sound principles), and if these
results are not refuted by the existing literature, then additional testing is not likely to be required at the Tier
3 level for reproductive or teratogenic effects. Positive results for the teratogenicity study will include a decrease
in neonatal viability relative to that in control studies, a significant change in the proportion of viable male versus
female fetuses or offspring, the presence of soft tissue or skeletal abnormalities, and an increased rate of embryonic
or fetal resorption. Other positive outcomes related to reproductive effects, such as decreased fertility, decreased
litter size, abnormal changes in vaginal cytology or reproductive organ histopathology, will be indicative of hazards
to the adult reproductive systems. The need for additional evaluation under Tier 3 will depend on the specificity,
severity, and consistency of results, the presence or absence of a concentration-effect relationship, and the significance
of these outcomes in view of projected exposures. The greater the remaining uncertainty regarding the risk of reproductive
or teratogenic effects after analysis of such factors, the higher will be the likelihood that Tier 3 will be required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, consistent negative results (according to statistically sound principles) obtained in other Tier 2
tests, in the absence of significant related concerns raised in the literature, will (in all likelihood) make Tier
3 unnecessary. If adverse effects are found at Tier 2 and/or reported in the literature, EPA will determine if Tier
3 follow-up is required by attempting to evaluate the nature, severity, and significance of the findings in light
of the likely exposures. If EPA determines that Tier 3 testing is required to resolve the remaining uncertainties,
the Tier 3 requirements will reflect both positive and negative results. For example, if the results of Tier 2 were
positive for pulmonary effects but negative for neurotoxicity (according to criteria discussed earlier), and if
these results were consistent with the literature, only pulmonary toxicity would be a likely candidate for Tier 3
follow-up testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Potential Tier 3 Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be most cost-effective, Tier 3 testing will be designed to address specific data gaps regarding health effects
endpoints of concern or health and environment-related issues requiring further analysis. For instance, Tier 3
requirements could potentially include further emission characterization procedures, perhaps involving additional
vehicles and/or more rigorous pre-conditioning methods, to identify and quantify harmful emission products with
greater precision. Higher-order modeling calculations or exposure field studies could be required to resolve uncertainties
in the Tier 1 emissions exposure information. Health or welfare effects testing requirements will be aimed at providing
sufficient information to make sound conclusions about the degree of health or welfare risk. If more than one endpoint
is of concern, EPA will attempt to reduce testing costs by permitting combined protocols insofar as possible.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tier 3 tests for specific endpoints could require the determination of a NOAEL. Depending on the endpoint under evaluation,
consideration will be given to including a mid-duration examination in the case of chronic inhalation tests. A mid-duration
evaluation will be useful for affirming the adequacy of exposure levels and, in some cases, might enable interim risk
conclusions to be drawn which will avoid the need for further examination. Inhalation studies will generally make
use of rodent species, but higher order mammals could be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Tier 3 testing requirements will be targeted to critical areas of concern, EPA will also exercise its judgment
to avoid the false economy of establishing overly narrow requirements. Just as requirements for too many assays would
be wasteful of resources, requirements for too few assays might result in inconclusive findings, creating needs
for still further testing at greater total expense than would have been necessary at the start. Similarly, EPA will
consider the value of including secondary evaluations as useful and low-cost adjuncts to tests already required.
For example, if the histopathology of a specified target organ was the primary examination required at the conclusion
of an inhalation exposure, other organs could be weighed and saved in storage for a limited time period, at low incremental
expense. If indicated, these other organs would then be available for subsequent examination, avoiding the possible
need to repeat the chronic inhalation procedures to assess the effects on other organs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the specific health testing requirements which will be imposed in Tier 3 will be tailored to individual circumstances,
precise test guidelines cannot be provided in advance. However, some examples of testing scenarios which might be
required under Tier 3 are cited in &sect;79.54 in the accompanying regulatory text. Where possible, existing standard
guidelines for these tests are referenced. It should be recognized, however, that such guidelines might need to be
revised to accommodate emission inhalation requirements and/or to evaluate certain structures or functions which
the current guidelines do not adequately address. Study parameters which might require modification include exposure
routes and concentrations, species selection, number of animal subjects, examination procedures and frequencies,
and analytic requirements. Furthermore, interim advances in the underlying science and testing technology may
provide superior approaches which could be available for use by the time Tier 3 requirements are implemented.

X. Special Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following sections describe special provisions included in the F/FA registration program to avoid duplication
of effort, to alleviate the financial impact on small businesses, and to ease the burdens of the program on the regulated
industry in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Experimental F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA requested comments on the possibility of providing a temporary program exemption or deferment for experimental
F/FAs. Eligibility for this special provision was to be limited to unregistered products (i.e., F/FAs which are not
registered as of the effective date of this final rule) or registered products that had not been placed into wholesale
or retail commerce prior to promulgation of this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulated industry provided comments questioning the need for a special provision for experimental F/FAs under
this rulemaking because a provision for experimental products already exists under existing registration rules.
EPA agrees with the comments received and today's rule relies on existing regulations under 40 CFR 79.4(a)(3) and
79.4(b)(2) for the exemption of experimental F/FAs. 40 CFR section 79.4(a)(3) exempts fuels used for research, development
or testing, and 40 CFR section 79.4(b)(2) similarly exempts fuel additives. Based on these existing provisions,
any designated F/FA product sold to automobile, engine, or component manufacturers for research, development or
test purposes, or sold to automobile manufacturers for factory fill, and not in any case offered for commercial sale
to the public, is exempted from the registration requirements of today's rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Relabeled Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A company's product is registered as ``relabeled'' if it is simply a repackaged and rebranded version of a formulation
which is already registered by another manufacturer and is procured from that manufacturer for sale or use. Requiring
companies which sell relabeled products to conduct the testing program in today's rulemaking would clearly duplicate
the efforts of the original manufacturer. Thus, under the authority of CAA section 211(e)(3)(C), which provides
that the Administrator may ``exempt any person from such regulations with respect to a particular fuel or fuel additive
upon a finding that any additional testing of such fuel or fuel additive would be duplicative of adequate existing
testing,'' today's rule includes a special provision exempting relabeled products from the evaluation and testing
requirements. For relabeled products, only basic registration information will be required, as described below
in Section XII.A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About half of the 4,800 fuel additives registered (as of March 1994) are relabeled products. Manufacturers of these
relabeled products will therefore not be required to comply with the health and welfare effects assessment provisions
of the F/FA registration program.

C. Aerosols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested an exemption for aftermarket aerosol additives because of the nature of their mode
of application and their low frequency of use. EPA examined available data on aerosol products and concluded that
the required testing procedures of this rule are not well suited to this type of product. The evaluation of currently
registered additives indicates that aerosols include carburetor cleaners and engine starters that are sprayed
into the air intake valve of the engine and are used only intermittently and, even then, for only a very brief period
of time (i.e., a few seconds). Because of their intermittent use and method of use, it is unlikely that their recommended
application would affect the overall characteristics of vehicle emissions. Direct exposure to the aerosol product
itself is likely to be a more important source of potential hazards than is exposure to its combustion or evaporative
emission products. Thus, the evaluation of potential health and welfare effects of aerosols would require a different
testing regimen tailored to the specific nature of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule therefore establishes a special provision for aerosols. Manufacturers of aftermarket aerosol additives
are required to provide only the basic registration data required for all F/FA manufacturers (see Section XII.A),
plus a literature survey of existing information on their products and a discussion on the potential exposures. Thus,
the standard emission characterization and Tier 2 tests are not required for aerosol products. The literature search
(as described in Section VII.A) must include existing data on potential health and welfare effects on the uncombusted
aerosol product as a whole and on the individual components of the product. The analysis of potential exposures should
be based on the total annual production volume data and the market distribution of the product, as explained in Section
VII.C. EPA will review the submitted information and will determine if there is a need to require testing on a case-by-case
basis. Thus, if testing of an aerosol is prescribed by EPA, the testing is to be performed under Tier 3. Using this approach,
EPA will be able to tailor specific tests (as needed) addressing the particular problems related to aerosol product
exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA requested comments on the possibility of establishing special provisions for small businesses.
The regulated industry expressed concerns regarding the costs of the program and the potential impact of the F/FA
regulations on the financial status of small companies. EPA understands that small businesses might be particularly
affected by the F/FA regulations due to their smaller resource base, generally lower rate of representation in trade
organizations and, consequently, their potentially limited opportunity to participate in grouping and cost-sharing
arrangements. In view of these circumstances, EPA is including in today's rule special provisions to alleviate the
economic impact of this rule on small manufacturers of F/FAs, taking into consideration the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA examined the distribution of currently registered F/FA companies across various sales ranges and identified
a sales level which will define a ``small business'' for the purposes of this rule. A comparison between registered
fuel manufacturers and registered additive manufacturers indicates that the distribution across sales ranges
is similar for both industries. Each industry appears to be made up of many small companies and relatively few larger
companies. Approximately a fifth of registered fuel manufacturers and a third of registered additive manufacturers
have sales above $100 million. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both industries, most of the companies with sales under $100 million tend to cluster under $50 million. Thus, within
each of the industries, companies tend to cluster above $100 million and below $50 million in sales. Furthermore,
companies with sales below $50 million also tend to have sales below $10 million, especially within the additive industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the analysis of F/FA manufacturers' sales data, EPA identified $50 million as a reasonable sales level for
differentiating between small and large companies within each industry.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, this final rule defines a small business as any motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive manufacturer with total
annual sales of less than $50 million.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 The small business provisions established for this rule are defined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases where subsidiary, divisional, or other complex business arrangements exist, the business entity to which
this sales level pertains is the parent company with ultimate ownership. The ``ultimate'' parent is defined as the
uppermost headquarters or topmost company encompassing all related parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches,
or other operating units. This definition follows that used by the Small Business Administration. It also helps to
ensure that companies will not subdivide merely to become eligible for the small business provisions of this program.

``Total annual sales'' means the average of the manufacturer's sales revenue in each of the previous three years (i.e.,
the three years prior to the submittal of the supplemental notification form required under this rule).

Special provisions for small
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
F/FA companies were developed based on assumptions regarding the degree to which manufacturers will have the opportunity
to group with other manufacturers to share costs, and the degree to which information on similar products can be expected
to be submitted by larger companies. A review of EPA's registration data base shows that nearly every registered F/FA
manufacturer produces at least one baseline or non-baseline product. Hence, even if generous special provisions
are provided for small manufacturers of these products, EPA is assured that test data on such products will still be
submitted by other, larger companies which do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for the special provisions. Therefore, in regard to registration of products in the baseline and non-baseline
categories, this final rule requires small businesses (i.e., companies with annual sales less than $50 million)
to submit only the basic registration data for their baseline and/or non-baseline products. Such companies are not
required to meet the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements in order to register their baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. Since
the larger companies will still be submitting the data for these products, this provision does not compromise EPA's
ability to get the necessary information to evaluate the potential health and welfare effects of baseline and non-baseline
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above assumption, however, is not valid in the case of atypical F/FAs. Analysis of current registrations shows
that there are fewer atypical products than baseline products and fewer large companies that produce atypical F/FAs.
Therefore, if the same small business provisions described above for baseline/non-baseline F/FAs were also applied
to atypical F/FAs, then there would be no data submitted for many atypical F/FAs. EPA would then be unable to evaluate
the health and welfare effects for these atypical products. Nevertheless, EPA realizes that the testing program
will be particularly burdensome for very small manufacturers of atypical F/FAs. In part, this is due to the added compliance
requirements for atypical products (e.g., more rigorous mileage accumulation requirements prior to emission generation
(see Section VI.E) and more extensive emission characterization requirements (see Section VII.B). An even greater
impact results from the fact that grouping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities for these manufacturers might be quite limited. Not only do atypical products tend to be unique, but
also, the smallest manufacturers rarely are members of the dominant trade associations which are most likely to take
the lead in organizing and administering F/FA group functions. Thus, high program costs could fall on manufacturers
with low financial resources and perhaps few opportunities to share the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above reasons, this final rule includes additional special provisions applicable to the atypical F/FAs
of small businesses. However, these provisions apply to fewer manufacturers and are less liberal than those established
for baseline and non- baseline products. Specifically, for manufacturers of atypical products with less than $10
million in annual sales (rather than the $50 million sales level applicable to manufacturers of baseline/non-baseline
F/FAs), the minimal requirements of the program include only basic registration and Tier 1 data. These requirements
fall between those applicable to small manufacturers of baseline/non-baseline F/FAs and the general requirements
of the program for larger manufacturers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, manufacturers qualifying for small business special provisions for their baseline and non-baseline
products (having less than $50 million annual sales) are excused from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements, while small
manufacturers qualifying for special provisions for their atypical products (having less than $10 million annual
sales) are excused only from Tier 2 requirements for these products. Since small business provisions are based on
both the annual sales and the product category, the possibility exists for a manufacturer to have some products excused
from program requirements while having to comply with testing requirements for others. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, an additive manufacturer having both baseline and atypical products and annual sales of $30 million can
use the special small business provision for the baseline additives, but not for the atypical products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to CAA section 211(b), 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FAs which are excused from any program requirements under these special provisions may still be subject to testing
under Tier 3 at EPA's discretion (on a case-by-case basis). The Tier 3 testing might include (but would not be necessarily
limited to) information which would otherwise have been required under the provisions of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2.

XI. Timing and Compliance Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The timing and compliance requirements for the F/FA registration program are dependent on the type of product and
the registration status of the product. As discussed in Section III.A of this preamble, both Tier 1 and Tier 2 are mandatory
requirements for all F/FAs (or groups), except as may be modified by any applicable special provisions. Special provisions
affecting the content and/or timing of these requirements are discussed in Sections VII.A.3, VIII.D, and X of this
preamble. For F/FAs registered as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this rule, Tier 1 data and evidence of a suitable contractual arrangement for satisfactory completion
of Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA within three years of the effective date. The results of Tier 2 must be
submitted to EPA no later than six years from the effective date. The schedule for completion of any Tier 3 requirements
which EPA may prescribe will be determined based on the nature of the particular requirements. The general reporting
format for submittal of all of these requirements is described in Section XII. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For registrable F/FAs, i.e., F/FAs not registered as of the effective date of this rule but meeting the criteria for
grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive in the same fuel family, the content and timing of requirements
is essentially the same as for the currently registered F/FAs. Thus, manufacturers of these products will be granted
registration and be permitted to market registrable F/FAs upon EPA's receipt of basic registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for such products. In contrast, for manufacturers of new F/FAs (i.e., F/FAs that are not currently registered
and do not meet the registrable criteria), all testing requirements must be completed prior to registration and introduction
into commerce, including Tier 3 when prescribed by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receipt of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data, EPA will determine whether the submitted information is in compliance with
the specified guidelines and whether further testing of a particular fuel or fuel additive is required under the provisions
of Tier 3. For registered F/FAs, EPA intends to determine the adequacy of the submitted data within two years after
receipt. However, if EPA is unable to inform the registered manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2
data within two years after submittal, EPA retains the authority to require that satisfactory data be submitted if,
upon subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review, EPA finds that the original submittal was inadequate for compliance. In such a case, EPA will not hold the manufacturer
liable for penalties for violating this rule from the time period between the date on which the data were due and the
date on which EPA informs the responsible manufacturer of a violation. Regarding new F/FAs, EPA will send a notification
of compliance within six months after submission of Tier 1 and Tier 2 data. If the manufacturer of the new F/FA product
does not receive a notification of compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 within this time frame, then the manufacturer should
assume that the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactorily met. EPA's determination of the need for Tier 3 testing for new F/FAs will occur within six months after
EPA notifies the manufacturer of satisfactory compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements or within twelve months
of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal, whichever occurs first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If Tier 3 testing is deemed necessary, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified letter
of the specific Tier 3 requirement(s) along with a schedule for compliance and a deadline for submittal of the Tier
3 report to EPA (see Section IX.A). This final rule gives the responsible manufacturer (or group) 60 days to comment
on the prescribed Tier 3 requirements, compliance schedule, and submission deadline. In the event that EPA receives
no comment within the given period, the manufacturer will be assumed to have consented in full to the prescribed Tier
3 requirements. Compliance with Tier 3 requirements is not optional.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Registered (and registrable) F/FAs required to undergo Tier 3 testing will retain their registration for that time
determined to be necessary for the completion of Tier 3 tests. This registration will be contingent on the satisfactory
compliance with the Tier 3 requirements according to a timetable determined by EPA to be appropriate to those requirements.
When Tier 3 is prescribed for new F/FAs (i.e., those not meeting the registrable criteria), EPA may withhold registration
until completion of all testing requirements. For new F/FAs, EPA will determine whether the Tier 3 requirements have
been met within one year of receiving the Tier 3 submittal. If Tier 3 requirements are satisfied, then EPA will send
a notification to the manufacturer granting registration to the new F/FA product. Registration of new F/FAs will
not occur until that time when EPA determines that all Tier 3 requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, EPA's review times for data on new F/FAs are shorter than those for registered F/FAs. The reason
for this discrepancy is that manufacturers of new F/FAs are barred from marketing such products until EPA approves
their compliance with all testing requirements and grants them registration. On the other hand, manufacturers of
registered products can maintain their registration, and thus their ability to sell their products, while EPA is
reviewing their submitted data. Thus, to ensure that undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hindrance is not created for manufacturers of new products wanting to enter the marketplace, EPA has abbreviated
the review times for new F/FA products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the granting of a registration (or continued registration for registered F/FAs), if EPA determines
that a fuel or fuel additive causes or contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
the public health or welfare, then EPA could invoke available regulatory authority under CAA section 211(c). Referral
to Tier 3 is not required for EPA to begin a regulatory action under 211(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If additional testing is needed to make up for deficiencies in information content or testing technique/procedures
related to Tier 1, Tier 2, and/or Tier 3, then the original compliance deadlines will still be in force. Manufacturers
of existing products who fail to submit data in the prescribed time frames or who submit data from tests that do not comply
with the specified guidelines will be in violation of this rule and will be subject to the penalties specified in CAA
section 211(d). According to CAA section 211(d), persons who fail to submit any information or conduct any tests required
by the Administrator under CAA section 211(b) shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than
$25,000 for every day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such violation plus the amount of economic benefit or savings resulting from the violation. Each day after the due
date for submission of data will constitute a separate day of violation. Civil penalties will be assessed in accordance
with CAA sections 205(b) and (c), which permit EPA to proceed either in court or in an administrative action. If a group
of manufacturers commits to performing joint testing, each manufacturer would separately be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of the rule. However, the Administrator would retain the authority to remit or mitigate any penalty under
CAA section 211(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above penalties, the district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to compel the furnishing
of information and/or the conduct of tests required under CAA section 211(b). This means that, in addition to the financial
penalties, persons failing to submit data or comply with the specified guidelines would still need to submit the data
originally required. Furthermore, if EPA determines that the data requirements of the rule were not met, EPA could
revoke the registration of the fuel(s) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive(s) in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA recognizes that unusual circumstances, outside the control of the manufacturer, may occasionally interfere
with the manufacturer's ability to comply with the provisions of the rule, today's rule contains a mechanism to allow
manufacturers to request modification of the requirements under some specific circumstances. This special mechanism
allows persons who experience unforeseen problems or accidents in conducting the EPA-prescribed tests to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request modification of the requirements in order to avoid being in violation of the rule. This mechanism would apply
to unusual mechanical problems or other unavoidable problems that could arise during the performance of the required
tests. The modification requests must be submitted as soon as the manufacturer is aware of the difficulty, but not
later than thirty days following the event precipitating the request. Additional details on this special mechanism
for modification of requirements is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory text of this rule.

XII. Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The materials to be submitted to EPA include the basic registration data, a summary report with Tier 1 and Tier 2 results,
and associated appendices. If the results of Tiers 1 and 2 are submitted at the same time, then the summary report must
include both Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and associated appendices, as described below. If Tier 1 and Tier 2 results
are submitted separately, then two individual reports must be provided to EPA, i.e., Tier 1 report and Tier 2 report.
In such a case, each individual report must include the summary information applicable to the respective tier (including
a cover page, executive summary, test substance information, a summary of tier results, conclusions, and associated
appendices). If the Tier 2 report for registered F/FAs is not submitted within three years after the effective date
of the final rule, then evidence of a suitable arrangement for completion of Tier 2 (e.g., a copy of a signed contract
with a qualified laboratory to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct the required Tier 2 tests) must be submitted to EPA prior to that date. F/FA manufacturers who must conduct
additional testing under Tier 3 are required to submit a Tier 3 report when the designated Tier 3 testing is complete.
The nature of the information to be included in the basic registration data, reports, and associated appendices is
described below.

A. Basic Registration Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic information already required for F/FA registration includes product and manufacturer identification,
concentration and purpose-in-use, and specific compositional data. Today's rule adds the following items to the
basic registration data requirements: total annual production volume data, marketing distribution data, notification
about group participation, and notification on the use of special provisions (i.e., relabeled products, aerosols,
and small business, as discussed in Section X). Manufacturers of F/FAs registered as of the effective date of this
rule must submit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional basic registration data items to EPA within six months of that date. Other manufacturers are strongly
encouraged to submit the basic registration data prior to starting the evaluation tiers (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, and/or
Tier 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production volume information is to be reported in units of gallons per year for F/FA products that are generally
sold in liquid form and kilograms per year for F/FA products that are generally sold in solid form. For F/FAs already
in production, the submitted figure must reflect the most recent annual period as well as the volume projected to be
produced in the third subsequent year. For products not yet in production, the best estimate of expected total production
volume during the third year of production must be provided. Market distribution data for each product must also be
provided. For fuels and bulk additives, the distribution data must be reported as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of total annual sales volume marketed in each Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD), as defined
in &sect;79.59(b)(3) of this rule. For aftermarket additives, the distribution data must be reported as the percent
of total annual sales volume marketed in each state. For products not yet in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, the manufacturer must report projected distribution data by PADD or state, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of F/FAs registered as of the effective date of this rule who intend to comply with registration requirements
as part of a group must identify the person or entity which is organizing the testing for the applicable group. Similarly,
if an applicant is relying on another manufacturer's (or group's) previous registration materials in compliance
with the testing requirements for an unregistered product, then the other manufacturer or group must be identified.
In addition, the manufacturer of the unregistered product must provide evidence that the original submitter has
been notified and that reimbursement will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic registration data must be submitted (or resubmitted) individually for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 product being registered, using EPA forms which are in effect at the time of the submittal. This requirement pertains
to all F/FA products registered as of the effective date of this rule, including relabeled products, as well as those
for which first-time registration is sought after promulgation of this rule. If the basic registration data previously
submitted for a currently registered fuel or additive is accurate and complete, then a statement asserting that this
is so will suffice in lieu of the submittal of duplicate information. A finding by EPA that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is not, in fact, accurate and complete as claimed will result in the report being considered inadequate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fuel manufacturer may at any time modify an existing fuel registration by submitting a request to EPA to add or delete
a bulk additive to the existing registration information for such fuel product, provided that any additional additive
must be registered by EPA for use in the specific fuel family to which the fuel product belongs. The addition or deletion
of a bulk additive to a fuel registration does not necessarily cause the fuel to be considered ``new''. However, if
the change affects the grouping of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered fuel, it may affect the testing responsibilities of the fuel manufacturer.

This report will provide a summary of the evaluation procedures, results, and conclusions, pertaining to Tier 1 and/or

 References used to support Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 conclusions must be cited in the report. A cover page must be included,
identifying the test substance, the manufacturer's name and address, a designated contact person and phone number,
and grouping information (if applicable). The grouping information must identify the group name or grouping criteria,
all products and manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which the report pertains, and the name and address of the responsible organization or entity reporting for the
group. The body of the summary report must be divided into the following sections.

An appendix is also required for each of the tests conducted in compliance with Tier 2 requirements. These appendices
must contain the full detailed study protocol, complete laboratory report, statistical analysis of the findings,
and scientific conclusions. These materials must conform to the reporting requirements of the individual study
guidelines as well as the general standards for recordkeeping and reporting specified in the GLP standards of this
final rule (see &sect;79.60). A final appendix must be provided, containing laboratory certifications and associated
personnel credentials.

E. Confidential Business Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) states that the results of tests ``conducted in conformity with test procedures and protocols
established by the Administrator,'' pursuant to CAA section 211(b)(2)(A), shall not be considered confidential.
Thus, health and welfare information supplied to EPA in compliance with Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 testing requirements
will be made available to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers (or groups) claiming business confidentiality on any information submitted under the F/FA testing
program must make a claim of confidentiality in writing at the time of submittal of the reporting requirements. To
assert a business confidentiality claim the submitter must clearly mark the confidential information and must submit
a separate document setting forth the claim and listing each location at which the confidential information appears
in the submitted data. If any person subsequently requests access to the test data submitted under the F/FA testing
program (other than health and welfare effects information) and such information is subject to a claim of business
confidentiality, the request and any subsequent disclosure will be governed by the provisions of 40 CFR part 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and
therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order.
The Order defines ``economically significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulatory support document which presents EPA's analysis of the cost impacts of this final rule is available for
review in the public docket (A&hyph;90&hyph;07). EPA estimates that the costs to industry for submittal of the requisite
data for Tiers 1 and 2 would total approximately $66 million, assumed to be incurred over the first three-year period
after promulgation of this final rule. Thus, the average annual cost during this period would be about $22 million.
In the subsequent three years, Tier 3 requirements might cost an additional $1 million annually, per product or group.
If ten products or groups were required to conduct Tier 3 testing in the three-year period following the initial compliance
period, the cost would be $10 million per year. These projected overall costs are far less than the $100 million annual
cost criterion which is a major determinant in defining an ``economically significant regulatory action.'' In addition,
this final rule is not expected to adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not ``economically significant'' based on the above criteria, this final rule is still considered a ``significant
regulatory action'' pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866 and was thus submitted to OMB for review. Any written
comments from OMB and any EPA response to OMB's comments are available in the public docket for this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Administrator is required to assess the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of regulatory actions on small businesses. Accordingly, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) has been prepared for this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is presented as part of the Regulatory Support Document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(available in the public docket). The RFA compares the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of this rule on small F/FA manufacturers to the impacts on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large F/FA manufacturers. The analysis explains the small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition specifically developed in this rule to provide special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions for small F/FA manufacturers (see Section X.D) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assesses the effectiveness of these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule defines a small business as any motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or fuel additive manufacturer with total annual sales of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than $50 million. A comparison of companies classified as small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this definition to those classified as small by the Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business Administration (SBA) reveals that the F/FA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition classifies a larger number of F/FA manufacturers as small, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and more closely groups companies with similar financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics. Based on this analysis, EPA determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small business definition established in this rule is reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to the F/FA industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impacts of this rule on F/FA manufacturers were determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projecting the effects of the estimated compliance costs on each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company's return on assets (ROA). In general, a reduction in ROA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(after compliance costs) to less than 2.5 percent is indicative of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial distress. A ROA less than ^4 percent indicates that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company is in severe financial distress, and a ROA less than ^30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent generally indicates closure. According to these ROA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thresholds, results of the RFA show that approximately 68 unique F/FA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers (43 additive manufacturers, 23 fuel manufacturers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 that produce both fuels and additives) could potentially be pushed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into some level of financial distress. All of these companies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as small (i.e., have sales less than $50 million). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of these companies would fall into the first level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial distress; however, less than one-fifth of them (12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies) would potentially be in danger of closure. In relation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total population of F/FA manufacturers, the companies potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falling into some level of financial distress account to about six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, with about 1.2 percent potentially in danger of closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously described, this final rule includes two types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special provisions for small businesses. With respect to baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and non-baseline F/FAs, all small manufacturers (i.e., annual sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under $50 million) are excused from all Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. A segment of these small manufacturers, i.e., those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having sales under $10 million, are also excused from Tier 2 testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for their atypical F/FAs. Nevertheless, all twelve of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturers who are projected to be in danger of closure as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of this rule are very small companies with one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical F/FAs. The RFA analysis shows that the special provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for small manufacturers with atypical products lowers overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance costs for 60 such manufacturers by roughly $20 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as compared with costs that would otherwise occur in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of this special provision). Without this provision, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional 15 manufacturers of atypical products would potentially be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pushed into closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the RFA has assumed no changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices, sales, product mix, or financial strategies. In many cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a portion of regulatory costs can be actually passed on to consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or back to suppliers. Manufacturers also have the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulating a product to a ``baseline'' standard which has much lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance costs, or even of dropping products with the greatest cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smallest profit potential. A more detailed discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances which could mitigate compliance cost impacts is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in the RFA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overview of requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) All manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated for registration under this part are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the requirements of subpart F of this part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either on an individual basis or as a participant in a group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of the same or similar fuels and fuel additives, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;79.56. If manufacturers elect to comply by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individually subject to the requirements of subpart F of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, and responsible for testing under this subpart. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer, subject to the provisions for group applications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.51(b) and the special provisions in &sect;79.58, shall submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all Tier 1 and Tier 2 information required by &sect;&sect;79.52, 79.53 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.59 for each fuel or additive, except that the Tier 1 emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization requirements in &sect;79.52(b) and/or the Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing requirements in &sect;79.53 may be satisfied by adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing information pursuant to the Tier 1 literature search 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in &sect;79.52(d). The adequacy of existing information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to serve in compliance with specific Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements shall be determined according to the criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures specified in &sect;&sect;79.52(b) and 79.53 (c) and (d). In all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, EPA reserves the right to require, based upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information contained in the application or any other information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the Agency, that manufacturers conduct additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of any fuel or additive (or fuel/additive group) if EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that there is inadequate information upon which to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base regulatory decisions for such product(s). In any case where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA determines that the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied but that further testing is required, the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3 (&sect;79.54) shall apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Laboratory facilities shall perform testing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those requirements apply to inhalation toxicology studies. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies shall be monitored by the facilities' Quality Assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units (as specified in &sect;79.60). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Group Applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to the provisions of &sect;79.56 (a) through (c), EPA will consider any testing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this subpart to have been met for any fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when a fuel or fuel additive which meets the criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has met that testing requirement, provided that all fuels and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives must be individually registered as described in &sect;79.59(b). For purposes of this subpart, a determination
of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group contains a particular fuel or additive will be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the provisions of &sect;79.56 (d) and (e). Nothing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subsection (b) shall be deemed to require a manufacturer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rely on another manufacturer's testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

(A) Within May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements must be submitted to EPA, pursuant to &sect;&sect;79.52, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.53, and 79.59; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Within May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(pursuant to &sect;&sect;79.52 and 79.59), plus evidence of a contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) In the case of such fuels and fuel additives which, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to applicable special provisions in &sect;79.58, are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to Tier 2 requirements, all other requirements (except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3) must be submitted to EPA before May 27, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In the event that Tier 3 testing is also required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(under &sect;79.54), EPA shall determine an appropriate timeline for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of the additional requirements and shall communicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this schedule to the manufacturer according to the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.54(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The manufacturer may at any time modify an existing fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration by submitting a request to EPA to add or delete a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulk additive to the existing registration information for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel product, provided that any additional additive must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered by EPA for use in the specific fuel family to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel product belongs. However, the addition or deletion of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulk additive to a fuel registration may effect the grouping of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such registered fuel under the criteria of &sect;79.56, and thus may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect the testing responsibilities of the fuel manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this subpart.

(i) A fuel product which is not registered pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart B of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registrable if, under the criteria established by &sect;79.56, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel can be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more currently registered fuels. A fuel additive product which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not registered for a specific type of fuel pursuant to subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered registrable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for that type of fuel if, under the criteria established by &sect;

the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered fuels or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, currently registered fuels and bulk additives are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those with existing registrations as of the date on which EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives the basic registration data (pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A manufacturer seeking to register under subpart B of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part a fuel product which is deemed registrable under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, or to register under subpart C of this part a fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive product for a specific type of fuel for which it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed registrable under this section, shall submit the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration data (pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)) for that product as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the application for registration. If the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that the product is registrable under this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then the Administrator shall promptly register the product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the applicant has satisfied all of the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for registration under subpart B or subpart C of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part, and contingent upon satisfactory submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required information under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Registration of a registrable fuel or additive shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to the same requirements and compliance schedule as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for existing fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fuel additives. Accordingly, manufacturers of registrable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels or additives may be granted and may retain registration for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such products only if any applicable and due Tier 1, 2, and 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements have also been satisfied by either the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product or the fuel/additive group to which the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belongs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New fuels and fuel additives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fuel product shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered new if it is not registered pursuant to subpart B of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part as of May 27, 1994 and if, under the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by &sect;79.56, it cannot be enrolled in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fuel additive product shall be considered new with respect to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific type of fuel if it is not expressly registered for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of fuel pursuant to subpart C of this part as of May 27, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 and if, under the criteria established by &sect;79.56, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the specific type of fuel cannot be enrolled in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently registered fuels and bulk additives are those with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing registrations as of the date on which EPA receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic registration data (pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)) for the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in question. For such new product, the manufacturer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactorily complete all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, followed by any Tier 3 testing which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may require, before registration will be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notifications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group's) submittal in compliance with the requirements of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart, EPA will notify such manufacturer (or group) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been received and what, if any, information, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, or retesting is necessary to bring the application into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirements of this subpart. EPA intends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide such notification of receipt in a timely manner for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each such application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Registered fuel and fuel additive notification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product who is notified that the submittal for such product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains adequate information pursuant to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and reporting requirements (&sect;&sect;79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (c)) may continue to sell, offer for sale, or introduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into commerce the registered product as permitted by the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration for the product under &sect;79.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive product is notified that testing or retesting is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to bring the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, the continued sale or importation of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be conditional upon satisfactorily completing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) EPA intends to notify the manufacturer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the submitted data within two years of EPA's receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such data. However, EPA retains the right to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate data be submitted to EPA if, upon subsequent review, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds that the original Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the requirements of this subpart. If EPA does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 data within two years, EPA will not hold the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for penalties for violating this rule for the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning when the data was due until the time EPA notifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer of the violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive product is notified (pursuant to &sect;79.54(b)) that Tier 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing is required for its product, then the manufacturer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to sell, offer for sale, introduce into commerce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered product as permitted by the existing registration for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product under &sect;79.4. However, if the manufacturer fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the specified Tier 3 requirements within the specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the registration of the product will be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation under &sect;79.51(f)(6).

New fuel and fuel additive notification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Within six months following its receipt of the Tier 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Tier 2 submittal for a new product (as defined in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(3) of this section), EPA shall notify the manufacturer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of such submittal in compliance with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) through (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If EPA notifies the manufacturer that testing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retesting, or additional information is necessary to bring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal into compliance, the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall remedy all inadequacies and provide Tier 3 data, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required, before EPA shall consider the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration to have been met for the product in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal within six months following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submittal, the manufacturer shall be deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactorily completed Tiers 1 and 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Within six months of the date on which EPA notifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer of satisfactory completion of Tiers 1 and 2 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new product, or within one year of the submittal of the Tier 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Tier 2 data (whichever is earlier), EPA shall determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether additional testing is currently needed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of Tier 3 and, pursuant to &sect;79.54(b), shall notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer of its determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the manufacturer of a new fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is notified that Tier 3 testing is required for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, then EPA shall have the authority to withhold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration until the specified Tier 3 requirements have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactorily completed. EPA shall determine whether the Tier 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements have been met, and shall notify the manufacturer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this determination, within one year of receiving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's Tier 3 submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3 requirements within the prescribed timeframe, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional testing at the Tier 3 level is deemed currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary and the manufacturer shall be considered to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complied with all current registration requirements for the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or additive product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Upon completion of all current Tier 1, Tier 2, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3 requirements, and submission of an application for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration which includes all of the information and assurances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by &sect;79.11 or &sect;79.21, the registration of the new fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or additive shall be granted, and the registrant may then sell, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer for sale, or introduce into commerce the registered product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as permitted by &sect;79.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Once the new product becomes registered, EPA reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to require additional Tier 3 testing pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures specified in &sect;79.54. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspection of a testing facility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A testing facility, emissions analysis or health and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welfare effects, shall permit an authorized employee or duly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated representative of EPA, at reasonable times and in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable manner, to inspect the facility and to inspect (and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of records also to copy) all records and specimens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be maintained regarding studies to which this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies. The records inspection and copying requirements shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems, or to actions recommended and taken, except the EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seek production of these records in litigation or informal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a test substance does or does not present a risk of injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to health or the environment any data developed by a testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with this section. The determination that a study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor of a required test of any obligation under any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.

(3) Effects of non-compliance. Pursuant to sections 114, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
208, and 211(d) of the CAA, it shall be a violation of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section and a violation of 40 CFR part 79, subpart F to deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry to an authorized employee or duly designated representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of EPA for the purpose of auditing a testing facility or test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Penalties and Injunctive Relief. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Any person who violates these regulations shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each and every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of the continuance of the violation and the economic benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or savings resulting from the violation. Action to collect such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil penalties shall be commenced in accordance with paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) of section 205 of the Clean Air Act or assessed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with paragraph (c) of section 205 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7524 (b) and (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Under section 205(b) of the CAA, the Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commence a civil action for violation of this subpart in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
district court of the United States for the district in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the defendant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resides or has a principal place of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Under section 205(c) of the CAA, the Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess a civil penalty of $25,000 for each and every day of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuance of the violation and the economic benefit or savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the violation, except that the maximum penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator and the Attorney General shall not be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Administrator may, upon application by the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against whom any such penalty has been assessed, remit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate, with or without conditions, any such penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The district courts of the United States shall have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction to compel the furnishing of information and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct of tests required by the Administrator under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and to award other appropriate relief. Actions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compel such actions shall be brought by and in the name of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are required to attend a district court in any district may run 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into any other district. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Administrator of EPA may issue a notice of intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cancel a fuel or fuel additive registration if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator determines that the registrant has failed to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a timely manner any data required to maintain registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this part or under section 211(b) or 211(e) of the Clean

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Upon issuance of a notice of intent to cancel, EPA will forward a copy of the notice to the registrant by certified
mail, return receipt requested, at the address of record given in the registration, along with an explanation of the
reasons for the proposed cancellation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The registrant will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel to submit written
comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific data requirements which
provide the basis for the proposed cancellation. If the registrant does not respond in writing within 60 days from
the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the cancellation of the registration shall become final by operation
of law and the Administrator shall notify the registrant of such cancellation. If the registrant responds in writing
within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the Administrator shall review and consider
all comments submitted by the registrant before taking final action concerning the proposed cancellation. The registrants'
communications should be sent to the following address: Director, Field Operations and Support Division, 6406J_Fuel/Additives
Registration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to cancel, a registrant may request an informal hearing concerning
the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the registrant wishes to present at such
a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 60 days from the date of receipt
of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether
or not the registrant has complied with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed cancellation.
If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall
be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim
transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator shall consider all relevant evidence and
arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed cancellation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If a registrant who has received a notice of intent to cancel submits a timely written response, and the Administrator
decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to cancel the registration, the Administrator
shall issue a final cancellation order, forward a copy of the cancellation order to the registrant by certified mail,
and promptly publish the cancellation order in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Modification of Regulation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In special circumstances, a manufacturer subject to the registration requirements of this rule may petition
the Administrator to modify the mandatory testing requirements in the test standard for any test required by this
rule by application to Director, Field Operations and Support Division, at the address in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)
of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Such request shall be made as soon as the test sponsor is aware that the modification is necessary, but in no event
shall the request be made after 30 days following the event which precipitated the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Upon such request, the Administrator may, in circumstances which are outside the control of the manufacturer(s)
or his/their agent and which could not have been reasonably foreseen or avoided, modify the mandatory testing requirements
in the rule if such requirements are infeasible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the Administrator determines that such modifications would not significantly alter the scope of the test,
EPA will not ask for public comment before approving the modification. The Administrator will notify the test sponsor
by certified mail of the response to the request. EPA will place copies of each application and EPA response in the public
docket. EPA will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice is published, any modification approved by EPA shall apply only to the person or group who requested the modification;
EPA shall state the applicability of each modification in such notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of a test standard would significantly change the scope

Special Requirements for Additives.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An additive which is a direct test subject, either because it is the chosen representative of a group or because it is
not a member of a group, is subject to the following rules:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All required emission characterization and health effects testing procedures shall be performed on the mixture
which results when the additive is combined with the base fuel for the appropriate fuel family (as specified in &sect;79.55)
at the maximum concentration recommended by the additive manufacturer pursuant to &sect;79.21(d). This combination
shall be known as the additive/base fuel mixture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The appropriate fuel family to be utilized for the additive/base fuel mixture is the fuel family which contains
the specific type(s) of fuel for which the additive is presently registered or for which the manufacturer of the additive
is seeking registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fuels and additives belonging to more than one fuel family.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If a fuel or additive product is registered in two or more fuel families as of May 27, 1994, then the manufacturer
of that product is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing of) each formulation in compliance
with the requirements of this subpart for each fuel family in which the manufacturer wishes to maintain a product registration
for its fuel or additive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If a fuel or additive manufacturer is seeking to register such product in two or more fuel families, then the product
shall be considered, for testing and registration purposes, to be a member of each fuel family in which the manufacturer
is seeking registration. The manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing of) each
formulation in compliance with the requirements of this subpart for each fuel family in which the manufacturer wishes
to obtain a product registration for its fuel or additive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of the methanol fuel family, which contains two base fuels (M100 and M85 base fuels, pursuant to &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.55(d)), the applicable base fuel is the one which represents the fuel/additive group (specified in &sect;79.56(e)(4)(i)(C))
containing fuels of which the most gallons are sold annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Aftermarket additives which are intended by the manufacturer to be added to the fuel tank only at infrequent intervals
shall be applied according to the manufacturer's specifications during mileage accumulation, pursuant to &sect;79.57(c).
However, during emission generation and testing, each tankful of fuel used must contain the fuel additive at its maximum
recommended level. If the additive manufacturer believes that this maximum treatment rate will cause adverse effects
to the test engine and/or that the engine's emissions may be subject to artifacts due to overuse of the additive, then
the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for modification of this requirement and related test procedures. Such
request must include objective evidence that the modification(s) are needed, along with data demonstrating the
maximum concentration of the additive which may actually reach the fuel tanks of vehicles in use.

are subject to artifacts due to this blending, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a modification in test
procedure requirements to the EPA. Any such request must include supporting test results and suggested test modifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Bulk additives which are used intermittently for the direct purpose of conditioning or treating a fuel during
storage or transport, or for treating or maintaining the storage, pipeline, and/or other components of the fuel distribution
system itself and not the vehicle/engine for which the fuel is ultimately intended, shall, for purposes of this program,
be added to the base fuel at the maximum concentration recommended by the additive manufacturer for treatment of the
fuel or distribution system component. However, if the additive manufacturer believes that this treatment rate
will cause adverse effects to the test engine and/or that the engine's emissions may be subject to artifacts due to
overuse of the additive, then the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for modification of this requirement and
related test procedures. Such request must include objective evidence that the modification(s) are needed, along
with data demonstrating the maximum concentration of the additive which may actually reach the fuel tanks of vehicles
in use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA shall use emissions speciation and health effects data generated in the analysis of the applicable base fuel
as control data for comparison with data generated for the additive/base fuel mixture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The base fuel control data may be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Generated internally as an experimental control in conjunction with testing done in compliance with registration
requirements for a specific additive; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Generated externally in the course of testing different additive(s) belonging to the same fuel family, or in the
testing of a base fuel serving as representative of the baseline group for the respective fuel family pursuant to &sect;79.56(e)(4)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Control data generated using test equipment (including vehicle model and/or engine, or Evaporative Emissions
Generator specifications, as appropriate) and protocols identical or nearly identical to those used in emissions
and health effects testing of the subject additive/base fuel mixture would be most relevant for comparison purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If an additive manufacturer chooses the same vehicle/engine to independently test the base fuel as an experimental
control prior to testing the additive/base fuel mixture, then the test vehicle/engine shall undergo two mileage
accumulation periods, pursuant to &sect;79.57(c). The initial mileage accumulation period shall be performed
using the base fuel alone. After base fuel testing, and prior to testing of the additive/base fuel mixture, a second
mileage accumulation period shall be performed using the additive/base fuel mixture. The procedures outlined in
this paragraph shall not preclude a manufacturer from testing a base fuel and the manufacturer's additive/base fuel
mixture separately in identical, or nearly identical, vehicles/engines.

 (1) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a gasoline
or diesel product meets criteria for classification as a non-baseline product (pursuant to &sect;79.56(e)(3)(i)(B)
or &sect;79.56(e)(3)(ii)(B)), then the manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing)
of a separate formulation for each reported oxygenating compound, specified class of oxygenating compounds, or
other substance which defines a separate non-baseline fuel/additive group pursuant to &sect;79.56(e)(4)(ii)(A)
or (B). For each such substance, testing shall be performed on a mixture of the relevant substance in the appropriate
base fuel, formulated according to the specifications for the corresponding group representatives in &sect;79.56(e)(4)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non-

formulations with less than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen
or more, then the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing of) a baseline gasoline
formulation as well as one or more non-baseline gasoline formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non-
baseline diesel product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses diesel formulations
with less than 1.0 weight percent oxygen as well as diesel formulations with 1.0 weight percent oxygen or more, then
the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing) of a baseline diesel formulation
as well as one or more non-baseline diesel formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When such disparate additive products are for the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose-in-use and are not ordinarily used in the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously, the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing (or participating in the group testing of) a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation for each such additive product. Testing related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each additive product shall be performed on a mixture of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive in the applicable base fuel, as described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g)(1) of this section, or by participation in the costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing the designated representative of the fuel/additive group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which each separate atypical additive product belongs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the disparate additive products are not for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same purpose-in-use, the fuel manufacturer shall nevertheless be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for testing a separate formulation for each such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive product, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, if these additives are not ordinarily blended together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the same commercial formulation of the fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the disparate additive products are ordinarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blended together in the same commercial formulation of the fuel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a single test formulation containing all such simultaneously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used atypical additive products. Alternatively, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility can be satisfied by enrolling such fuel product in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a group which includes other fuel or additive products with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same total combination of atypical elements as that occurring in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel product in question. If the basic registration data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject fuel includes any alternative additives which contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical elements not represented in the test formulation, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel manufacturer is also responsible for testing a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation for each such additional disparate additive product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tier 1 requires manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of designated fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to &sect;79.56) to supply to the Administrator: the identity

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information required under &sect;79.59 and in conformance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements thereof, manufacturers shall provide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the timing provisions of &sect;79.51(c), the following

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emissions Characterization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers must provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a characterization of the emission products which are generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by evaporation (if required pursuant to &sect;79.58(b)) and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in a motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle. For this purpose, manufacturers may perform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization procedures described in this section or may rely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on existing emission characterization data. To be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate in lieu of performing new emission characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, the data must be the result of tests using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product in question or using a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the same grouping criteria as the product in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the emissions must be generated in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably similar to those described in &sect;79.57, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization procedures must be adequately performed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented and must give results reasonably comparable to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would be obtained by performing the procedures described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herein. Reports of previous tests must be sufficiently detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions. After the manufacturer's submittal of such data, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that the manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, then the manufacturer will not be considered to be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance until the corresponding tests have been conducted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the results submitted to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The emissions to be characterized shall be generated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected, and stored according to the processes described in &sect;79.57. Characterization of combustion and
evaporative emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be performed separately on each emission sample collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the applicable emission generation procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As provided in &sect;79.57(d), if the emission generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle/engine is ordinarily equipped with an emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aftertreatment device, then all requirements in this section for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the characterization of combustion emissions must be completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both with and without the aftertreatment device in a functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state. The emissions shall be generated three times (on three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different days) without a functional aftertreatment device and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if applicable, three times (on three different days) with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Measurement of background emissions. It is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical species present at the time of emission sampling (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical species profiles be reported with emissions speciation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. Background chemical species measurement/analysis during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FTP is specified in &sect;&sect;86.109&hyph;94(c)(5) and 86.135&hyph;94 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Characterization of the combustion emissions shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, for products in all fuel families (except when expressly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted in this section): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determination of the concentration of the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions as follows: total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nitrogen, and particulates. Manufacturers are referred to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle certification procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subparts B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and D (&sect;&sect;86.101 through 86.145 and &sect;&sect;86.301 through 86.348) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on the measurement of the basic emissions of interest to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Characterization of the vapor phase of combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Determination of the identity and concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual species of hydrocarbon compounds containing 12 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer carbon atoms. Such characterization shall begin within 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes after emission collection is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Determination of the identity and concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual species of aldehyde and ketone compounds containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight or fewer carbon atoms. Characterization of these emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captured in cartridges shall be performed within two weeks if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cartridge is stored at room temperature, and one month if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cartridge is stored at 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C or less. If the emissions are sampled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the impinger method, the sample must be stored in a capped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample vial at 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C or less and characterized within one week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Determination of the identity and concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual species of alcohol and ether compounds containing six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or fewer carbon atoms, for those fuels and additive/base fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixtures which contain alcohol and/or ether compounds containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from one to six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state. For fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and additive formulations containing alcohols or ethers with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state, alcohol and ether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species with that higher number of carbon atoms or less must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and measured in the emissions. Such characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall begin within four hours after emission collection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Characterization of the semi-volatile and particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phases of combustion emissions to identify and measure polycyclic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aromatic compounds, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic compounds shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be conducted at or soon after the start of a recommended engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lubricant change interval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, need not be done for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any fuels and additives in the methane or propane fuel families, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nor for fuels and additives in the atypical categories of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other fuel families, pursuant to the definitions of such families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and categories in &sect;79.56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Analysis for poly-chlorinated dibenzodioxins and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs), specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, is required only for fuels and additives which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain chlorine as an atypical element, pursuant to paragraph

Literature Search. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives shall conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a literature search and compilation of information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential toxicologic, environmental, and other public welfare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the emissions of such fuels and additives. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature search shall include all available relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from in-house, industry, government, and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources pertaining to the emissions of the subject fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive or the emissions of similar fuels or additives, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such similarity determined according to the provisions of &sect;79.56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The literature search shall address the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects of whole combustion emissions, evaporative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, relevant emission fractions, and individual emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products of the subject fuel or fuel additive except as specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the following paragraph. The individual emission products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included are those identified pursuant to the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, other than carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxides, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case of the individual emission products of non-baseline or atypical fuels and additives (pursuant to &sect;79.56(e)(2)),
the literature data need not be submitted for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission products which are the same as the combustion emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products of the respective base fuel for the product's fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family (pursuant to &sect;79.55). For this purpose, data on the base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel emission products for the product's fuel family: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) May be found in the literature of previously-conducted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate emission speciation studies for the base fuel, or for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or additive/fuel mixture capable of grouping with the base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel (see, for example, the references in paragraph (b)(5) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section).

Manufacturer Determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the information gathered pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature search in &sect;79.52(d) contains the results of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately performed and adequately documented previous testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides information reasonably comparable to that supplied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the health tests described in &sect;&sect;79.62 through 79.68 regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive/fertility measures, and general toxicity effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions of the fuel or additive. When manufacturers make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an affirmative determination, they need submit only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information gathered pursuant to &sect;79.52(d) for such tests. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains final authority in judging whether the information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequate substitution in lieu of conducting the associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. EPA's determination of the adequacy of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information shall be guided by the considerations described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) of this section. If EPA finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test data, then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer will not be considered to be in compliance until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponding tests have been conducted and the results submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to EPA.

Testing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) All testing required pursuant to this section must be done in accordance with the procedures, equipment, and facility

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements described in &sect;&sect;79.57, 79.60, and 79.61 regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions generation, good laboratory practices, and inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure testing, respectively, as well as any other requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in this subpart. The laboratory conducting the animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies shall be registered and in good standing with the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Department of Agriculture and regularly inspected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Department of Agriculture veterinarians. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the facility must be accredited by a generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized independent organization which sets laboratory animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care standards. Use of inadequate test protocols or substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory techniques in performing any testing required by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart may result in cancellation of all affected registrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA Determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) After submission of all information and testing, EPA in its judgment shall determine whether previously conducted
tests relied upon in the registration submission are adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed and documented and provide information reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable to that which would be provided by the tests described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herein. Manufacturers' submissions shall be sufficiently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques, experimental design, statistical analyses, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions. Studies shall be performed using generally accepted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific principles, good laboratory techniques, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing guidelines specified in these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA shall give appropriate weight when making this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination to the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The age of the data; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The adequacy of documentation of procedures, findings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conclusions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The extent to which the testing conforms to generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted scientific principles and practices; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The type and number of test subjects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The number and adequacy of exposure concentrations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, emission dilutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The degree to which the tested emissions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by procedures and under conditions reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable to those set forth in &sect;79.57; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vii) The degree to which the test procedures conform to the testing guidelines set forth in &sect;&sect;79.60 through
79.68 and/or furnish information comparable to that provided by such testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The test animals shall be rodents, preferably a strain of rat, and testing shall include all of the endpoints covered
in &sect;&sect;79.62 through 79.68. All studies shall be properly executed, with appropriate documentation, and
in accord with the individual health testing guidelines (&sect;&sect;79.60 through 79.68) of this part, e.g., 90-day,
6-hour per day exposure, minimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In general, the data in a manufacturer's registration submittal shall be adequate if the duration of a test's exposure
period is at least as long, in days and hours, as the inhalation exposure specified in the related health test guideline(s).
Data from tests with shorter exposure durations than those specified in the guidelines may be acceptable if the test
results are positive (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, exhibit adverse effects) and/or include a demonstrable concentration-response relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Data in support of a manufacturer's registration submittal shall directly address the effects of inhalation
exposure to the whole evaporative and exhaust emissions of the respective fuel or additive or to the whole evaporative
and exhaust emissions of other fuels or additives which satisfy the criteria in &sect;79.56 for classification into
the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive. Data obtained in the testing of a raw liquid fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture or a raw, aerosolized fuel or additive/base fuel mixture shall not be adequate to support a manufacturer's
registration submittal. Data from testing of evaporative emissions cannot substitute for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test data on combustion emissions. Data from testing of combustion emissions cannot substitute for test data on evaporative
emissions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Criteria for Requiring Tier 3 Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Tier 3 testing shall be required of a manufacturer or group of manufacturers at EPA's discretion when remaining
uncertainties as to the significance of observed health effects, welfare effects, and/or emissions exposures from
a fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel/additive mixture interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable estimates of the potential risks posed by
emissions from the fuel or additive products. Tier 3 testing may be conducted either on an individual basis or a group
basis. If performed on a group basis, EPA may require either the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative to be used in Tier 3 testing as was used in Tier 2 testing or may select a different member or members of
the group to represent the group in the Tier 3 tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the criteria specific to particular tests as summarized and detailed in the testing guidelines
(&sect;&sect;79.62 through 79.68), EPA may consider a number of factors (including, but not limited to): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The identification of concentration-effect relationships; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects would be likely to lead to incapacitating or irreversible
conditions); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The type and number of species included in the reported tests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The presence or absence of effective health test control data for base-fuel-only versus additive/base fuel
mixture comparisons; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The nature and amount of known toxic agents in the emissions stream; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) The observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important exposure route.

Consideration of exposure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA retains discretion to consider, in addition to available toxicity data, any Tier 1 data on potential exposures
to emissions from a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels and/or fuel additives) in determining whether
to require Tier 3 testing. EPA may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Types and emission rates of combinations of compounds or elements of concern; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Historical and/or projected production volumes and market distributions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Estimated population and/or environmental exposures obtained through extrapolation, modeling, or literature
search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) EPA will determine whether Tier 3 testing is necessary upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal
as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed under &sect;79.51(d). If EPA determines on the basis of the Tier 1 and 2 data submission and any other available
information that further testing is necessary, EPA will require the responsible manufacturer(s) to conduct testing
as described elsewhere in this section. EPA will notify the manufacturer (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group) by certified letter of the purpose and nature of any proposed testing and of the proposed deadline for completing
the testing. A copy of the letter will be placed in the public record. EPA will provide the manufacturer a 60-day comment
period after the manufacturer's receipt of such notice. EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extend the comment period if it appears from the nature of the issues raised that further discussion is warranted.
In the event that no comment is received by EPA from the manufacturer (or group) within the comment period, the manufacturer
(or group) shall be deemed to have consented to the adoption by EPA of the proposed Tier 3 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA will issue a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of its intent to require testing under Tier 3 for a particular fuel or additive manufacturer and that a copy of the letter
to the manufacturer outlining the Tier 3 testing for that manufacturer is available in the public record for review
and comment. The public shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of this notice to comment on the proposed Tier 3 testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed Tier 3 testing requirements
received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such comments. After
reviewing all such comments received, EPA will adopt final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3 requirements by sending a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group.
EPA will also issue a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing that it has adopted such final Tier 3 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements
has been included in the public record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Prior to beginning any required Tier 3 testing, the manufacturer shall submit detailed test protocols to EPA for
approval. Once EPA has determined the Tier 3 testing requirements and approves the test protocols, any modification
to the requirements shall be governed by &sect;79.51(f).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity testing may be indicated if the results of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Micronucleus Assay, required under &sect;79.64, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, required under &sect;79.65, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay required under
&sect;79.68, or relevant pathologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings under &sect;79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant dose-related positive response as compared
with appropriate controls. Alternatively, Tier 3 carcinogenicity testing and/or mutagenicity testing may be required
if there are positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests required under &sect;&sect;79.64, 79.65, and 79.68. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The testing for carcinogenicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance
with 40 CFR 798.3300 or 798.3320, or their equivalents (see suggested references following each health effects testing
guideline). The testing for mutagenicity required under this paragraph may likewise be conducted in accordance
with 40 CFR 798.5195, 798.5500, 798.5955, 798.7100, and/or other suitable equivalent testing (see suggested references
following each health effects testing guideline). EPA may supplement or modify guidelines as required to ensure
that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reproductive and Teratological Effects Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 testing may be indicated if the results of the Fertility Assessment/Teratology study
required under &sect;79.63 or relevant findings under &sect;79.62 demonstrate, in comparison with appropriate
controls, a statistically significant dose-related positive response in one or more of the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test outcomes. Similarly, Tier 3 testing may be indicated if statistically significant positive results are confined
to either sex, or to the fetus as opposed to the pregnant adult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The testing for reproductive and teratological effects required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion,

Neurotoxicity Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 neurotoxicity testing may be indicated if either the results of the Neuropathology
Assessment required under &sect;79.67 shows concentration-related effects in exposed animals or the Glial Fibrillary
Acidic Protein Assay required under &sect;79.66 demonstrates a statistically significant concentration-related
positive response as compared with appropriate controls. Similarly, Tier 3 neurotoxicity testing may be indicated
if relevant results under &sect;79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant positive response in comparison
to appropriate controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The testing for neurotoxicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance
with 40 CFR 798.3260 and 40 CFR part 798 subpart G. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as required
to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of concern.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General and Pulmonary Toxicity Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 general and/or pulmonary toxicity testing may be indicated if, in comparison with appropriate
controls, the results of the Subchronic Toxicity Study, pursuant to &sect;79.62, demonstrate abnormal gross analysis
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histopathological findings (especially as relates to lung pathology from whole-body preserved test animals) or
persistence or delayed occurrence of toxic effects beyond the exposure period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A potential need for Tier 3 testing with respect to other organ systems or endpoints not addressed by specific Tier
2 tests, e.g., hepatic, renal, or endocrine toxicity, may be demonstrated by findings in the Tier 2 Subchronic Toxicity
Study (pursuant to &sect;79.62) or by findings in the Tier 1 literature search of adverse functional, physiologic,
metabolic, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histopathologic effects of fuel or additive emissions to such other organ systems or any other information available
to EPA. In addition, findings in the Tier 1 emission characterization of significant levels of a known toxicant to
such other organ systems and endpoints may also indicate a need for relevant health effects testing. The testing required
under this paragraph may include tests conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.3260 or 798.3320. These guidelines
may be modified or supplemented by EPA as necessary to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified
areas of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The testing for general/pulmonary toxicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted
in accordance with 40 CFR 798.2450 or 798.3260. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as necessary
to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern. Pulmonary function measurements,
host defense assays, immunotoxicity tests, cell morphology/morphometry, and/or enzyme assays of lung lavage cells
and fluids may be specifically required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Tier 3 Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A manufacturer or group may be required to use up-to-date modeling, sampling, monitoring, and/or analytic approaches
at the Tier 3 level to provide: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Estimates of exposures to the emission products of a fuel or fuel additive or group of products; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The expected atmospheric transformation products of such emissions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The environmental partitioning of such emissions to the air, soil, water, and biota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Additional emission characterization may be required if uncertainty over the identity of chemical species or
rate of their emission interferes with reasonable judgments as to the presence and/or concentration of potentially
toxic substances in the emissions of a fuel or fuel additive. The required tests may include characterization of additional
classes of emissions, the characterization of emissions generated by additional vehicles/engines of various technology
mixes (e.g., catalyzed versus non-catalyzed emissions), and/or other more precise analytic procedures for identification
or quantification of emissions compounds. Additional emissions testing may also be required to evaluate concerns
which may arise regarding the potential effects of a fuel or fuel additive on the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of emission control equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) A manufacturer or group may be required to conduct biological and/or exposure studies at the Tier 3 level to evaluate
directly the potential public welfare or environmental effects of the emissions of a fuel or additive, if significant
concerns about such effects arise as a result of EPA's review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the literature search or emission characterization findings in Tier 1 or the results of the toxicological tests in
Tier 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) With regard to group submittals, Tier 3 studies on a fuel or additive product(s) other than the originally specified
group representative may be required if specific differences in the product's composition indicate that its emissions
may have different toxicologic properties from those of the original group representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Additional emission characterization and/or toxicologic tests may be required to evaluate the impact of different
vehicle, engine, or emission control technologies on the observed composition or health or welfare effects of the
emissions of a fuel or additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Toxicological tests on individual emission products may be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Upon review of information submitted for an aerosol product under &sect;79.58(e), emissions characterization,
exposure, and/or toxicologic testing at a Tier 3 level may be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) A manufacturer which qualifies for and has elected to use the special provisions for the products of small businesses
(pursuant to &sect;79.58(d)) may be required to conduct emission characterization, exposure, and /or toxicologic
studies at the Tier 3 level for such products, as specified in &sect;79.58(d)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The examples of potential Tier 3 tests described in this section do not in any way limit EPA's broad discretion and
authority under Tier 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The base fuel(s) in each fuel family shall serve as the group representative(s) for the baseline group(s) in each
fuel family pursuant to &sect;79.56. Also, as specified in &sect;79.51(h)(1), for fuel additives undergoing testing,
the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family shall serve as the substrate in which the additive shall be
mixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the generation of emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Base fuels shall contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production or
distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation
and emission generation periods. Such additives shall be used at the minimum effective concentration-in-use for
the base fuel in question.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Unless otherwise restricted, the presence of trace contaminants does not preclude the use of a fuel or fuel additive
as a component of a base fuel formulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When an additive is the test subject, any additive normally contained in the base fuel which serves the same function
as the subject additive shall be removed from the base fuel formulation. For example, if a corrosion inhibitor were
the subject of testing and if this additive were to be tested in a base fuel which normally contained a corrosion inhibitor,
this test additive would replace the corrosion inhibitor normally included as a component of the base fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Additive components of the methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane base fuels in addition to any such additives
included below shall be limited to those recommended by the manufacturers of the vehicles and/or engines used in testing
such fuels. For this purpose, EPA will review requests from manufacturers (or their agents) to modify the additive
specifications for the alternative fuels and, if necessary, EPA shall change these specifications based on consistency
of those changes with the associated vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for the operation of the vehicle. EPA
shall publish notice of any such changes to a base fuel and/or its base additive package specifications in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(a) Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives are allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the testing requirements in &sect;&sect;79.52, 79.53, and 79.54 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the associated reporting requirements in &sect;79.59 on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual or group basis, provided that such products meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria in this section for enrollment in the same fuel/additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. However, each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must individually comply with the notification requirements of &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.59(b). Further, if a manufacturer elects to comply by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individually subject to the information requirements of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The use of the grouping provision to comply with Tier 1 and

Tier 2 testing requirements is voluntary. No manufacturer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited from testing and submitting its own data for its own

product registration, despite its qualification for membership in

(2) The only groups permitted are those established in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each manufacturer who chooses to enroll a fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive in a group of similar fuels and fuel additives as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated in this section may satisfy the registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements through a group submission of jointly-sponsored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and analysis conducted on a product which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of all products in that group, provided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group representative is chosen according to the specifications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The health effects information submitted by a group shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered applicable to all fuels and fuel additives in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. A fuel or fuel additive manufacturer who has chosen to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in a group may subsequently choose to perform testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such fuel or fuel additive on an individual basis; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until such independent registration information has been received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reviewed by EPA, the information initially submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group on behalf of the manufacturer's fuel or fuel additive shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered applicable and valid for that fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive. It could therefore be used to support requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further testing under the provisions of Tier 3 or to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory decisions affecting that fuel or fuel additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Manufacturers are responsible for determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate groups for their products according to the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this section and for enrolling their products into those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups under industry-sponsored or other independent brokering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Manufacturers who enroll a fuel or fuel additive into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group shall share the applicable costs according to appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements established by the group. The organization and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of group functions and the development of cost-sharing arrangements are the responsibility of the
participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. If manufacturers are unable to agree on fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable cost sharing arrangements and if such dispute is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred by one or more manufacturers to EPA for resolution, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions in &sect;79.56(c) (1) and (2) shall apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In complying with the registration requirements for a given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or fuel additive, notwithstanding the enrollment of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or additive in a group, a manufacturer may make use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information for any product which conforms to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouping criteria as the given product. If, for this purpose, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer wishes to rely upon the information previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by another manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration of a similar product (or group of products), then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous submitter is entitled to reimbursement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer for an appropriate portion of the applicable costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred to obtain and report such information. Such entitlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall remain in effect for a period of fifteen years following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date on which the original information was submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)(4)(ii), the manufacturer who relies on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously-submitted registration data shall certify to EPA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original submitter has been notified and that appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement arrangements have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When private efforts have failed to resolve a dispute about a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair amount or method of cost-sharing or reimbursement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing costs incurred under this subpart, then any party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in that dispute may initiate a hearing by filing two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed copies of a request for a hearing with a regional office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the American Arbitration Association and mailing a copy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request to EPA. A copy must also be sent to each person from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom the filing party seeks reimbursement or who seeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement from that party. The information and fees to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the request for hearing are specified in 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
791.20(b) and (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Additional procedures and requirements governing the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process are those specified in 40 CFR 791.22 through 791.50, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
791.60, 791.85, and 791.105, excluding 40 CFR 791.39(a)(3) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
791.48(d).

(1) Rather than segregating fuels and fuel additives into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate groups, the grouping system applies the same grouping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and creates a single set of groups applicable both to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels and fuel additives.

(2) Fuels shall be classified pursuant to &sect;79.56(e) into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the components and characteristics of such fuels in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their uncombusted state. The classification of a fuel product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must take into account the components of all bulk fuel additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are listed in the registration application or basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration data submitted for the fuel product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Fuel additives shall be classified pursuant to &sect;79.56(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the components and characteristics of the respective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncombusted additive/base fuel mixture pursuant to &sect;79.51(h)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In determining the category and group to which a fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ignored unless otherwise noted. Impurities are those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances which are present through contamination or which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in the fuel or additive naturally after processing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed.

Fuel/Additive Categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fuel/additive categories (Table F94&hyph;7, rows 1&hyph;3) are subdivisions of fuel families which represent
the degree to which fuels and fuel additives in the family resemble the base fuel(s) designated for the family. Three
general category types are defined in this section. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to &sect;79.51(h)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Baseline categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted
in the base fuel for the respective fuel family and conform to specified limitations on the amounts of certain components
or characteristics applicable to that fuel family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Non-Baseline Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted
in the base fuel for the respective fuel family, but which exceed one or more of the limitations for certain specified
components or characteristics applicable to baseline formulations in that fuel family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Atypical Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain elements or classes of compounds other
than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family or which otherwise do not meet the criteria for
either baseline or non-baseline formulations in that fuel family. A fuel or fuel additive product having both non-baseline
and atypical characteristics pursuant to &sect;79.56(e)(3), shall be considered to be an atypical product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) This section defines the specific categories applicable to each fuel family. When applied to fuel additives,
the criteria in these descriptions refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to &sect;79.51(h)(1).

Fuel/Additive Groups.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fuel/additive groups are subdivisions of the fuel/additive categories. One or more group(s) are defined within
each category in each fuel family according to the presence of differing characteristics in the fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture. For each group, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation (either a base fuel or a member fuel or additive product) is chosen to represent all the member products
in the group in any tests required under this subpart. The section which follows describes the fuel/additive groups.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) For gasoline fuel and additive products which contain 1.5 percent oxygen by weight or more, a separate non-baseline
gasoline group shall be defined by each oxygenate compound or methanol/co-solvent blend listed as a component in
the registration application or basic registration data of any such fuel or additive.

ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), dimethyl
ether (DME), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), and any other compound(s) which increase the oxygen content of the
gasoline formulation. A separate non-baseline gasoline group is defined for each such oxygenating compound.

) Each unique methanol and co-solvent combination (whether one, two, or more additional oxygenate compounds) used
in a non-baseline fuel shall also define a separate group. An oxygenate compound used as a co-solvent for methanol
in a non-baseline gasoline formulation must be identified as such in its registration. If the oxygenate is not identified
as a methanol co-solvent, then the compound shall be regarded by EPA as defining a separate non-baseline gasoline
group. Examples of methanol/co-solvent combinations occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include
methanol/isopropyl alcohol, methanol/butanol, and methanol with alcohols up to C8/octanol (Octamix).

fuel blended with the relevant oxygenate compound (or methanol/co-solvent combination) in an amount equivalent
to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) A fuel or additive containing one or more atypical elements attached to a polymer compound must be sorted into a separate
group from atypical fuels or fuel additives containing the same atypical element(s) in non-polymer form. However,
the occurrence of a polymer compound which does not contain an atypical element does not affect the grouping of a fuel
or additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Specific rules for sorting each family's atypical fuels and additives into separate groups, and for choosing
each such group's representative for testing, are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in &sect;79.56(d), a fuel product which is classified as
atypical because its basic registration data or application lists a bulk additive containing an atypical characteristic,
may be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and additives containing the same atypical characteristic.

mixture with the highest concentration-in-use or recommended concentration-in-use of the atypical element or
characteristic shall be the designated representative of that group. In the event that two or more fuels or additive/base
fuel mixtures within the group contain the same and highest concentration of the single atypical element or characteristic,
then the group representative shall be selected by a random method from among such candidate products.

Emission generation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section specifies the equipment and procedures that must be used in generating the emissions which are to be subjected
to the characterization procedures and/or the biological tests specified in &sect;&sect;79.52(b) and 79.53 of
these regulations. When applicable, they may also be required in conjunction with testing under &sect;&sect;79.54
and 79.58(c). Additional requirements concerning emission generation, delivery, dilution, quality control,
and safety practices are outlined in &sect;79.61. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vehicle and engine selection criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) All vehicles and engines used to generate emissions for testing a fuel or additive/fuel mixture must be new (i.e.,
never before titled) and placed into the program with less than 500 miles on the odometer or 12 hours on the engine chronometer.
The vehicles and engines shall be unaltered from the specifications of the original equipment manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The vehicle/engine type, vehicle/engine class, and vehicle/engine subclass designated to generate emissions
for a given fuel or additive shall be the same type, class, and subclass which, over the previous three years, has consumed
the most gallons of fuel in the fuel family applicable to the given fuel or additive. No distinction shall be made between
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks for purposes of this classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within this vehicle/engine type, class, and subclass, the specific vehicles and engines acceptable for emission
generation are those that represent the most common fuel metering system and the most common of the most important
emission control system devices or characteristics with respect to emission reduction performance for the model
year in which testing begins. These vehicles will be determined through a survey of the previous model year's vehicle/engine
sales within the given subclass. These characteristics shall include, but need not be limited to, aftertreatment
device(s), fuel aspiration, air injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and feedback type.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Within the applicable subclass, the five highest selling vehicle/engine models that contain the most common
such equipment and characteristics shall be determined. Any of these five models of the current model year (at the
time testing begins) may be selected for emission generation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If one or more of the five models is not available for the current model year, the choice of model for emission generation
shall be limited to those remaining among the five. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If fewer than five models of the given vehicle/engine type are available for the current model year, all such models
shall be eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When the fuel or fuel additive undergoing testing is not commonly used or intended to be used in the vehicle/engine
types prescribed by this selection procedure, or when rebuilding or alteration is required to obtain a suitable vehicle/engine
for emission generation, the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for a modification in test procedure requirements.
Any such request must include objective test results which support the claim that a more appropriate vehicle/engine
type is needed as well as a suggested substitute vehicle/engine type. The vehicle/engine selection in this case shall
be approved by EPA prior to the start of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Once a particular model has been chosen on which to test a fuel or additive product, all mileage accumulation and
generation of emissions for characterization and biological testing of such product shall be conducted on that same
model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the initial test vehicle/engine fails or must be replaced for any reason, emission generation shall continue
with a second vehicle/engine which is identical to, or resembles to the greatest extent possible, the initial test
vehicle/engine. If more than one replacement vehicle/engine is necessary, all such vehicles/engines shall be identical,
or resemble to the greatest extent possible, the initial test vehicle/engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Manufacturers are encouraged to obtain, at the start of a test program, more than one emission generation vehicle/engine
of the identical model, to ensure the availability of back-up emission generator(s). All backup vehicles/engines
must be conditioned and must have their emissions fully characterized, as done for the initial test vehicle/engine,
prior to their use as emission generators for biological testing. Alternating between such vehicles/engines regularly
during the course of testing is permissible and advisable, particularly to allow regular maintenance on such vehicles/engines
during prolonged health effects testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vehicle/engine operation and maintenance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) For the purpose of generating combustion emissions from a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture for which the relevant
class is light duty, either a light-duty vehicle shall be operated on a chassis dynamometer or a light-duty engine
shall be operated on an engine dynamometer. When the relevant class is heavy duty, the emissions shall be generated
on a heavy-duty engine operated on an engine dynamometer. In both cases, the vehicle or engine model shall be selected
as described in paragraph (a) of this section and shall have all applicable fuel and emission control systems intact.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in &sect;79.51(h)(2)(iii), the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture being tested shall be used
at all times during operation of the test vehicle or engine. No other fuels or additives shall be used in the test vehicle
or engine once mileage accumulation has begun until emission generation for emission characterization and biological
testing purposes is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Scheduled and unscheduled vehicle/engine maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) During emission generation, vehicles and engines must be maintained in good condition by following the recommendations
of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for scheduled service and parts replacement, with repairs performed
only as necessary. Modifications, adjustments, and maintenance procedures contrary to procedures found in 40 CFR
part 86 for the maintenance of test vehicles/engines or performed solely for the purpose of emissions improvement
are not allowed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) If unscheduled maintenance becomes necessary, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine must be repaired to OEM specifications, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OEM or OEM-approved parts. In addition, the tester is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to measure the basic emissions pursuant to &sect;79.52(b)(2)(i) after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unscheduled maintenance and before resuming testing to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the post-maintenance emissions shall be within 20 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-maintenance emissions levels. If the basic emissions cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be brought within 20 percent of their previous levels, then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer shall restart the emissions characterization and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health testing of its products combustion emissions using a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle/engine.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mileage accumulation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A vehicle/engine break-in period is required prior to generating emissions for characterization and/or biological

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing under this subpart. The required mileage accumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be accomplished on a test track, on the street, on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamometer, or using any other conventionally accepted method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Vehicles to be used in the evaluation of baseline and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-baseline fuels and fuel additives shall accumulate 4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles prior to emission testing. Engines to be used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of baseline and non-baseline fuels and fuel additives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall accumulate 125 hours of operation on an engine dynamometer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to emission testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the test formulation is classified as an atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or fuel additive formulation (pursuant to definitions in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.56(e)(4)(iii)), the following additional mileage accumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The test vehicle/engine must be operated for a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4,000 vehicle miles or 125 hours of engine operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Thereafter, at intervals determined by the tester, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission fractions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be sampled and analyzed for the presence and amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical element(s) and/or other atypical constituents. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to paragraph (d) of this section, the sampled emissions must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated in the absence of an intact aftertreatment device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Immediately before the samples are taken, a brief warmup period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(at least ten miles or the engine equivalent) is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Mileage accumulation shall continue until either 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or more of the mass of each atypical element (or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atypical constituent) entering the engine can be measured in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust emissions (all fractions combined), or the vehicle/engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has accumulated mileage (or hours) equivalent to 40 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the average useful life of the applicable vehicle/engine class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(pursuant to regulations in 40 CFR part 86). For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum mileage required for light-duty vehicles is 40 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100,000 miles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40,000 miles), while the maximum time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation for heavy-duty engines is the equivalent of 40 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 290,000 miles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the equivalent in engine hours of 116,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When either condition in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section has been reached, additional emission characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and biological testing of the emissions may begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of exhaust aftertreatment devices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the selected test vehicle/engine, as certified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, does not come equipped with an emissions aftertreatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device (such as a catalyst or particulate trap), such device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not be used in the context of this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for certain specialized additives, the following provisions apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the test vehicle/engine, as certified by EPA, comes equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an emissions aftertreatment device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For mileage accumulation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When the test formulation does not contain any atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements (pursuant to definitions in &sect;79.56(e)(4)(iii)), an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact aftertreatment device must be used during mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When the test formulation does contain atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements, then the manufacturer may choose to accumulate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic wash coat). In either case, sampling and analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions for measurement of the mass of the atypical element(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as described in &sect;79.57(c)(3)) must be done on emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated with a non-functional (blank) aftertreatment device.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) If the manufacturer chooses to accumulate mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without a functional aftertreatment device, and if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer wishes to do this outside of a laboratory/test track 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting, then a memorandum of exemption for product testing must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be obtained by applying to the Director of the Field Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Support Division (see &sect;79.59(a)(1)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For Tier 2 (&sect;79.53), the standard requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological testing of combustion emissions shall be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using emissions generated with a non-functioning aftertreatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

Tier 3 requirements (&sect;79.54) which may be prescribed by EPA, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of functional or nonfunctional aftertreatment devices shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be specified by EPA as part of the test guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In the case where an intact aftertreatment device is

to the greatest extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this

(1) Generating combustion emissions for emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Combustion emissions shall be generated according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exhaust emission portion of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the certification of new motor vehicles, found in 40 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86, subpart B for light-duty vehicles/engines, and subparts D, M 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and N for heavy-duty vehicles/engines. The Urban Dynamometer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Driving Schedule (UDDS), pursuant to 40 CFR part 86, appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I(a), shall apply to light-duty vehicles/engines and the Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dynamometer Driving Schedule (EDS), pursuant to 40 CFR part 86, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix I(f)(2), shall apply to heavy-duty vehicles/engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The motoring portion of the heavy-duty test cycle may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated, at the manufacturer's option, for the generation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For light-duty engines operated on an engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamometer, the tester shall determine the speed-torque 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalencies (``trace'') for its test engine from valid FTP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing performed on a chassis dynamometer, using a test vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an engine identical to that being tested. The test engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must then be operated under these speed and torque specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to simulate the FTP cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Special procedures not included in the FTP may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary in order to characterize emissions from fuels and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives containing atypical elements or to collect some types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of emissions (e.g., particulate emissions from light-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles/engines, semi-volatile emissions from both light-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and heavy-duty vehicles/engines). Such alterations to the FTP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are acceptable.

(ii) Pursuant to &sect;79.52(b)(1)(i) and &sect;79.57(d)(2)(ii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission generation and characterization must be repeated three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times when the selected vehicle/engine is normally operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an emissions aftertreatment device and six times when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected vehicle/engine is normally operated with an emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aftertreatment device. In the latter case, the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation and characterization process shall be repeated three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times with the intact aftertreatment device in place and three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times with a non-functioning (blank) aftertreatment device in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) From both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles/engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples of vapor phase, semi-volatile phase, and particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase emissions shall be collected, except that semi-volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase, and particulate emissions need not be sampled for fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and additives in the methane and propane families (pursuant to &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.56(e)(1)(v) and (vi)). The number and type of samples to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected and separately analyzed during one emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation/characterization process are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) In the case of combustion emissions generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light-duty vehicles/engines, the samples consist of three bags of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor emissions (one from each segment of the light-duty exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission cycle) plus one sample of particulate-phase emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and one sample of semi-volatile-phase emissions (collected over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all segments of the exhaust emission cycle). If the mass of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate emissions or semi-volatile emissions obtained during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one driving cycle is not sufficient for characterization, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the driving cycle may be performed again and the extracted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fractions combined prior to chemical analysis. Particulate-phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions shall not be combined with semi-volatile-phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In the case of combustion emissions generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy-duty engines, the samples consist of one sample of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission phase (vapor, particulate, and semi-volatile) collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the entire cold-start cycle and a second sample of each such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase collected over the entire hot-start cycle (see 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86.334 through 86.342). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission collection and storage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Vapor phase emissions shall be collected and stored in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tedlar bags for subsequent chemical analysis. Storage conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are specified in &sect;79.52(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Particulate phase emissions shall be collected on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate filter (or more than one, if required) using methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in 40 CFR 86.1301 through 86.1344. These methods, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordinarily applied only to heavy-duty emissions, are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adapted and used for collection of particulates from light-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles/engines, as well. The particulate matter may be stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the filter in a sealed container, or the soluble organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraction may be extracted and stored in a separate sealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container. Both the particulate and the extract shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shielded from ultraviolet light and stored at ^20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Particulate emissions shall be tested no later than six months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the date they were generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Semi-volatile emissions shall be collected immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream from the particulate collection filters using porous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polymer resin beds, or their equivalent, designed for their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture. The soluble organic fraction of semi-volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions shall be extracted immediately and tested within six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months of being generated. The extract shall be stored in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealed container which is shielded from ultraviolet light and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored at ^20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Particulate and semi-volatile phase emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection, handling and extraction methods shall not alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition of the collected material, to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Additional requirements for combustion emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling, storage, and characterization are specified in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Generating whole combustion emissions for biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Biological tests requiring whole combustion emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be conducted using emissions generated from the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine operated in general accordance with the FTP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures cited in this section. The emissions shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated continuously throughout the animal exposure periods, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diluted by an amount appropriate for the test being performed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in &sect;79.61(d)(3), passed through a mixing chamber, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routed to the biological test chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Light-duty test vehicles/engines shall be operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (or equivalent engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamometer trace, per paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and heavy-duty test engines shall be operated over the Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dynamometer Schedule (see 40 CFR part 86, appendix I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tolerances of the driving cycle shall be two times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those of the Federal Test Procedure and must be met 95 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The driving cycle shall be repeated as many times as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for the biological test session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Light-duty dynamometers shall be calibrated prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the start of a biological test (40 CFR 86.118&hyph;78), verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekly (40 CFR 86.118&hyph;78), and recalibrated as required. Heavy-duty dynamometers shall be calibrated and
checked prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start of a biological test (40 CFR 86.1318&hyph;84), recalibrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every two weeks (40 CFR 86.1318&hyph;84(a)) and checked as stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 86.1318&hyph;84(b) and (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The fuel reservoir for the test vehicle/engine shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large enough to operate the test vehicle/engine throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily biological exposure period, avoiding the need for refueling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An apparatus to integrate the large concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swings typical of transient-cycle exhaust is to be used between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FTP-Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) source of emissions and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure chamber containing the animal test cage(s). The purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such apparatus is to decrease the variability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological exposure atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A large mixing chamber is suggested for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mixing chamber would be charged from the CVS at a constant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate determined by the exposure chamber purge rate. Flow to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure chamber would begin at the conclusion of the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient cycle with the associated mixing chamber charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A potential alternative apparatus is a mini-diluter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see, for example, AIGER/CRADA, February, 1994 in &sect;79.57(g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The mixing chamber (or any alternative emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderation apparatus) must function such that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of total hydrocarbons leaving the apparatus shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be within 10 percent of the average concentration of hydrocarbons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering the chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission dilution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Dilution air can be pre-dried to lower the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humidity, thus permitting a lower dilution rate and a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of hydrocarbons to be achieved without condensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of water vapor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) With gasoline fuels, a minimum dilution ratio of about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1:5 raw exhaust (dewpoint about 125 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) with dry, clean filtered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air is required to reduce the water concentration to a dewpoint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of about 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The minimum dilution ratio (maximum exhaust flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate) occurs at about 200 seconds into the UDDS transient driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle. Larger minimum dilution ratios are required if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution air includes water vapor. However, the minimum dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio will vary with fuel composition. Fuels which generate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater engine exhaust water concentrations (e.g., alcohol and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural gas fuels) will require greater initial dilutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heated transfer ducts or tubing can be used to avoid water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensation in much of the system, but the mixing chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section will generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be at or near laboratory temperature, and CVS dilution will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be adequate to assure that the cumulative dew point in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber remains below laboratory temperature at all times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(further guidance on this topic may be found in Black and Snow, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 in &sect;79.57(g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) After the initial exhaust dilution to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
character of the exhaust, the exhaust stream can be further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diluted in the mixing chamber (and/or after leaving the chamber) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to achieve the desired biological exposure concentrations.

i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, from exhaust pipe to outlet in the biological testing chamber) shall be verified before any animal exposures begin,
and verified at least weekly during testing. (See procedures at 40 CFR 86.119&hyph;90 for light-duty vehicles and
&sect;86.1319&hyph;90 for heavy-duty engines.) Verification testing shall be accomplished by introducing a known
sample at the end of the vehicle/engine exhaust pipe into the dilution system and measuring the amount exiting the
system. For example, an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas chromatograph (GC) and flame ionization
detector (FID) to determine the recovery factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Verification of the integrity of the mixing chamber (or alternative apparatus) shall be determined before animal
exposures begin and at least weekly thereafter. Composite values for weight percent total hydrocarbons shall be
determined for the test vehicle/engine's dilute exhaust stream entering and exiting the mixing chamber apparatus.
These values must be within 10 percent of each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to control variability of emissions during the generation of exposure emissions during health effect testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

also be performed to establish the stability and consistency of particle size distribution in the test exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The testing facility shall allow an audit of its premises, the qualifications, e.g., curriculum vitae, of its
staff assigned to testing, and the specimens and records of the testing for registration purposes (as specified in
&sect;79.60).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) In order to allow for unforeseen problems with the emission generation or dilution equipment, emission generation
may be interrupted for up to four hours on a maximum of two occasions in any four-week period of testing. The amount of
time for which emission generation was interrupted shall subsequently be added after the equipment problem is corrected.
If the equipment problem causes more than four consecutive hours of emission generation to be interrupted, or if more
than two such occasions occurs in any four-week period during testing, the interrupted tests shall be void. Testers
shall be aware of concerns for backup vehicles/engines cited in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.

Emissions shall be collected and sampled using equipment and methods appropriate for use with the compounds being
characterized and the requirements of the emission characterization analysis. In the case of potentially explosive
test substance concentrations, care must be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres. The tester is referred
to &sect;79.61(d)(8) for considerations involving explosivity.

Evaporative Emissions Generator (EEG) Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied causing a portion of the fuel to evaporate at a desired rate. The
manufacturer has flexibility in designing an EEG for testing a particular fuel or fuel additive. The sample used to
generate emissions in the EEG shall be renewed at least daily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The evaporation chamber shall be made from materials compatible with the fuels and additives being tested and
shall be equipped with a drain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The chamber shall be filled to 40 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 percent of its interior volume with the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture being tested, with the remainder of the
volume containing air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The concentration of the evaporated fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the vapor space of the evaporation
chamber during the time emissions are being withdrawn for testing shall not vary by more than 10 percent from the equilibrium
concentration in the vapor space of emissions generated from the fresh fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the chamber.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) During the course of a day's emission generation period, the level of fuel in the EEG shall be maintained to within
7 percent of its height at the start of the daily exposure period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The fuel used in the EEG shall be drained at the end of each daily exposure. The EEG shall be refilled with a fresh supply
of the test formulation before the start of each daily exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The vapor space of the evaporation chamber shall be well mixed throughout the time emissions are being withdrawn
for testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The size of the evaporation chamber shall be determined by the rate at which evaporative emissions shall be needed
in the test animal exposure chambers and the rate at which the fuel or the additive/base fuel mixture evaporates. The
rate of evaporative emissions may be adjusted by altering the size of the EEG or by using one or more additional EEG(s).
Emission rate modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control or pressure control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The temperature of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the evaporation chamber shall be 130 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The vapors shall maintain this temperature up to the point in the system where the vapors are diluted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The pressure in the vapor space of the evaporation chamber and the dilution and sampling apparatus shall stay
within 10 percent of ambient atmospheric pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) There shall be no controls or equipment on the evaporation chamber system that change the concentration or composition
of the vapors generated for testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Manufacturers shall perform verification testing of evaporative emissions in a manner analogous to the verification
testing performed for combustion emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For biological testing, vapor shall be withdrawn from the EEG at a constant rate, diluted with air as required for
the particular study, and conducted immediately to the biological testing chamber(s) in a manner similar to the method
used in &sect;79.57(e), excluding the mixing chamber therein. The rate of emission generation shall be high enough
to supply the biological exposure chamber with sufficient emissions to allow for a minimum of fifteen air changes
per exposure chamber per hour. Interruption of evaporative emissions exposures during biological testing for more
than four consecutive hours, or on more than two separate occasions within a four-week period for less than four consecutive
hours, shall cause the affected test(s) to be void.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) For characterization of evaporative emissions, samples of equilibrated emissions to the vapor space of the EEG
shall be withdrawn into Tedlar bags, then stored and analyzed as specified in &sect;79.52(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) may submit to EPA a request for approval of an alternative method of
generating evaporative emissions for use in emission characterization and biological tests required under this
subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To be approved by EPA, the request must fully explain the rationale for the proposed method as well as the technical
procedures, quality control, and safety precautions to be used, and must demonstrate that the proposed method will
meet the following criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The emission mixture generated by the proposed procedures must be reasonably similar to the equilibrium composition
of the vapor which occurs in the vehicle fuel tank head space when the subject fuel or additive/base fuel mixture is
in use and near-maximum in-use temperatures are encountered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The emissions mixture generated by the proposed method must be sufficiently concentrated to provide adequate
exposure levels in the context of the required toxicologic tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The proposed method must include procedures to ensure that the emissions delivered to the biologic exposure chambers
will provide a reasonably constant exposure atmosphere over time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If EPA approves the request, EPA will place in the public record a copy of the request, together with all supporting
procedural descriptions and justifications, and will notify the public of its availability by publishing a notice
in the

Fuels which are not designated as ``evaporative fuels'' and fuel additives which are not designated as ``evaporative
fuel additives'' pursuant to the definitions in &sect;79.50 need not undergo the emission characterization or health
effects testing specified in &sect;&sect;79.52 and 79.53 for evaporative emissions. At EPA's discretion, the evaporative
emissions of such fuels and additives may be required to undergo Tier 3 testing, pursuant to &sect;79.54.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative Tier 2 Provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At EPA's discretion, EPA may modify the standard Tier 2 health effects testing requirements for a fuel or fuel additive
(or group). Such modification may encompass substitution, addition, or deletion of Tier 2 studies or study specifications,
and/or changes in underlying engine or equipment requirements, except that a Tier 2 endpoint will not be deleted in
the absence of existing information deemed adequate by EPA or alternative testing requirements for such endpoint.
If warranted by the particular requirements, EPA will allow additional time for completion of the alternative Tier
2 testing program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When EPA intends to require testing in lieu of or in addition to standard Tier 2 health testing, EPA will notify the
responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified letter of the specific tests which EPA is proposing to require in
lieu of or in addition to Tier 2, and the proposed schedule for completion and submission of such tests. A copy of the
letter will be placed in the public record. EPA intends to send the notification prior to November 27, 1995, or in the
case of new fuels and additives (as defined in &sect;79.51(c)(3)), within 18 months of EPA's receipt of an intent to
register such product. However, EPA's notification to the manufacturer (or group) may occur at any time up to EPA's
receipt of Tier 2 data for the product(s) in question. EPA will provide the manufacturer with 60 days from the date of
receipt of the notice to comment on the tests which EPA is proposing to require and on the proposed schedule. If the manufacturer
believes that undue costs or hardships will occur as a result of EPA's delay in providing notification of alternative
Tier 2 requirements, then the manufacturer's comments should describe and include evidence of such hardship. In
particular, if the standard Tier 2 toxicology testing for the fuel or additive in question has already begun at the
time the manufacturer receives EPA's notification of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements, then EPA shall refrain
from requiring alternative Tier 2 tests provided that EPA receives the standard Tier 2 data and report (pursuant to
&sect;79.59(c)) within one year of the date on which the toxicology testing began.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA will issue a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing its intent to require special testing in lieu of or in addition to the standard Tier 2 testing for a particular
fuel or additive manufacturer or group, and that a copy of the letter to the manufacturer or group describing the proposed
alternative Tier 2 testing for that manufacturer or group is available in the public record for review and comment.
The public shall have a minimum of 30 days after the publication of this notice to comment on the proposed alternative
Tier 2 testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed alternative Tier 2 testing
requirements received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such
comments. After reviewing all such comments received, EPA may adopt final alternative Tier 2 requirements by sending
a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group. In that event, EPA will also issue
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing that it has adopted final alternative Tier 2 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements
has been included in the public record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) After EPA's receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittals, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer
(or group) regarding the adequacy of the submittal and potential Tier 3 testing requirements according to the same
relative time intervals and by the same procedures as specified in &sect;79.51 (c) and (d) for routine Tier 1 and Tier
2 submittals.

Provisions Applicable to Atypical Products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer with total annual sales less than $10 million is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet the requirements of Tier 2 (specified in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.53) in regard to such manufacturer's fuel and/or additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products which meet the criteria for inclusion in an Atypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group pursuant to &sect;79.56. Upon such manufacturer's satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and submittal to EPA of basic registration data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in &sect;79.59(b) and Tier 1 information specified in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.52 for an Atypical fuel or additive, the manufacturer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request and EPA shall issue a registration for such product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to &sect;79.51(c) and paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. Compliance with Tier 1 requirements under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph may be accomplished by the individual manufacturer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a part of a group pursuant to &sect;79.56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any registration granted by EPA under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section are conditional upon satisfactory completion of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3 requirements which EPA may subsequently impose pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.54. In such circumstances, the Tier 3 requirements might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include (but would not necessarily be limited to) information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would otherwise have been required under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 1 and/or Tier 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The provisions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section are voluntary on the part of qualifying small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. Such manufacturers may choose to fulfill the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard requirements for their fuels and additives, individually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or as a part of a group, rather than satisfying only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and/or (d)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. If a qualifying small manufacturer elects these special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions rather than the standard requirements for a product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then EPA will generally assume that any additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by other manufacturers, for fuels and additives meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same grouping criteria (under &sect;79.56) as that of the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's product, is pertinent to further testing and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory decisions that may affect the small manufacturer's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) To obtain registration for an aftermarket aerosol fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive, the manufacturer shall provide existing information in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the form of a literature search, a discussion of the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure(s) to such product, and the basic registration data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in &sect;79.59(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The literature search shall include existing data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential health and welfare effects due to exposure to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aerosol product itself and its raw (uncombusted) components. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis for potential exposures shall be based on the actual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated production volume and market distribution of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular aerosol product, and its estimated frequency of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements are not routinely required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for aerosol products. EPA will review the submitted information

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This section prescribes good laboratory practices (GLPs) for conducting inhalation exposure studies relating
to motor vehicle emissions health effects testing under this part. These directions are intended to ensure the quality
and integrity of health effects data submitted pursuant to registration regulations issued under sections 211(b)
or 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7545). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) This section applies to any study described by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section which any person conducts,
initiates, or supports on or after May 27, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) It is EPA's policy that all health effects data developed under sections 211(b) and (e) of CAA be in accordance
with provisions of this section. If data are not developed in accordance with the provisions of this section, EPA may
consider such data insufficient to evaluate the health effects of a motor vehicle's fuel or fuel additive emissions,
unless the submitter provides additional information demonstrating that the data are reliable and adequate and
EPA determines that the data are sufficient.

Animal and other test system care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) There shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard operating procedures for the housing, feeding, handling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and care of animals and other test systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) All newly received test systems from outside sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be isolated and their health status or appropriateness for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the study shall be evaluated. This evaluation shall be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with acceptable veterinary medical practice or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) At the initiation of a study, test systems shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free of any disease or condition that might interfere with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose or conduct of the study. If during the course of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study, the test systems contract such a disease or condition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseased test systems shall be isolated, if necessary. These test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems may be treated for disease or signs of disease provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such treatment does not interfere with the study. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnosis, authorization of treatment, description of treatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and each date of treatment shall be documented and shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) When laboratory procedures require test animals to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manipulated and observed over an extended period of time or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies require test animals to be removed from and returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their housing units for any reason (e.g., cage cleaning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, etc.), these test systems shall receive appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification (e.g., tattoo, color code, etc.). Test system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification shall conform with current laboratory animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling practice. All information needed to specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify each test system within the test system-housing unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall appear on the outside of that unit. Suckling animals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, test animals of different species shall be housed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate rooms when necessary. Test animals of the same species, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but used in different studies, shall not ordinarily be housed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same room when inadvertent exposure to the test or reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances or test system mixup could affect the outcome of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either study. If such mixed housing is necessary, adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiation by space and identification shall be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) Test systems that may be used in multispecies tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need not be housed in separate rooms, provided that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately segregated to avoid mixup and cross-contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) [reserved] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vi) Cages, racks, pens, enclosures, and other holding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rearing, and breeding areas, and accessory equipment, shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned and sanitized at appropriate intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vii) Feed and water used for the test animals shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed periodically to ensure that contaminants known to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of interfering with the study and reasonably expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be present in such feed or water are not present at greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trace levels. Documentation of such analyses shall be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as raw data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (viii) Bedding used in animal cages or pens shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with the purpose or conduct of the study and shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed as often as necessary to keep the animals dry and clean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ix) If any pest control materials are used, the use shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be documented. Cleaning and pest control materials that interfere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the study shall not be used.

Principles and design criteria of inhalation exposure systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proper conduct of inhalation toxicity studies of the emissions of fuels and additive/fuel mixtures requires that
the exposure system be designed to ensure the controlled generation of the exposure atmosphere, the adequate dilution
of the test emissions, delivery of the diluted exposure atmosphere to the test animals, and use of appropriate exposure
chamber systems selected to meet criteria for a given exposure study.

(i) The delivery system is the means used to transport the emissions from the generation system to the exposure system.
The dilution system is generally a component of the delivery system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Dilution provides control of the emissions concentration delivered to the exposure system, serving the function
of diluting the associated combustion gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide
and other noxious gases and vapors, to levels that will ensure that there are no significant or measurable responses
in the test animals as a result of exposure to the combustion gases. The formation of particle species is strongly dependent
on the dilution rate, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The engine exhaust system shall connect to the first-stage-dilution section at 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the axis of the dilution section. This is then connected to a right angle elbow on the center line of the dilution
section. Engine emissions are injected through the elbow so that exhaust flow is concurrent to dilution flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In designing the dilution and delivery systems, the use of plastic, e.g., PVC and similar materials, copper, brass,
and aluminum pipe and tubing shall be avoided if there exists a possibility of chemical reaction occurring between
emissions and tubing. Stainless steel pipe and tubing is recommended as the best choice for most emission dilution
and delivery applications, although glass and teflon may be appropriate, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flow requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Conduit for dilute raw emissions shall be of such dimensions as to provide residence times for the emissions on
the order of less than one second to several seconds before the emissions are further diluted and introduced to the
test chambers. With the high flow rates in the dilute raw emissions conduit, it will be necessary to sample various
portions of the dilute emissions for delivering differing concentrations to the test chambers. The unused portions
of the emissions stream are normally exhausted to the atmosphere outside of the exposure facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Dimensions of the dilute raw exhaust conduit shall be such that, at a minimum, the flow Reynolds number is 70,000
or greater (see Mokler, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1984 in paragraph (f)(13) of this section). This will maintain highly turbulent flow conditions so that there is
more complete mixing of the exhaust emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wall losses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The delivery system shall be designed to minimize wall losses. This can be done by sizing the tubing or pipe to maintain
laminar flow of the diluted emissions to the exposure chamber. A flow Reynolds number of 1000&hyph;3000 will ensure
minimal wall losses. Also, the length of and number and degree of bends in the delivery lines to the exposure chamber
system shall be minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Whole-body exposure vs. nose-only exposure delivery systems. Flow rates through whole-body chamber systems
are of the order of 100 liters per minute to 500 liters per minute. Nose-only systems are on the order of less than 50 liters
per minute. To maintain laminar flow conditions, the principles described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section
apply to both systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dilution requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) To maintain the water vapor, and dissolved organic compounds, in the raw exhaust emissions stream, a manufacturer/tester
will initially dilute one part emissions with a minimum of five parts clean, filtered air (see Hinners, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1979 in paragraph (f)(11) of this section). Depending on the water vapor content of a particular fuel/additive mixture's
combustion emissions and the humidity of the dilution air, initial exhaust dilutions as high as 1:15 or 1:20 may be
necessary to maintain the general character of the exhaust as it cools, e.g., M100. At this point, it is expected that
the exhaust stream would be further diluted to more appropriate levels for rodent health effects testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A maximum concentration (minimum dilution) of the raw exhaust going into the test animal cages is anticipated
to lie in the range between 1:5 and 1:50 exhaust emissions to clean, filtered air. The minimum concentration (maximum
dilution) of raw exhaust for health effects testing is anticipated to be in range between 1:100 and 1:150. Individual
manufacturers will treat these ranges as approximations only and will determine the optimum range of emission concentrations
to elicit effects in Tier 2 health testing for their particular fuel/fuel additive mixture.

Exposure chambers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are two basic types of dynamic inhalation exposure chambers, whole-body chambers and nose-/head-only exposure
chambers (see Cheng and Moss, 1989 in paragraph (f)(8) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Whole-body chambers.

 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The flow rate through a chamber shall be maintained at 15 air changes per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The chambers are usually maintained at a slightly negative pressure (0.5 to 1.5 inch of water) to prevent leakage
of test substance into the exposure room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The exposure chamber shall be designed in such a way as to provide uniform distribution of exposure concentrations
in all compartments (see Cheng 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989 in paragraph (f)(7) of this section).

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Animals are housed in separate compartments inside the chamber, where the whole surface area of an animal is exposed
to the test material. The spaces required for different animal species shall follow the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In general, the volume of animal bodies occupy less than 5 percent of the chamber volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Head/nose-only exposure chambers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) In head/nose-only exposure chambers, only the head (oronasal) portion of the animal is exposed to the test material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The chamber volume and flow rates are much less than in the whole-body exposure chambers because the subjects are
usually restrained in a tube holder where the animal's breathing can be easily monitored. The head/nose-only exposure
chamber is suitable for short-term exposures or when use of a small amount of test material is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Since whole-body exposure appears to be the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method. In
general, head/nose only exposure, which is sometimes used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, grooming, is not recommended because of the stress accompanying the restraining of the animals. However, there
may be specific instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body exposure. The tester shall provide justification
for its selection.

Animal selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The rat is the preferred species for vehicle emission inhalation health effects testing. Commonly used laboratory
strains shall be used. Any rodent species may be used, but the tester shall provide justification for the choice of
that species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Young adult animals, approximately ten weeks of age for the rat, shall be used. At the commencement of the study,
the weight variation of animals used shall not exceed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20 percent of the mean weight for each sex. Animals shall be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups according
to their weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An equal number of male and female rodents shall be used at each concentration level. Situations may arise where
use of a single sex may be appropriate. Females, in general, shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The number of animals used at each concentration level and in the control group(s) depends on the type of study,
number of biological end points used in the toxicity evaluation, the pre-determined sensitivity of detection and
power of significance of the study, and the animal species. For an acute study, at least five animals of each sex shall
be used in each test group. For both the subacute and subchronic studies, at least 10 rodents of each sex shall be used
in each test group. For a chronic study, at least 20 male and 20 female rodents shall be used in each test group.

Animal handling and care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) A key element in the conduct of inhalation exposure studies is the proper handling and care of the test animal population.
Therefore, the exposure conditions must conform strictly with the conditions for housing and animal care and use
set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In whole-body exposure chambers, animals shall be housed in individual caging. The minimum cage size per animal
will be in accordance with instructions set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Chambers shall be cleaned and maintained in accordance with recommendations and schedules set forth in the
Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Observations shall be made daily with appropriate actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g.,
necropsy or refrigeration of animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice of weak or moribund animals). Exposure
systems using head/nose-only exposure chambers require no special daily chamber maintenance. Chambers shall be
inspected to ensure that they are clean, and that there are no obstructions in the chamber which would restrict air
flow to the animals. Whole-body exposure chambers will be inspected on a minimum of twice daily, once before exposures
and once after exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, including the time of onset, degree, and duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Cage-side observations shall include, but are not limited to: changes in skin, fur, eye and mucous membranes,
respiratory, autonomic, and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity, and behavioral patterns. Particular
attention shall be directed to observation of tremors, convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, lethargy, sleep, and
coma.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concentration levels and selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) In acute and subacute toxicity tests, at least three exposure concentrations and a control group shall be used
and spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects and mortality rates. The data shall be
sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a concentration-response curve and permit an acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimation of the median lethal concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, testers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall use at least three different concentration levels, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control exposure group, to determine a concentration-response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship. Concentrations shall be spaced appropriately to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration-response data may also be sufficient to determine a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAEL, unless the result of a limit test precludes such findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria for selecting concentration levels has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published (40 CFR 798.2450 and 798.3260). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The highest concentration shall result in toxic effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful evaluation of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The lowest concentration shall not produce toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects which are directly attributable to the test exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where there is a useful estimation of human exposure, the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration shall exceed this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The intermediate concentration level(s) shall produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration level is used, the concentrations shall be spaced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to produce a gradation of toxic effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) In the low, intermediate, and control exposure groups, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the incidence of fatalities shall be low to absent, so as not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preclude a meaningful evaluation of the results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Exposure chamber environmental conditions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following environmental conditions in the exposure chamber are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical to the maintenance of the test animals: flow; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature; relative humidity; lighting; and noise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Filtered and conditioned air shall be used during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, to dilute the exhaust emissions, and during non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure periods to maintain environmental conditions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free of trace gases, dusts, and microorganisms on the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals. Twelve to fifteen air changes per hour will be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at all times to whole-body-exposure chambers. The minimum air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate for head/nose-only exposure chambers will be a function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the number of animals and the average minute volume of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recommended temperature ranges will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used for establishing temperature conditions of whole-body- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure chambers. For rodents in whole-body-exposure chambers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recommended temperature is 22 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C +/^ 2 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C and for rabbits, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is 20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C +/^ 3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. Temperature ranges have not been established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for head/nose-only tubes; however, recommended maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature limits have been established at the Inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxicology Research Institute (see Barr, 1988 in paragraph (f)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section). Maximum temperature for rats and mice in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
head/nose-only tubes is 23 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relative humidity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The relative humidity in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber air is important for heat balance and shall be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 40 percent and 60 percent, but in certain instances, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be practicable. Testers shall follow 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a 30 percent to 70 percent relative humidity range for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rodents in exposure chambers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lighting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Light intensity of 30 foot candles at 3 ft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the floor of the exposure facility is recommended (see Rao, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986 in paragraph (f)(16) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exposure Conditions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Study animals shall be exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test atmosphere on a repeated basis for at least 6 hours per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day on a 7-day per week basis for the exposure period. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based primarily on practical considerations, exposure on a 5-day-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per-week basis for a minimum of 6 hours per day is the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable exposure period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exposure atmosphere.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The exposure atmosphere shall be held as constant as is practicable and must be monitored continuously or intermittently,
depending on the method of analysis, to ensure that exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels are at the target values or within stated limits during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exposure period. Sampling methodology will be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the type of generation system and the type of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber system specified for the exposure study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Integrated samples of test atmosphere aerosol shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken daily during the exposure period from a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample port in the chamber near the breathing zone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the animals. Gas samples shall be taken daily to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations (ppm) of the major vapor components of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere including CO, CO

, and total hydrocarbons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To ensure that animals in different locations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber receive a similar exposure atmosphere, distribution of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aerosol or vapor concentration in exposure chambers can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined without animals during the developmental phase of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study, or it can be determined with animals early in the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For head/nose-only exposure chambers, it may not be possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the chamber distribution during the exposure, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure port contains the animal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) During the development of the emissions generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, particle size analysis shall be performed to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stability of an aerosol concentration with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particle size. Over the course of the exposure, analysis shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be conducted as often as is necessary to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency of particle size distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chamber rise and fall times.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rise time required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the exposure concentration to reach 90 percent of the stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration after the generator is turned on, and the fall time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the chamber concentration decreases to 10 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable concentration after the generation system is stopped shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined in the developmental phase of the study. Time-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated samples collected for calculating exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations shall be taken after the rise time. The daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure time is exclusive of the rise or the fall time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Instrumentation used for a given study will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined based on the type of generation system and the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure chamber system specified for the exposure study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For exhaust studies, combustion gases shall be sampled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by collecting exposure air in bags and then analyzing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected air sample to determine major components of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion gas using gas analyzers. Exposure chambers can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be connected to gas analyzers directly by using sampling lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and switching valves. Samples can be taken more frequently using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the latter method. Aerosol instruments, such as photometers, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-integrated gravimetric determination may be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the stability of any aerosol concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For evaporative emission studies, concentration of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors can usually be determined by using a gas chromatograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(GC) and/or infrared (IR) spectrometry. Grab samples for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent sampling can be taken from the chamber by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bubble samplers with the appropriate solvent to collect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors, or by collecting a small volume of air in a syringe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intermediate or continuous monitoring of the chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration is also possible by connecting the chamber with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GC or IR detector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Monitoring chamber environmental conditions may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed by a computer system or by exposure system operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The flow-metering device used for the exposure chambers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be a continuous monitoring device, and actual flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements must be recorded at least every 30 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accuracy must be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 percent of full scale range. Measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air flow through the exposure chamber may be accomplished using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any device that has sufficient range to accurately measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air flow for the given chamber. Types of flow metering devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include rotameters, orifice meters, venturi meters, critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orifices, and turbinemeters (see Benedict, 1984 in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(4) and Spitzer, 1984 in paragraph (f)(17) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pressure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pressure measurement may be accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using manometers, electronic pressure transducers, magnehelics, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or similar devices (see Gillum, 1982 in paragraph (f)(10) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section). Accuracy of the pressure device must be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of full scale range. Pressure measurements must be continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recorded at least every 30 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Temperature.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The temperature of exposure chambers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be monitored continuously and recorded at least every 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes. Temperature may be measured using thermometers, RTD's, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermocouples, thermistors, or other devices (see Benedict, 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (f)(4) of this section). It is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate an alarm system into the temperature monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. The exposure operators must be notified by the alarm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system when the chamber temperature exceeds 26.7 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure must be discontinued and emergency procedures enacted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately reduce temperatures or remove test animals from high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature environment when chamber temperatures exceed 29 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accuracy of the temperature monitoring device will be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temperature range of 20&hyph;30 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relative humidity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The relative humidity of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chambers must be monitored continuously and recorded at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every 30 minutes. Relative humidity may be measured using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various devices (see Chaddock, 1985 in paragraph (f)(6) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Lighting shall be measured quarterly, or once at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning, middle, and end of the study for shorter studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Noise level in the exposure chamber(s) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured quarterly, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the study for shorter studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Oxygen content is critical, especially in nose-only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber systems, and shall be greater than or equal to 19 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the test cages. An oxygen sensor shall be located at a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position in the test chamber and a lower alarm limit of 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent shall be used to activate an alarm system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Safety procedures and requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially explosive test substance concentrations, care shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It is mandatory that the upper explosive limit (UEL) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and lower explosive limit (LEL) for the fuel and/or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive(s) that are being tested be determined. These limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be found in the material safety data sheets (MSDS) for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance and in various reference texts. The air concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the fuel or additive-base fuel mixture in the generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, dilution/delivery system, and the exposure chamber system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be calculated to ensure that explosive limits are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Storage, handling, and use of fuels or fuel/additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixtures shall follow guidelines given in 29 CFR 1910.106. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Monitoring for carbon monoxide (CO) levels is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory for combustion systems. CO shall be continuously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored in the immediate area of the engine/vehicle system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the exposure chamber(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Air samples shall be taken quarterly in the immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area of the vapor generation system and the exposure chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for shorter studies. These samples shall be analyzed by methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) With the presence of fuels and/or fuel additives, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical and electronic equipment must be grounded. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution/delivery system and chamber exposure system must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounded. Guidelines for grounding are given in 29 CFR 1910.304.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard operating procedures (SOPs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SOPs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure operations, sampling instruments, animal handling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical methods shall be written during the developmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Technicians/operators shall be trained in exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, maintenance, and documentation, as appropriate, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their training shall be documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Flow meters, sampling instruments, and balances used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the inhalation experiments shall be calibrated with standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the developmental phase to determine their sensitivity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detection limits, and linearity. During the exposure period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments shall be checked for calibration and documented to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that each instrument still functions properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The mean exposure concentration shall be within 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the target concentration on 90 percent or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure days. The coefficient of variation shall be within 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of target on 90 percent or more of exposure days. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, a manufacturer might determine a mean exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of its product's exposure emissions by identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``marker'' compound(s) typical of the emissions of the fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel/additive mixture under study as a surrogate for the total of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual compounds in those exposure emissions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer would note any concentration changes in the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``marker'' compound(s) in the sample's daily emissions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The spatial variation of the chamber concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be 10 percent, or less. If a higher spatial variation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed during the developmental phase, then air mixing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber shall be increased. In any case, animals shall be rotated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the various cages in the exposure chamber(s) to insure each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Evaluation of results. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The findings of an inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed toxic effects and the necropsy and histopathological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings. The evaluation will include the relationship between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concentration of the test atmosphere and the duration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, and the severity of abnormalities, gross lesions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortality and any other general or specific toxic effects.

General toxicity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subchronic inhalation study is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to determine a concentration-response relationship for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential toxic effects in rats resulting from continuous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated inhalation exposure to vehicle/engine emissions over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of 90 days. A subgroup of perfusion-fixed animals is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required, in addition to the main study population, for more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exacting organ and tissue histology. This test will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening information on target organ toxicities and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration levels useful for running chronic studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing exposure criteria. Initial information on effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations/exposures of the test atmosphere may be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the literature of previous studies or through concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range-finding trials prior to starting this study. This health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects screening test is not capable of directly determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those effects which have a long latency period for development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., carcinogenicity and life-shortening), though it may permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the detremination of a no-observed-adverse-effect level, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAEL.

Specific health effects assessments (HEAs). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental studies are designed to determine the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive/teratologic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effect outcomes from vehicle/engine emission exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They are done in combination with the subchronic toxicity study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and paragraph (c) of this section or may be done separately as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlined by the appropriate test guideline.

potential health hazards to the fetus arising from the mother's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated exposure to vehicle/engine emissions before and during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her pregnancy. By including a mating of test animals, the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides preliminary data on the effects of repeated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration used in a test which produces no observed adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects. A NOAEL is expressed in terms of weight or volume of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test substance given daily per unit volume of air (&mu;g/L or ppm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subchronic inhalation toxicity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the adverse effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring as a result of the continuous or repeated daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of experimental animals to a chemical by inhalation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part (approximately 10 percent) of a life span.

Principle of the test method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As long as none of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of any study are violated by the combination, one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more HEAs may be combined with the general toxicity study through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent exposures of their study populations and/or by sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis of the same animal subjects. Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duplicated in combined studies need not be repeated. Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for combining HEAs with the general toxicity study are as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fertility assessment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The number of study animals in the test population is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased when the fertility assessment is run concurrently with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 90-day toxicity study. A minimum of 40 females per test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group shall undergo vaginal lavage daily for two weeks before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start of the exposure period. The resulting wet smears are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined to cull those animals which are acyclic. Twenty-five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
females shall be randomly assigned to a for-breeding group with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the balance of females assigned to a group for histopathologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All test groups are exposed over a period of 90 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to various concentrations of the test atmosphere for a minimum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six hours per day. After seven weeks of exposures, analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaginal cell smears shall resume on a daily basis for the 25 for-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breeding females and shall continue for a period of four weeks or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until each female in the group is confirmed pregnant. Following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ninth week of exposures, each for-breeding female is housed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overnight with a single study male. Matings shall continue for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as long as two weeks, or until pregnancy is confirmed (pregnancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day 0). Pregnant females are only exposed through day 15 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their pregnancy while daily exposures continue throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of the study for non-pregnant females and study males. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) On pregnancy day 20, pregnant females are sacrificed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and their uteri are examined. Pregnancy status and fetal effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are recorded as described in &sect;79.63. At the end of the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, all males and non-pregnant females are sacrificed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necropsied. Testes and epididymal tissue samples are taken from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five perfusion-fixed test subjects and histopathological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations are carried out on the remainder of the non-pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
females and study males. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C/M) assessment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined with the subchronic toxicity study, the main study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population is used to perform both the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 MN and SCE assays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the constant turnover of the cells to be analyzed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these assays, a separate study population may be used for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment. A study population needs only to be exposed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum of four weeks. At exposure's end, ten animals per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure and control groups are anaesthetized and heart punctures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are performed on all members. After separating blood components, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual lymphocyte cell cultures are set up for SCE analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One femur from each study subject is also removed and the marrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extracted. The marrow is smeared onto a glass slide, and stained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for analysis of micronuclei in erythrocytes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neurotoxicity (NTX) measures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) When combined with this subchronic toxicity study, test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals designated for whole-body perfusion fixation/lung 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histology and exposed as part of the main animal population are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to perform the neurohistology portion of these measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the last exposure period, a minimum of ten animals from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each exposure group shall be preserved 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with fixative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections of brain, spinal cord, and proximal sciatic or tibial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nerve are then cut, processed further in formalin, and mounted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for viewing under a light microscope. Fibers from the sciatic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tibial nerve sample are teased apart for further analysis under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GFAP assay. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the last exposure period, a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ten rodents from each exposure group shall be sacrificed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their brains excised and divided into regions. The tissue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples are then applied to filter paper, washed with anti-GFAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibody, and visualized with a radio-labelled Protein A. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filters are quantified for degree of immunoreactivity between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibody and GFAP in the tissue samples. A non-radioactive ELISA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format is also referenced in the GFAP guideline cited in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section. Note: Because the GFAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assay requires fresh, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
non-preserved, brain tissue, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of test animals may need to be increased to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate number of test subjects to complete the histopathology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of both the GFAP and the general toxicity portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 90-day inhalation study.

(iii) The start of the exposure period for the NTX measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study population may be staggered from that of the main study

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clinical examinations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The following examinations shall be performed on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twenty animals designated as the 90-day study population, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive of pregnant dams and those study animals targeted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perfusion by gravity: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The following hematology determinations shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried out at least two times during the test period (after 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of exposure and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the exposure period): hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of clotting potential such as prothrombin time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thromboplastin time, or platelet count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Clinical biochemistry determinations on blood shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried out at least two times during the test period, after 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of exposure and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the exposure period, on all groups of animals including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent controls. Clinical biochemical testing shall include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liver and kidney function. The selection of specific tests will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be influenced by observations on the mode of action of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance. In the absence of more specific tests, the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations may be made: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium, potassium, fasting glucose (with period of fasting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the species), serum alanine aminotransferase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serum aspartate aminotransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, gamma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen, blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creatinine, methemoglobin, bile acids, total bilirubin, and total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serum protein measurements. Additional clinical biochemistry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of observed effects, e.g., analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance, and cholinesterase activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The following examinations shall initially be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed on the high concentration and control groups only: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the test substance and at the termination of the study. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the eyes are detected, all animals shall be examined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Urinalysis is not required on a routine basis, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be done when there is an indication based on expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or observed toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Preservation by whole-body perfusion of fixative into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study designed to provide information on potential health hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the fetus arising from the mother's repeated inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to vehicle/engine emissions before and during her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy. By including a mating of test animals, the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides preliminary data on the effects of repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle/engine emissions exposure on gonadal function, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conception, and fertility. Since this is a one-generation test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ends with examination of full-term fetuses, but not of live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pups, it is not capable of determining effects on reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development which would only be detected in viable offspring of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated parents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the potential for adverse exposure effects on the regularity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the animal's cycle. In the rat, common cell types found in

the smears correlate well with the various stages of the estrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle and to changes occurring in the reproductive tract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Principle of the test method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) For a two week period before exposures start, daily vaginal cell smears are examined from a surplus of female test
animals to identify and cull those females which are acyclic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After culling, testers shall randomly assign at each exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration (including unexposed) a minimum of twenty-five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
females for breeding and fifteen non-bred females for later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histologic evaluation. Test animals shall be exposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhalation to graduated concentrations of the test atmosphere for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum of six hours per day over the next 13 weeks. Males and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
females in both test and control groups are mated after nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks of exposure. Exposures for pregnant females continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through gestation day 15, while exposures for males and all non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant females shall continue for the full exposure period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Beginning two weeks before the start of the mating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, daily vaginal smears resume for all to-be-bred females to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize their estrous cycles. This will continue for four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks or until a rat's pregnancy is confirmed, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, day 0, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of sperm in the cell smear. On pregnancy day 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shortly before the expected date of delivery, each pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
female is sacrificed, her uterus removed, and the contents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined for embryonic or fetal deaths, and live fetuses. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the exposure period, males and all non-pregnant females 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be weighed, and various organs and tissues, as appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be removed and weighed, fixed with stain, and sectioned for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viewing under a light microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) This assay may be done separately or in combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.62.

Limit test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a test at one dose level of the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4 micrometers (&mu;m) or less, using the procedures described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 79.60 of this part produces no observable toxic effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and if toxicity would not be expected based upon data of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structurally related compounds, then a full study using three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though may indicate the need for a higher dose level.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Species and strain.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rat is the preferred species. Strains with low fecundity shall not be used and the candidate species shall be characterized
for its sensitivity to developmental toxins. If another rodent species is used, the tester shall provide justification
for its selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Animals shall be a minimum of 10 weeks old at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start of the exposure period.

Number and sex.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each test and control group shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a minimum of 25 males and 40 females. In order to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that sufficient pups are produced to permit meaningful evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the potential developmental toxicity of the test substance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twenty pregnant test animals are required for each exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control level.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Observation period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The observation period shall be 13

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concentration levels and concentration selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) To select the appropriate concentration levels, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Since pregnant animals
have an increased minute ventilation as compared to non-pregnant animals, it is recommended that the trial study
be conducted in pregnant animals. Similarly, since presumably the minute ventilation will vary with progression
of pregnancy, the animals should be exposed during the same period of gestation as in the main study. It is not always
necessary, though, to carry out a trial study in pregnant animals. Comparisons between the results of a trial study
in non-pregnant animals, and the main study in pregnant animals will demonstrate whether or not the test substance
is more toxic in pregnant animals. In the trial study, the concentration producing embryonic or fetal lethalities
or maternal toxicity should be determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The highest concentration level shall induce some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overt maternal toxicity such as reduced body weight or body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight gain, but not more than 10 percent maternal deaths. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) The lowest concentration level shall not produce any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grossly observable evidence of either maternal or developmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The duration of exposure shall be at least six hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily, allowing appropriate additional time for chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equilibrium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Where an exposure chamber is used, its design shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize crowding of the test animals. This is best accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by individual caging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Pregnant animals shall not be subjected to beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum amount of stress. Since whole-body exposure appears to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general oronasal or head-only exposure, which is sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not recommended because of the associated stress accompanying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the restraining of the animals. However, there may be specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. The tester shall provide justification/reasoning for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Measurements shall be made at least every other day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food consumption for all animals in the study. Males and females 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be weighed on the first day of exposure and 2&hyph;3 times per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
week thereafter, except for pregnant dams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) The test animal housing, mating, and exposure chambers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be operated on a twenty-four hour lighting schedule, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twelve hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Test animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure shall only occur during the light portion of the cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vi) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed including the time of onset, degree, and duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vii) Females showing signs of abortion or premature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery shall be sacrificed and subjected to a thorough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
macroscopic examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (viii) Animals that die or are euthanized because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morbidity will be necropsied promptly.

Vaginal cytology.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) For a two week period before the mating period starts, each female in the to-be-bred population shall undergo a
daily saline vaginal lavage. Two wet cell smears from this lavage shall be examined daily for each subject to determine
a baseline pattern of estrus. Testers shall avoid excessive handling and roughness in obtaining the vaginal cell
samples, as this may induce a condition of pseudo-pregnancy in the test animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) This will continue for four weeks or until day 0 of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rat's pregnancy is confirmed by the presence of sperm in the cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smear.

Mating and fertility assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Beginning nine weeks after the start of exposure, each exposed and control group female (exclusive of the histology
group females) shall be paired during non-exposure hours with a male from the same exposure concentration group.
Matings shall continue for a period of two weeks, or until all mated females are determined to be pregnant. Mating pairs
shall be clearly identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Each morning, including weekends, cages shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined for the presence of a sperm plug. When found, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall mark gestation day 0 and pregnancy shall be confirmed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of sperm in the day's wet vaginal cell smears. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Two weeks after mating is begun, or as females are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be pregnant, bred animals are returned to pre-mating housing. Daily exposures continues through gestation
day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 for all pregnant females or through the balance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure period for non-pregnant females and all males. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Those pairs which fail to mate shall be evaluated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the course of the study to determine the cause of the apparent

opportunities to mate with a proven fertile partner, histological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of the reproductive organs, and, in males, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of the spermatogenic cycles. The stage of estrus for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each non-pregnant female in the breeding group will be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the end of the exposure period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation of results.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The findings of a developmental toxicity study shall be evaluated in terms of the observed effects and the exposure
levels producing effects. It is necessary to consider the historical developmental toxicity data on the species/strain
tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) There are several criteria for determining a positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result for reproductive/teratologic effects; a statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant dose-related decrease in the weight of the testes for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated subjects over control subjects, a decrease in neonatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viability, a significant change in the presence of soft tissue or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skeletal abnormalities, or an increased rate of embryonic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fetal resorption or death. Other criteria, e.g., lengthening of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estrous cycle or the time spent in any one stage of estrus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the proportion of viable male vs female fetuses or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offspring, the number and type of cells in vaginal smears, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathologic changes found during gross or microscopic examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of male or female reproductive organs may be based upon detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for that evaluation parameter. A positive result indicates that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the test conditions, the test substance does induce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive organ or fetal toxicity in the test species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) A test substance which does not produce either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant dose-related change in the reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organs or cycle or a statistically significant and reproducible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive response at any one of the test points may not induce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive organ toxicity in this test species, but further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation , e.g., to establish absorption and bioavailability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the test substance, should be considered.

 The micronucleus assay is an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cytogenetic test which uses erythrocytes in the bone marrow of rodents to detect chemical damage to the chromosomes
or mitotic apparatus of mammalian cells. As the erythroblast develops into an erythrocyte (red blood cell), its main
nucleus is extruded and may leave a micronucleus in the cell body; a few micronuclei form under normal conditions in
blood elements. This assay is based on an increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes found in bone marrow
from treated animals compared to that of control animals. The visualization of micronuclei is facilitated in these
cells because they lack a main nucleus.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Micronuclei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mean small particles consisting of acentric fragments of chromosomes or entire chromosomes, which lag behind at
anaphase of cell division. After telophase, these fragments may not be included in the nuclei of daughter cells and
form single or multiple micronuclei in the cytoplasm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Polychromatic erythrocyte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (PCE) means an immature red blood cell that, because it contains RNA, can be differentiated by appropriate staining
techniques from a normochromatic erythrocyte (NCE), which lacks RNA. In one to two days, a PCE matures into a NCE.

Principle of the test method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Groups of rodents are exposed by the inhalation route for a minimum of 6 hours/day over a period of not less than 28
days to three or more concentrations of a test substance in air. Groups of animals are sacrificed at the end of the exposure
period and femoral bone marrow is extracted. The bone marrow is then smeared onto glass slides, stained, and PCEs are
scored for micronuclei. Researchers may need to run a trial at the highest tolerated concentration of the test atmosphere
to optimize the sample collection time for micronucleated cells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) This assay may be done separately or in combination with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions
in &sect;79.62.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Species and strain.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The rat is the recommended test animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use of that species will
be justified by the tester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a strain of mouse is used in this assay, the tester shall sample peripheral blood from an appropriate site on
the test animal, e.g., the tail vein, as a source of normochromatic erythrocytes. Results shall be reported as outlined
later in this guideline with ``normochromatic'' interchanged for ``polychromatic'', where specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Animal number and sex.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At least five female and five male animals per experimental/sample and control group shall be used. The use of a single
sex or a smaller number of animals shall be justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Positive control group.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A single concentration of a compound known to produce micronuclei 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is adequate as a positive control if it shows a significant response at any one time point; additional concentration
levels may be used. To select an appropriate concentration level, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Initially,
one concentration of the test substance may be used, the maximum tolerated dose or that producing some indication
of toxicity, e.g., a drop in the ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes. Intraperitoneal injection
of 1,2-dimethyl-benz-anthracene or benzene are examples of positive control exposures. A concentration of 50&hyph;80
percent of an LD50 may be a suitable guide.

Preparation of slides and sampling times.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Within twenty-four hours of the last exposure, test animals will be sacrificed. One femur from each test animal will
be removed and placed in fetal bovine serum. The bone marrow is removed, cells processed, and two bone marrow smears
are made for each animal on glass microscope slides. The slides are stained with acridine- orange (AO) or another appropriate
stain (Giemsa + Wright's, etc.) and examined under a microscope.

In addition to the reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specified under &sect;&sect;79.60 and 79.61, the final test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report must include the criteria for scoring micronuclei. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual data shall be presented in a tabular form including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both positive and negative controls and experimental groups. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of polychromatic erythrocytes scored, the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micronucleated erythrocytes, the percentage of micronucleated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells, and, where applicable, the percentage of micronucleated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erythrocytes shall be listed separately for each experimental and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control animal. Absolute numbers shall be included if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentages are reported.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interpretation of data. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) There are several criteria for determining a positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, one of which is a statistically significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polychromatic erythrocytes. Another criterion may be based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detection of a reproducible and statistically significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive response for at least one of the test substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or a statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test points is considered nonmutagenic in this system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test evaluation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Positive results in the micronucleus test provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the ability of a chemical to induce micronuclei in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erythrocytes of the test species under the conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. This damage may have been the result of chromosomal damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or damage to the mitotic apparatus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions the test substance does not produce micronuclei in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bone marrow of the test species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C-metaphase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a state of arrested cell growth typically seen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after treatment with a spindle inhibitor, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Sister chromatid exchange 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a reciprocal interchange of the

two chromatid arms within a single chromosome. This exchange is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visualized during the metaphase portion of the cell cycle and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumably requires the enzymatic incision, translocation and

Principle of the test method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Groups of rodents are exposed by the inhalation route 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a minimum of 6 hours/day over a period of not less than 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days to three or more concentrations of a test substance in air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Groups of animals are sacrificed at the end of the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period and blood lymphocyte cell cultures are prepared from study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals. Cell growth is suspended after a time and cells are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested, fixed and stained before scoring for SCEs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Researchers may need to run a trial at the highest tolerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the test atmosphere to optimize the sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection time for second division metaphase cells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) This assay may be done separately or in combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.62. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The method described here employs peripheral blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lymphocytes (PBL) of laboratory rodents exposed to the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Within twenty-four hours of the last exposure, test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal lymphocytes are obtained by heart puncture and duplicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cell cultures are started for each animal. Cultures are grown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and then a spindle inhibitor (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colchicine) is added to arrest cell growth. Cells are harvested, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed, and stained and their chromosomes are scored for SCEs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Species and strain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rat is the recommended test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that species will be justified by the tester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Animal number and sex. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At least five female and five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
male animals per experimental and control group shall be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of a single sex or different number of animals shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified.

Positive control group.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A single concentration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound known to produce SCEs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is adequate as a positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control if it shows a significant response at any one time point; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional concentration levels may be used. To select an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate concentration level, a pilot or trial study may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advisable. Initially, one concentration of the test substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used, the maximum tolerated dose or that producing some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication of toxicity as evidenced by animal morbidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including death) or target cell toxicity. Intraperitoneal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injection of 1,2-dimethyl-benz-anthracene or benzene are examples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of positive control exposures. A concentration of 50&hyph;80 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an LD50 would also be a suitable guide.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the conclusion of the exposure period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all test animals are anaesthetized and heart punctures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed. Lymphocytes are isolated over a Ficoll gradient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replicate cell cultures are started for each animal. After some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 hours, the cells are treated with BrdU and returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incubation. The following day, a spindle inhibitor (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colchicine) is added to arrest cell growth in c-metaphase. Cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are harvested 4 hours later and second-division metaphase cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are washed and fixed in methanol:acetic acid, stained, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chromosome preparations are scored for SCEs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interpretation of results.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the number of SCE. Another criterion may be based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive response for at least one of the test concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A test substance which does not produce either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The histopathological and biochemical techniques in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this guideline are designed to develop data in animals on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphologic changes in the nervous system associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated inhalation exposures to motor vehicle emissions. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests are not intended to provide a detailed evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. Neuropathological evaluation should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complemented by other neurotoxicity studies, e.g. behavioral and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiological studies and/or general toxicity testing, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more completely assess the neurotoxic potential of an exposure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Principle of the test method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Laboratory rodents are exposed to one of several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration levels of a test atmosphere for at least six hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily over a period of 90 days. At the end of the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the animals are anaesthetized, perfused 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixative, and tissues in the nervous system are examined grossly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and prepared for microscopic examination. Starting with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest dosage level, tissues are examined under the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope for morphologic changes, until a no-observed-adverse-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect level is determined. In cases where light microscopy has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revealed neuropathology, the NOAEL may be confirmed by electron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The tests described herein may be combined with any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other toxicity study, as long as none of the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either are violated by the combination. Specifically, this assay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be combined with a subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in &sect;79.62. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limit test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a test at one dose level of the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4 micrometers (&mu;m) or less, using the procedures described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a) of this section, produces no observable toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects and if toxicity would not be expected based upon data of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structurally related compounds, then a full study using three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though may indicate the need for a higher dose level.

species being used in other NTX tests. A standard strain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory rat is recommended. The choice of species shall take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into consideration such factors as the comparative metabolism of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for combined studies, and the availability of other

air only, is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The laboratory performing the testing shall provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive control data, e.g., results from repeated acrylamide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, as evidence of the ability of their histology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to detect neurotoxic endpoints. Positive control data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be collected at the time of the test study unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory can demonstrate the adequacy of historical data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the planned study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) A satellite group of 10 female and 10 male test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects shall be treated with the highest concentration level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the duration of the exposure and observed thereafter for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of the techniques outlined for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sacrifice of animals and preparation of tissues is preservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tissue morphology to simulate the living state of the cell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Animals shall be perfused 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a generally recognized technique. For fixation suitable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light or electronic microscopy, saline solution followed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buffered 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde or buffered 4.0 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paraformaldehyde, is recommended. While some minor modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or variations in procedures are used in different laboratories, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed and standard procedure for vascular perfusion may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the text by Zeman and Innes (1963), Hayat (1970), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spencer and Schaumburg (1980) under paragraph (g) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. A more sophisticated technique is described by Palay and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of this section.

Removal of brain and cord. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After perfusion, the bony 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure (cranium and vertebral column) shall be exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animals shall then be stored in fixative-filled bags at 4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8&hyph;12 hours. The cranium and vertebral column shall be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully by trained technicians without physical damage of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brain and cord. Detailed dissection procedures may be found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the text by Palay and Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. After removal, simple measurement of the size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(length and width) and weight of the whole brain (cerebrum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cerebellum, pons-medulla) shall be made. Any abnormal coloration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or discoloration of the brain and cord shall also be noted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All tissue specimens shall be washed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 1 hour with water or buffer, prior to dehydration. (A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer washing time is needed if the specimens have been stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in fixative for a prolonged period of time.) Dehydration can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed with increasing concentration of graded ethanols up to

on standard glass slides. It is recommended that several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional sections be made from each block at this time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible future needs for special stainings. All tissue blocks

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical-induced injury of the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the brain, is associated with astrocytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hypertrophy at the site of damage (see O'Callaghan, 1988 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e)(3) in this section). Assays of glial fibrillary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acidic protein (GFAP), the major intermediate filament protein of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
astrocytes, can be used to document this response. To date, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse variety of chemical insults known to be injurious to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central nervous system have been shown to increase GFAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, increases in GFAP can be seen at concentrations below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those necessary to produce cytopathology as determined by routine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissl stains (standard neuropathology). Thus it appears that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assays of GFAP represent a sensitive approach for documenting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence and location of chemical-induced injury of the central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system. Additional functional, histopathological, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biochemical tests are necessary to assess completely the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic potential of any chemical. This biochemical test is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to be used in conjunction with neurohistopathological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Principle of the test method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) This guideline describes the conduct of a radioimmunoassay for measurement of the amount of GFAP in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brain of vehicle emission-exposed and unexposed control animals. It is based on modifications (O'Callaghan &amp;
Miller 1985 in paragraph (e)(5), O'Callaghan 1987 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the dot-immunobinding
procedure described by Jahn 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Briefly, brain tissue samples from study animals are assayed for total
protein, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diluted in dot-immunobinding buffer, and applied to nitrocellulose sheets. The spotted sheets are then fixed, blocked,
washed and incubated in anti-GFAP antibody and [I
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
125
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] Protein A. Bound protein A is then quantified by gamma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrometry. In lieu of purified protein standards, standard curves are constructed from dilution of a single control
sample. By comparing the immunoreactivity of individual samples (both control and exposed groups) with that of the
sample used to generate the standard curve, the relative immunoreactivity of each sample is obtained. The immunoreactivity
of the control groups is normalized to 100 percent and all data are expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a percentage of control. A variation on this radioimmunoassay procedure has been proposed (O'Callaghan 1991 in paragraph
(e)(4) of this section) which uses a ``sandwich'' of GFAP, anti-GFAP, and a chromophore in a microtiter plate format
enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The use of this variation shall be justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) This assay may be done separately or in combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Tissue Preparation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Animals are euthanized 24 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the last exposure and the brain is excised from the skull. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On a cold dissecting platform, the following six regions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissected freehand: cerebellum; cerebral cortex; hippocampus; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
striatum; thalamus/hypothalamus; and the rest of the brain. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region is then weighed and homogenized in 10 volumes of hot (70&hyph;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) 1 percent (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homogenization is best achieved through sonic disruption. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor driven pestle inserted into a tissue grinding vessel is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable alternative. The homogenized samples can then be stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frozen at ^70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

Preparation of Nitrocellulose Sheets. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nitrocellulose sheets of 0.1 or 0.2 micron pore size are rinsed by immersion in distilled water for 5 minutes and then
air dried.

Sample Application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples can be spotted onto the nitrocellulose sheets free-hand or with the aid of a template. For free-hand application,
draw a grid of squares approximately 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters (cm) on the nitrocellulose sheets using a soft
pencil. Spot 5&hyph;10 &mu;l portions to the center of each square for a total sample volume of 20 &mu;l. For template
aided sample application a washerless microliter capacity sample application manifold is used. Position the nitrocellulose
sheet in the sample application device as recommended by the manufacturer and spot a 20 &mu;l sample in one application.
Do not wet the nitrocellulose or any support elements prior to sample application. Do not apply vacuum during or after
sample application. After spotting samples (using either method), let the sheets air dry. The sheets can be stored
at room temperature for several days after sample application.

et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. All steps are carried out at room temperature on a flat shaking platform
(one complete excursion every 2&hyph;3 seconds). For best results, do not use rocking or orbital shakers. Perform
the following steps in enough solution to cover the nitrocellulose sheets to a depth of 1 cm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Incubate 20 minutes in fixer (25 percent (v/v) isopropanol, 10 percent (v/v) acetic acid). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Discard fixer, wash several times in deionized water to eliminate the fixer, and then incubate for 5 minutes in
Tris-buffered saline (TBS): 200 mM NaCL, 60 mM Tris-HCl to pH 7.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Discard TBS and incubate 1 hour in blocking solution (0.5 percent gelatin (w/v)) in TBS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 2 hours in antibody solution (anti-GFAP antiserum diluted to the desired
dilution in blocking solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X&hyph;100). Serum anti-bovine GFAP, which cross reacts
with GFAP from rodents and humans, can be obtained commercially (e.g., Dako Corp.) and used at a dilution of 1:500.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Discard antibody solution, and wash in 4 changes of TBS for 5 minutes each time. Then wash in TBS for 10 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Discard TBS and incubate in blocking solution for 30 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 1 hour in Protein A solution ([I125]-labeled Protein A diluted in blocking
solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X&hyph;100, sufficient to produce 2000 counts per minute (cpm) per 10 &mu;l
of Protein A solution). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) Remove Protein A solution (it may be reused once). Wash in 0.1 percent Triton X&hyph;100 in TBS (TBSTX) for 5 minutes,
4 times. Then wash in TBSTX for 2&hyph;3 hours for 4 additional times. An overnight wash in a larger volume can be used
to replace the last 4 washes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) Hang sheets to air-dry. Cut out squares or spots and count radioactivity in a gamma counter.

Expression of data. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare radioactivity counts for samples obtained from control and treated animals with counts obtained from the
standard curve. By comparing the immunoreactivity (counts) of each sample with that of the standard curve, the relative
amount of GFAP in each sample can be determined and expressed as a percent of control.

(i) Results shall be evaluated in terms of the extent of change in the amount of GFAP as a function of treatment and dose.
GFAP assays (of any brain region) from a minimum of 6 samples typically will result in a standard error of the mean of
+/^ 5 percent. In this case, a chemically-induced increase in GFAP of 115 percent of control is likely to be statistically
significant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Motor vehicle combustion emissions from

trap semi-volatile gases. Bacteria are separately exposed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extract from both the filtered particulates and the resin-trapped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics. Assays are conducted using both test mixtures with and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without a metabolic activation system and exposed cells are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plated onto minimal medium. After a suitable period of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five tester strains shall be used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assay. At the present time, TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as tester strains. The fifth strain will be chosen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the pool of Salmonella strains commonly used to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the degree to which nitrated organic compounds, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitroarenes, contribute to the overall mutagenic activity of a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognized methods of stock culture preparation and storage shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used. The requirement of histidine for growth shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated for each strain. Other phenotypic characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be checked using such methods as crystal violet sensitivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and resistance to ampicillin. Spontaneous reversion frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be in the range expected as reported in the literature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as established in the laboratory by historical control values.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bacteria shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to the test substance both in the presence and absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an appropriate exogenous metabolic activation system. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct plate incorporation method, the most commonly used system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a cofactor-supplemented postmitochondrial fraction prepared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the livers of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as Aroclor 1254. For the azo-reduction method, a cofactor- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemented postmitochondrial fraction (S&hyph;9) prepared from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
livers of untreated hamsters is preferred. For this method, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cofactor supplement shall contain flavin mononucleotide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exogenous glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADH and excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glucose-6-phosphate.

Positive controls to ensure the efficacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activation system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The positive control reference substances for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests including a metabolic activation system shall be selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of the type of activation system used in the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-Aminoanthracene is an example of a positive control compound in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plate-incorporation tests using postmitochondrial fractions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the livers of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aroclor-1254. Congo red is an example of a positive control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound in the azo-reduction method. Other positive control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-coated glass fiber filters using an exhaust dilution setup. The particulates are extracted with dichloromethane
(DCM) using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Soxhlet extraction techniques. Extracts in DCM can be stored at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry ice temperatures until use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Gaseous hydrocarbons passing through the filter are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trapped by a porous, polymer resin, like XAD&hyph;2/styrene-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divinylbenzene, or an equivalent product. Methylene chloride is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to extract the resin and the sample is evaporated to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before storage or use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Samples taken from this material are then used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expose the cells in this assay. Final concentration of extracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in solvent/vehicle, or after solvent exchange, shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with cell viability or growth rate. The paper by Stump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1982) in paragraph (g) of this section is useful for preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extracts of particulate and semi-volatile organic compounds from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel and gasoline exhaust stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Exposure concentrations. (A) The test should initially be performed over a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of concentrations. Among the criteria to be taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration for determining the upper limits of test substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration are cytotoxicity and solubility. Cytotoxicity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test chemical may be altered in the presence of metabolic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activation systems. Toxicity may be evidenced by a reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of spontaneous revertants, a clearing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background lawn or by the degree of survival of treated cultures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relatively insoluble samples shall be tested up to the limits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solubility. The upper test chemical concentration shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined on a case by case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Generally, a maximum of 5 mg/plate for pure substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered acceptable. At least 5 different concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test substance shall be used with adequate intervals between test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When appropriate, a single positive response shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed by testing over a narrow range of concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Test performance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All data developed within this study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;79.60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Direct plate incorporation method. When testing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolic activation, test solution, bacteria, and 0.5 ml of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activation mixture containing an adequate amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postmitochondrial fraction shall be added to the liquid overlay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agar and mixed. This mixture is poured over the surface of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selective agar plate. Overlay agar shall be allowed to solidify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before incubation. At the end of the incubation period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revertant colonies per plate shall be counted. When testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without metabolic activation, the test sample and 0.1 ml of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fresh bacterial culture shall be added to 2.0 ml of overlay agar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Azo-reduction method. When testing with metabolic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activation, 0.5 ml of activation mixture containing 150 &mu;l of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postmitochondrial fraction and 0.1 ml of bacterial culture shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be added to a test tube kept on ice. 0.1 ml of test solution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be added, and the tubes shall be incubated with shaking at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 30 minutes. At the end of the incubation period, 2.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ml of agar shall be added to each tube, the contents mixed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poured over the surface of a selective agar plate. Overlay agar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be allowed to solidify before incubation. At the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incubation period, revertant colonies per plate shall be counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For tests without metabolic activation, 0.5 ml of buffer shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in place of the 0.5 ml of activation mixture. All other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures shall be the same as those used for the test with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolic activation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other methods/modifications may also be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) Media. An appropriate selective medium with an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlay agar shall be used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interpretation of results.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related
increase in the number of revertants. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically
significant positive response for at least one of the test substance concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number
of revertants or a statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the test points is considered
nonmutagenic in this system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Both biological and statistical significance shall be considered together in the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 reverse mutation assay indicate that, under the test conditions, the test substance induces point mutations by base
changes or frameshifts in the genome of this organism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the test substance is not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium.

. The final test rule was published on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262), and requires manufacturers and processors of 10 substances
to conduct testing for neurotoxicity. On October 8, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and the manufacturers
and processors of these substances filed suit seeking review of the rule in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. EPA is
announcing a stay of this rule as part of a settlement agreement reached with the manufacturers of these chemicals,
who have agreed to perform certain neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing on 7 of the 10 chemicals subject to
the final test rule, subject to execution of enforceable consent agreements (``ECA'') containing these studies.

. The manufacturers of 7 of the 10 chemicals subject to the final test rule have agreed, subject to certain conditions
set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct a set of neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing under
enforceable consent agreements (``ECA''). If ECA negotiations are successful, EPA believes that the previously
issued final test rule would no longer be needed. EPA believes that, under a negotiated ECA, neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics
testing would be conducted and results made publicly available more quickly, and EPA resources used more effectively,
than if EPA continued to litigate the merits of the final test rule. It is anticipated that the following seven substances
would be tested pursuant to ECAs: acetone (CAS No. 67&hyph;64&hyph;1), technical grade

I. Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262) EPA issued a test rule under TSCA section 4 that required manufacturers and processors
of 10 substances to conduct testing for neurotoxicity (Ref. 1). The required testing was the same for all 10 substances
and included acute and subchronic functional observational battery and motor activity, and subchronic neuropathology
and schedule-controlled operant behavior. These 10 substances are listed below:

The manufacturers of these substances petitioned for review of the final rule under TSCA section 19 in the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals (Ref. 2). Subsequent to the filing of this challenge to the rule, EPA, the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (``CMA''), and authorized representatives of all parties challenging the rule, entered into settlement
negotiations to resolve the lawsuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these settlement discussions, CMA and the other parties to the lawsuit have agreed, subject to certain
conditions set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing
of seven chemical substances under negotiated ECAs, to be implemented by an order issued by EPA under TSCA section
4. Testing on two of the chemicals subject to the final rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol, is already underway. It is CMA's stated intent that such testing continue on
schedule during the pendency of this proceeding (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In turn, EPA has agreed to propose to revoke the final test rule. The proposed revocation is published elsewhere in
this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and contains a more detailed explanation of EPA's decision with regard to the anticipated testing program. EPA is
aware that the settlement agreement contemplates a reduced set of testing on fewer chemicals than the testing regimen
required by the final rule. However, EPA believes that the settlement agreement is in the public interest as it will
allow testing to proceed on an expedited basis, without the uncertainties of protracted litigation. EPA notes that
although CMA's lawsuit has been dismissed without prejudice by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, in response to a joint
motion for a stay, it can be reinstated by either party upon filing of a letter with the court (Ref. 21).

 The test rule requires the submission of interim status reports every 6 months until the completion of testing, as
well as final reports and data once testing is complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The settlement agreement contemplates a testing program which would retain the full set of tests for three chemicals
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate), reduce the number of tests for four chemicals (acetone, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-amyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, and tetrahydrofuran), and eliminate testing of three chemicals (1-butanol,
diethyl ether, and 2-ethoxyethanol). It is anticipated, however, that the pharmacokinetics/metabolism test of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate may indicate that the separate testing of 1-butanol may not be necessary, and because of this 1-butanol
manufacturers have agreed to share in the cost of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate testing. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate of butyl acetate will be performed
in a study of its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hydrolysis to 1-butanol. If the conversion of butyl acetate to 1-butanol is sufficiently rapid and complete, EPA
may determine that the neurotoxic effects of 1-butanol can be predicted from the results of butyl acetate testing.
If this is not the case, EPA may consider reproposing separate testing of 1-butanol. EPA believes that this testing
would represent a reasonable compromise which could avoid protracted litigation while still developing relevant
data necessary to determine the neurotoxicity of these chemical substances.

III. Stay of Final Test Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is issuing this administrative stay of the final test rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 705, which authorizes an agency
to postpone the effective date or any deadlines imposed by administrative action taken by the agency when ``justice
so requires,'' pending judicial review. See also Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorizing
issuance of administrative stays pending review. (The need for and proper scope of neurotoxicity testing of the 10
chemical substances subject to the final test rule is at issue in litigation challenging the final rule. Although
the suit has been dismissed, it can be reinstated by either party upon filing of a letter with the Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals (Ref. 21).) EPA believes that issuance of a stay of the deadlines for submission of interim and final reports,
and final submissions of test data, is necessary pending resolution of all outstanding issues. In particular, EPA
believes that should ECAs be concluded, and testing conducted under orders incorporating such ECAs, the final rule
itself would be moot. Consequently, EPA finds issuance of this stay is in the interests of justice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA does not regard this administrative stay as a rule, were it to be viewed as a rule, to the extent good cause
(pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)) is needed to justify EPA's immediately effective stay of all deadlines in the final rule,
EPA believes that there is good cause for issuing it without prior notice and opportunity for comment and for making
it immediately effective. EPA believes that the impending deadlines for submission of interim status reports under
a rule that, pending public comment, may be rescinded, the ongoing testing that is being conducted even pending the
final outcome of negotiations for ECAs, EPA's solicitation of interested parties to monitor or participate in ECA
negotiations, and EPA's solicitation of comment on all other aspects of today's action, provide such good cause.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'');
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this
Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this order, EPA has determined that this stay would not be ``significant''.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection,
identification, certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. The proposed fee increases
reflect the increased costs of providing these services due primarily to the increase in salaries of Federal employees
allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The proposed fee increases reflect the increased costs of
providing certain inspection services due primarily to an increase in salaries of Federal employees allocated by
Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Since FSIS is required to recover the reimbursable
portion of the increase in employee salaries, FSIS is only providing a 30-day comment period for this proposed rule.

The Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).
The fees provided for in this document reflect only a minimal increase in the costs currently borne by those entities
which elect to utilize certain inspection services.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mandatory inspection by Federal inspectors of meat and poultry slaughtered and/or processed at official establishments
is provided for under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Such inspection is required to ensure the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat and poultry products;
the ordinary costs of inspection are borne by the U.S. Government. However, costs for these inspection services performed
on holidays or on an overtime basis may be incurred to accommodate the business needs of particular establishments.
All of these costs which are not a part of the mandatory inspection service are recoverable by the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each year the fees for certain services rendered to operators of official meat and poultry establishments, importers,
or exporters by FSIS are reviewed and a cost analysis is performed to determine if such fees are adequate to recover
the cost of providing the services.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The analysis relates to fees changed in connection with overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection,
identification, certification, or laboratory services. The proposed new fees discussed below were determined
by an analysis of data on the current cost of these services and by increases in costs due primarily to an increase in
the salaries of Federal employees allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990
which provided an average FSIS locality pay raise of 3.2 percent in January 1994. Other increases affecting Federal
employees, such as costs for benefits, are due to the increasing number of employees covered by the Federal Employees
Retirement System in 1994 which is subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, and increased health
insurance costs. Based on the Agency's analysis of the costs in providing these services, FSIS is proposing to increase
the fees relating to overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification, certification and
laboratory services.

9 CFR 307.5 of the Federal meat inspection regulations provides that FSIS shall be reimbursed for the cost of meat inspection
on holidays or on an overtime basis at the rate specified in 9 CFR 391.3, currently $30.72 per hour, per program employee.
Similarly, 9 CFR 381.38 of the poultry products inspection regulations provides that FSIS shall be reimbursed for
the cost of poultry inspection on holidays or on an overtime basis at the rate specified in 9 CFR 391.3, currently $30.72
per hour, per program employee. FSIS is proposing to increase the fee set forth in section 391.3 to $31.80 per hour,
per program employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS also provides a range of voluntary inspection and certification services (9 CFR 350.7, 351.8, 351.9, 352.5,
354.101, 355.12, and 362.5); the costs of which are totally recoverable by the Government. These services, provided
under Subchapter B_Voluntary Inspection and Certification Service_are provided under the Agricultural Marketing
Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

.) to assist in the orderly marketing of various animal products and byproducts not subject to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The base time rate for providing voluntary inspection and certification services is currently $29.84 per hour, per
program employee, as specified in 9 CFR 391.2. The overtime and holiday rate for voluntary inspection services is
currently $30.72 per hour, per program employee, as specified in 9 CFR 391.3. As stated above, these fees would be increased
to $31.12 per hour and $31.80 per hour, per program employee, respectively.

Petitioner: Gerald A. Silver
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations Affected: 14 CFR 91.119
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Description of Rulechange Sought:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To strike out the following language in subsection (d) of &sect;91.119: ``(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Helicopters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Helicopters may be operated at less than the minimum prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the operation
is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.'' Mr. Silver, on behalf of Homeowners of Encino,
proposes to add the following language in place of that deleted above: ``(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Helicopters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Helicopters operated by any municipal, county, state, or federal authority for emergency services, rescue operations,
police or fire protection, may be operated at less than the minimum prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section
if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.''

Petitioners's Reasons for the Request:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner(s) feels that the helicopter noise problem, created by low flying helicopters overflying his/their
community conducting sightseeing tours (particularly at night), real estate caravan flybys to show homes to prospective
customers, and other short distance business travel, is a flagrant abuse of the constituency represented by the petitioner(s).
It is a recurring problem that has not been, heretofore, relieved by means of a pilot/industry cooperative endeavor;
and the proposed rulemaking change would provide acceptable relief.

Description of Rulechange Sought:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To require that, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, helicopters operated over a congested area maintain
an altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft; helicopters
operated over non-congested areas would be required to maintain an altitude of 500 feet above the surface; and helicopters
operated over open water or sparsely populated areas would not be permitted closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel,
vehicle, or structure.

Petitioner's Reason for the Request:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner feels this change will increase the safety of helicopter operations by raising the altitude that they
fly; provide the Federal Aviation Administration greater authority to enforce minimum safe altitude regulations
similar to the provisions for all other aircraft; not unduly burden helicopter operators with increased costs or
loss of efficiency; and minimize the intrusion of helicopters in the community.

 This document withdraws proposed amendments to the

Customs Regulations which would have provided that a person, having received written notice from a Customs official
of the Customs designation of the duty/statistical reporting number for imported merchandise, must provide that
designation to Customs on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) or other applicable forms. The proposed amendments
also would have provided that a failure to furnish the required designation may subject the person to a claim for monetary
penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592. In view of the subsequent enactment of Customs modernization legislation which amended
the statutes upon which the published proposals were based, those proposals are now outdated and therefore should
be withdrawn.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 28, 1987, Customs published a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
 Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (52 FR 36279) proposing to amend &sect;141.61(e), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.61(e)) to provide that an importer
or customs broker, having received any of several specified types of written notice from a Customs official of the
Customs designation of the duty/statistical reporting number applicable to imported merchandise (or, in the case
of a broker, where the broker has actual knowledge that his importer-client received such notice), must provide that
designation to Customs on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) or other applicable forms filed by the importer or
broker. In addition, &sect;141.61(e) would have been amended to provide that a failure to provide the required designation
may subject the importer or broker to a claim for monetary penalty under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 1592). The document also proposed to amend &sect;177.8, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.8), by adding
thereto a cross-reference to the requirements in subpart E of part 141 relating to presentation of entry papers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of the proposed regulatory amendments, Customs noted at that time that: (1) Section 484(a)(1)(B), Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(1)(B)), required that an importer of record file with Customs documentation
to, among other things, enable a Customs officer to properly assess duties on imported merchandise, collect accurate
statistics, and determine whether any other applicable requirement of law is met; and (2) section 500, Tariff Act
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1500), placed the obligation on Customs to ``ascertain the classification and rate
of duty applicable to [imported] merchandise.'' Customs further pointed out that because of substantial increases
in annual import volume and as a result of the development of the Automated Commercial System (ACS), more accurate
reporting data had become necessary and Customs had to place increased reliance upon information contained in entry
documents. Thus, the proposed regulatory amendments, if adopted as a final rule, would have enabled Customs to better
carry out its statutory duty under 19 U.S.C. 1500 and would have assisted Customs in establishing one of the levels
of culpability necessary to constitute a violation under 19 U.S.C. 1592 in appropriate cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the subsequent adoption of Customs modernization legislation (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182,
107 Stat. 2057, 2170), the legal basis for the proposals set forth in the published document has been altered somewhat.
In this regard Customs notes that, in furtherance of the principle of informed compliance, sections 637 and 638 of
Public Law 103&hyph;182 amended 19 U.S.C. 1484 and 1500, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by shifting, from Customs to the importer of record, the legal responsibility for initially valuing, classifying
and determining the rate of duty applicable to imported merchandise and by imposing on the importer of record a ``reasonable
care'' standard in carrying out that responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the published proposals have become outdated by virtue of the statutory changes described above, Customs believes
it is preferable at this time to withdraw them. Customs intends to look at this matter further in connection with the

a view to possible publication of new proposals for public comment at a future date. Until any such further public notice

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Through an informal study group, MMS has conducted discussions to receive input on the current gas market and identify
the challenges facing royalty valuation of gas produced from Federal leases for royalty purposes. The discussions
have gone well and needs for regulatory changes have been identified. The MMS now believes that using a negotiated
rulemaking committee to make specific recommendations with respect to Federal gas valuation would help the agency
in developing a rulemaking. The Department is, therefore, establishing the Federal Gas Valuation Negotiated Rulemaking
Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the publication of the March 1, 1988, gas valuation regulations (30 CFR Part 206) many of MMS's constituents
have expressed concern about the current ``tracing method'' of valuing production from unit and communization agreements.
Of particular concern is determining the proper value, for royalty purposes, when the working interest owner sells
none of the production allocated to him under the agreement. Likewise, constituents have pointed out difficulties
with the current benchmark system utilized to value non-arm's-length and no-sales situations. Those difficulties
include issues of comparability, certainty, and access to information. As part of Vice President Gore's National
Performance Review (NPR), the Royalty Management Program recently initiated a Reinvention Laboratory Team to examine
ways to streamline the royalty management process. One of the recommendations of that team was to improve the valuation
benchmark system. The NPR Team recommended to the Royalty Management Advisory Committee (RMAC) that a pilot be conducted
to evaluate the use of spot prices as the second benchmark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In commenting on the recommendations of the NPR Team, RMAC recommended that the entire benchmark system be evaluated
and that the evaluation be limited to gas produced from Federal leases.

Statutory Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to FOGRMA (30 U.S.C. 1701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), 30 CFR Part 206 (1993) and Federal oil and gas lease and agreement terms, certain principles of royalty accounting
will form the basis for a proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume: Royalties must be paid each month on the volume of production allocated to or produced from the Federal lease
under the agreement terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Royalty Rate: Royalties must be paid in accordance with the royalty rate specified in each lease unless specified
otherwise under the terms of the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Value of Production: Value should be determined at the time of production. Value should be based on the fair market
value at the lease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payment Responsibility: Federal lessees or their working interest owners are ultimately responsible for paying
royalties, but other entities can be assigned the royalty payment responsibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee and Its Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the winter and spring of 1994, MMS met with representatives of the oil and gas industry and States to receive
input about the current gas market and identify regulatory changes needed to add certainty and simplicity to valuation,
for royalty purposes, of gas produced from Federal leases in a new gas market. An informal study group format was used
to obtain and clarify varying viewpoints. The materials received to date during the input sessions are available
for inspection and copying at the address referenced above for Ms. Deborah Gibbs Tschudy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the study group include representatives of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the Council of Petroleum
Accountants Societies (COPAS), the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association (RMOGA), the Independent Petroleum Association
of America (IPAA), the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), the Natural Gas Supply Association
(NGSA), an independent marketer, and representatives of the States of Utah, North Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico.
The MMS and the study group participants believe that the input sessions have been mutually beneficial. As a result,
MMS now believes it would be appropriate for the study group to transform itself and make specific regulatory recommendations
for implementing a rulemaking regarding Federal gas valuation. The Department is therefore establishing the Federal
Gas Valuation Negotiated Rulemaking Committee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recently enacted Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;648) contemplates a ``convening'' process
which involves identifying the potential parties and issues, publishing a notice of intent to form a committee, waiting
30 days for comments to be submitted responding to the notice, and only then proceeding with the establishment of the
committee provided it meets the criteria of the Act. In this case, the study group process has served the same function
as the convening_parties that would be significantly affected and the issues in controversy have been identified.
The study group's discussions have also enabled the MMS to determine that the criteria for negotiated rules, as spelled
out in the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, are met for this rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The rule is needed, since royalty payors are not able to comply with the current regulations particularly in
the current gas market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A limited number of identifiable interests will be significantly affected by the rule. Those parties are oil
and gas companies who produce gas and pay royalties on Federal leases and States who receive royalties from gas produced
from Federal leases located in their State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Representatives can be selected to adequately represent these interests, as reflected above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The interests are willing to negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach a consensus on a proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There is a reasonable likelihood that the Committee will reach consensus on a proposed rule within a reasonable
time. This determination has been made based on discussions of the study group, and hence is built on the developments
to date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The use of the negotiation will not delay the development of the rule if time limits are placed on the negotiation.
Indeed, its use will expedite both development and ultimate acceptance of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not proposing to issue a separate notice of intent to form a negotiated rulemaking committee for
this rule. Given the evolution of this committee, the publication of such a notice would only show down the rulemaking
process and the functions of the notice of intent have either already been met or are provided for in this notice. Moreover,
the Negotiated Rulemaking Act specifically provides that its provisions are not mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Negotiated Rulemaking Act does anticipate an outreach to ensure that people who were not contacted during the
convening process can come forward to explain why they believe they would be significantly affected and yet are not
represented on the Committee or to argue why they believe the rule should not be negotiated. The MMS believes that the
interests who would be significantly affected by this rule are represented by the informal study group already in
place which includes representatives from API, COPAS, RMOGA, IPAA, IPAMS, NGSA, an independent marketer, and the
states of Utah, Montana, North Dakota, and New Mexico. If anyone believes that their interests are not adequately
represented by these organizations, they must demonstrate and document that assertion through an application submitted
no later than 10 calendar days following publication of this notice. You may fax your documentation to (303) 275&hyph;7227.

Summary of Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In this notice, the Commission invites further comments on its proposal to reexamine and revise the criteria used
to select among applicants for new broadcast facilities, set forth in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reexamination of the Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 57 FR 14683 (Apr. 22, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Numerous commenters, who responded to the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking, stated their views as to
(1) Whether the existing comparative criteria should be modified or eliminated; (2) whether the new criteria should
be adopted; and (3) whether the Commission should adopt a point system with a tie-breaker to decide comparative cases.
These comments are currently under consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. During this consideration, on December 17, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit issued a ruling that the integration criterion was arbitrary and capricious and therefore invalid. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bechtel
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 10 F. 3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In light of the court's decision, the Commission must eliminate integration as a criterion
in the comparative evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Commission believes that this proceeding provides an appropriate means of reassessing the comparative standards
in light of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bechgtel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission finds it desirable, in resolving this proceeding, to have comments specifically addressing the impact
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bechtel
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on the relevant issues for pending and future cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In particular, the Commission seeks comments on: (1) The nature of the criteria that should be employed in light
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bechtel
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the weight different factors should be given; (2) the procedural ramifications of applying a revised comparative
analysis to pending cases; and (3) how any proposed revision of the comparative criteria could be structured to satisfy
the kind of concerns expressed in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bechtel.

threats to the survival of this species are habitat degradation and predation by domestic and feral mammals, fire,
and competition with alien plants. The small population size of one individual with its limited gene pool also comprises
a serious threat to this species. This proposal, if made final, would implement the Federal protection and recovery
provisions provided by the Act.

 of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) is a palm-like tree with unbranched woody stems 2 to 10 meters (m) (6 to 30
feet (ft)) tall. The leaves are long and narrow or elliptic with long petioles and undulate or flat, toothed margins,
about 5 to 21 centimeters (cm) (2 to 8 inches (in)) long and 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) wide. The flowering stalk bears 5 to 20 greenish-white,
slightly down-curved flowers 1.6 to 2.5 cm (0.6 to 1.0 in) long with one or two small knobs on the upper surfaces. The
fruits are ovoid to globose purple berries 0.6 to 1.2 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in) long. The three subspecies of

Previous Federal Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal action on this species began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered,
threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January
9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (40 FR 27823) accepting the report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of
the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. In this and subsequent
notices,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, endangered pursuant to section 4 of the Act. In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years
old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service
published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (44 FR 70796) of the withdrawal of that portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with
four other proposals that had expired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service published an updated Notice of Review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a category 1 candidate, meaning that the Service had substantial information indicating that a listing proposal
was appropriate. In the updated Notice of Review for plants on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990
(55 FR 6183), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was included as a Category 1* candidate, meaning that the Service had substantial information indicating that this
taxon was vulnerable in the recent past but may already have become extinct. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the 1982 amendments
to the Act, requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt.
Section 2(b)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. The latter was the case for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the Service had accepted the 1975 Smithsonian report as a petition. On October 13, 1983, the Service found
that the listing of the species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section
4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding
requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October
of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. Publication of the present proposal constitutes the final
1-year finding.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set
forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened
species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to

The habitat of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delissea undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including deliberate and
accidental alien mammal and plant introductions and agricultural development. Natural disturbances such as the
collapse of lava tubes also destroy habitat and can have a significant effect on small populations of plants. Competition
with alien plants as well as destruction of individuals and modification of habitat by introduced animals are the
primary threats facing this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning with Captain James Cook in 1792, early European explorers introduced livestock, which became feral, increased
in number and range, and caused significant changes to the natural environment of Hawaii. The 1848 provision for land
sales to individuals allowed large-scale agricultural and ranching ventures to begin. Land was cleared for these
enterprises to such a great extent that climatic conditions began to change and the amount and distribution of rainfall
were altered (Wenkam 1969). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past and present impacts of introduced alien animals are the primary factor in altering and degrading vegetation
and habitats on the island of Hawaii as well as on Kauai and Maui, where populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 previously existed. Feral ungulates trample and eat native vegetation and disturb open areas. This causes erosion
and allows the invasion of alien plant species (Cuddihy and Stone, 1990, Wagner 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 1990). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delissea undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is threatened by habitat degradation resulting from introduced ungulates (e.g., cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs).
Habitat degradation by these ungulates threatens the only known individual plant, any potential natural germination
of seedlings, as well as potential suitable habitat occurring throughout the historic range of the species.

Cattle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bos taurus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), native to Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern Asia, were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1793. Large
feral herds developed as a result of restrictions on killing cattle decreed by King Kamehameha I. Large ranches in
the tens of thousands of acres were created on Maui and Hawaii. Much of the land used in these private enterprises was
leased from the State or was privately owned. Feral cattle formerly existed on Maui and damaged the forests there.
Feral cattle are presently found on the island of Hawaii, and ranching is still a major commercial activity there.
Cattle eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, create disturbed areas into which alien
plants invade, and spread seeds of alien plants in their feces and on their bodies. The forest becomes degraded to grassland
pasture in areas grazed by cattle, and plant cover is reduced for many years following removal of cattle from an area.
Several alien grasses and legumes purposely introduced for cattle forage have become noxious weeds (Cuddihy and
Stone 1990, Tomich 1986). Cattle have altered and degraded the vegetation of much of Hawaii, including the areas where

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Goats (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Capra hircus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), native to the Middle East and India, were successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792, and currently
there are populations on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. On Kauai, feral goats have been present in drier,
more rugged areas since 1820; they still occur in Waimea Canyon. On Hawaii, goats damage low elevation dry forest,
montane parkland, subalpine woodlands, and alpine grasslands. Goats are managed in Hawaii as a game animal, but many
herds populate inaccessible areas where hunting has little effect on their numbers. Goat hunting is allowed year-round
or during certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR n.d., 1985). Goats browse on introduced grasses and native
plants, especially in drier and more open ecosystems. They also trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote

Pigs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sus scrofa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are originally native to Europe, northern Africa, Asia Minor, and Asia. European pigs, introduced to Hawaii by Captain
James Cook in 1778, became feral and invaded forested areas, especially wet and mesic forests and dry areas at high
elevations. They currently are present on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii and inhabit rain forests and grasslands.
Pig hunting is allowed on all islands either year-round or during certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR
n.d., 1985). While rooting in the ground in search of the invertebrates and plant material they eat, feral pigs disturb
and destroy vegetative cover, trample plants and seedlings, and threaten forest regeneration by damaging seeds
and seedlings. They disturb soil substrates and cause erosion, especially on slopes. Alien plant seeds are dispersed
in their hooves and coats as well as through their digestive tracts, and the disturbed soil is fertilized by their feces,
helping these plants to establish (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985, Stone 1985, Tomich 1986, Wagner

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cattle, goats, pigs, and sheep have been reported in the area where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delissea undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is known to occur. As this taxon is not known to be unpalatable to these ungulates, predation is a probable threat where
these animals have been reported. The lack of seedlings and the occurrence of the only known individual in an area less
accessible to ungulates seem to indicate the effect that browsing mammals, especially cattle, have had in restricting
the distribution of this plant. Though not legally obligated to protect the species, the State fenced the one individual
to protect it from further damage by ungulates (J. Giffin, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

, 1993). See Factor D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the four species of rodents which have been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, the species with the greatest impact
on the native flora and fauna is probably the roof or black rat (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rattus rattus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which now occurs on all the main Hawaiian Islands around human habitations, in cultivated fields, and in dry to wet
forests. Roof rats, and to a lesser extent house mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mus musculus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), Polynesian rat (

R. exulans

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
R. norvegicus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) eat the fruits of some native plants, especially those with large, fleshy fruits. Many native Hawaiian plants produce
their fruit over an extended period of time, and this produces a prolonged food supply which supports rodent populations.
It is probable that rats damage the fleshy fruit of

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only known population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delissea undulata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occurs on State land. The species is not presently listed as an endangered species by the State of Hawaii. Therefore
no State regulatory protection is in effect for this species. State laws relating to the conservation of biological
resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning
the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)). Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states,
``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant
to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''
(HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). Federal listing would automatically invoke listing under Hawaii State law, which
prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4).
The State also may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation,
management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)). If listing were to occur,
funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation district lands (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4) are regarded, among other purposes, as necessary for the protection
of endemic biological resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Requests
for amendments to district boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies
and private landowners (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4). The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources is mandated
to initiate changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare native species of flora
and fauna within the conservation district'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5.1). Hawaii environmental policy, and thus
approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;the State's unique natural environmental
characteristics .&blank;.&blank;.'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``protect endangered
species of individual plants and animals&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;4(3)(A)). Federal
listing, because it automatically invokes State listing, would also trigger these other State regulations protecting

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Federal listing as endangered would offer additional protection to this species since it would be a violation of the
Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction
in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy the only known extant individual. This
constitutes a major threat to

D. undulata.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural changes to habitat and substrate can result in the death of individual plants as well as the destruction of
their habitat. This especially affects the continued existence of taxa or populations with limited numbers and/or
narrow ranges and is often exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices (See Factor A). Additional collapse

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The historic native flora of Hawaii consisted of about 1,000 species, 89 percent of which were endemic. Of the total
native and naturalized Hawaiian flora of 1,817 species, 47 percent were introduced from other parts of the world and
nearly 100 species have become pests (Smith 1985, Wagner

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). Naturalized, introduced species degrade the Hawaiian landscape and compete with native plants for space,
light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Some of these species were brought to Hawaii by various groups
of people, including the Polynesian immigrants, for food or cultural reasons. Plantation owners, alarmed at the
reduction of water resources for their crops caused by the destruction of native forest cover by grazing feral animals,
supported the introduction of alien tree species for reforestation. Ranchers intentionally introduced pasture
grasses and other species for agriculture, and sometimes inadvertently introduced weed seeds as well. Other plants
were brought to Hawaii for their potential horticultural value (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wenkam 1969).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Passiflora mollissima

 (banana poka), a woody vine, poses a serious problem to mesic forests on Kauai and Hawaii by covering trees, reducing
the amount of light that reaches trees as well as understory, and causing damage and death to trees by the weight of the
vines. Animals, especially feral pigs, eat the fruit and distribute the seeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Escobar 1990).

Pennisetum clandestinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Kikuyu grass), an aggressive, fire adapted, perennial grass introduced to Hawaii as a pasture grass, withstands
trampling and grazing and has naturalized on four Hawaiian Islands in dry to mesic forest. It produces thick mats which
choke out other plants and prevent their seedlings from becoming established. It has been declared a noxious weed
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (7 CFR 360) (O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). Because Hawaiian plants were subjected
to fire during their evolution only in areas of volcanic activity and from occasional lightning strikes, they are
not adapted to recurring fire regimes and are unable to recover well following a fire. Fires may result from natural
causes, or they may be accidentally or purposely set by people. Vegetation on the slopes of Hualalai is particularly
vulnerable to fire due to the extensive invasion of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. clandestinum.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alien plants are often better adapted to fire than native plant species, and some fire-adapted grasses have become
widespread in Hawaii. Native shrubland can thus be converted to land dominated by alien grasses. The presence of such
species in Hawaiian ecosystems greatly increases the intensity, extent, and frequency of fire, especially during
drier months or drought. Fire-adapted alien species can reestablish in a burned area, resulting in a reduction in
the amount of native vegetation after each fire. Fire can destroy dormant seeds as well as mature plants and seedlings,
even in steep or inaccessible areas. The only known individual of

feral ungulates and alien plants, fire, and lack of legal protection. Small population size makes this species particularly
vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events. Because this species is in danger
of extinction throughout all of its range, it fits the definition of endangered as defined in the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently prudent for this species. Such a determination would result in no known benefit

Delissea undulata. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The extant population is on State land; State government agencies can be alerted to the presence of the plant without
the publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps. The publication of such descriptions and maps would potentially
increase the degree of threats from taking or vandalism because a live specimen of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of the importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of the species' habitat will be addressed through
the recovery process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known habitat of this species. Therefore,
the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of this species.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies,
private organizations, and individuals. Harold L. Lyon Arboretum of the University of Hawaii at Manoa is propagating
seeds collected from the one remaining individual as part of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex situ 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
conservation program. The Arboretum has over 300 seedlings growing as part of this conservation program, and has
sent approximately 20 individuals to the State's Hawaii forestry district for experimental outplanting in the Puu
Waawaa area (Charles H. Lamoureux, Harold L. Lyon Arboretum at University of Hawaii and J. Giffin, pers. comms.).
The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions
be carried out for all listed species. Since 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delissea undulata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is known to occur on State land, cooperation between Federal and State agencies is necessary to provide for its conservation.
The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants
are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that
is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. No Federal involvement is known
or anticipated that would affect 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as the only known site is on State owned land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all
endangered plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. undulata. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import
or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale
in interstate or foreign commerce, remove and reduce to possession an endangered plant species from areas under Federal
jurisdiction, maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction, or remove,
cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation
or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry
out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plants under certain circumstances. Such permits are
available for scientific purposes and to enhance the propagation and survival of the species. It is anticipated that
few trade permits would ever be sought or issued because the species is uncommon in cultivation and is very rare in the
wild.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this
determination was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to revoke the Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity
at 40 CFR 799.5050, promulgated under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), at 58 FR 40262, July
27, 1993. On October 8, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and the manufacturers and processors
of these substances filed suit seeking review of the rule in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The manufacturers of
7 of the 10 chemicals subject to the final test rule have agreed, subject to certain conditions set forth in the settlement
agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct a set of neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing under enforceable consent agreements
(``ECA''). If ECA negotiations are successful, EPA believes that the previously issued final test rule would no longer
be needed. EPA believes that, under a negotiated ECA, neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing would be conducted
and results made publicly available more quickly, and EPA resources used more effectively, than if EPA continued
to litigate the merits of the final test rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final test rule was published on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262), and requires manufacturers and processors of 10 substances
to conduct testing for neurotoxicity. It is anticipated that the following seven substances would be tested pursuant
to ECAs: acetone (CAS No. 67&hyph;64&hyph;1), technical grade 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
amyl acetate (CAS No. 628&hyph;63&hyph;7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
butyl acetate (CAS No. 123&hyph;86&hyph;4), ethyl acetate (CAS No. 141&hyph;78&hyph;6), isobutyl alcohol (CAS
No. 78&hyph;83&hyph;1), methyl isobutyl ketone (CAS No. 108&hyph;10&hyph;1), and tetrahydrofuran (CAS No. 109&hyph;99&hyph;9).
Testing is currently underway for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol. Pharmacokinetics testing would be conducted on butyl acetate to determine if
its test results for neurotoxicity can be used to assess the neurotoxicity of its metabolite, 1-butanol. EPA does
not anticipate entering into an ECA for 1-butanol (CAS No. 71&hyph;36&hyph;3), diethyl ether (CAS No. 60&hyph;29&hyph;7),
or 2-ethoxyethanol (CAS No. 110&hyph;80&hyph;5), three other substances for which testing is required under the
final test rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262) EPA issued a test rule under TSCA section 4 that required manufacturers and processors
of ten substances to conduct testing for neurotoxicity (Ref. 1). The required testing was the same for all 10 substances
and included acute and subchronic functional observational battery and motor activity, and subchronic neuropathology
and schedule-controlled operant behavior. These 10 substances are listed below:

The manufacturers of these substances petitioned for review of the final rule under TSCA section 19 in the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals (Ref. 2). Subsequent to the filing of this challenge to the rule, EPA, the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (``CMA''), and authorized representatives of all parties challenging the rule, entered into settlement
negotiations to resolve the lawsuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these settlement discussions, CMA and the other parties to the lawsuit have agreed, subject to certain
conditions set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing
of seven chemical substances under negotiated ECAs, to be implemented by an order issued by EPA under TSCA section
4. Testing on two of the chemicals subject to the final rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol, is already underway. It is CMA's stated intent that such testing continue on schedule
during the pendency of this proceeding (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In turn, EPA has agreed to propose to withdraw the final test rule. EPA is aware that the settlement agreement contemplates
a reduced set of testing on fewer chemicals than the testing regimen required by the final rule. Although EPA believes
that the rulemaking record contains substantial evidence to support the testing requirements in the final rule,
EPA has decided not to proceed with the litigation at this time. EPA believes that the uncertain outcome of the court's
decision is outweighed by the benefits of allowing testing to proceed immediately. EPA believes that the settlement
agreement is in the public interest as it will allow testing to proceed on an expedited basis, without the uncertainties
of protracted litigation. EPA notes that although CMA's lawsuit has been dismissed without prejudice by the 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals, in response to a joint motion for a stay, it can be reinstated by either party upon filing of a letter
with the court (Ref. 21). This Notice will allow all interested parties an opportunity to evaluate and comment on EPA's
proposed revocation of the final rule and decision to pursue an ECA as the mechanism for achieving testing.

In the above tests, the test substance is to be administered to rats by the inhalation route of exposure in either a single
exposure (acute) or repeated exposures over a 90&hyph;day period (subchronic). In both acute and subchronic studies,
the test substance is to be administered to several groups of experimental animals, one exposure concentration being
used per group. The animals are then to be observed under carefully standardized conditions with sufficient frequency
to ensure the detection of behavioral and/or neurologic abnormalities over the range of exposures and also to determine
the exposure level which results in no neurotoxic effect, i.e. no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). The non-invasive
functional observational battery is designed to detect gross functional deficits in young adult animals resulting
from exposure to the administered chemical. The non-invasive motor activity test is designed to examine changes
in the level and pattern of the animals' physical movement. These deficits and changes are also to be evaluated in the
context of changes in other organ systems. The test for neuropathology is designed to detect and characterize morphologic
changes in the tissue of the nervous system. The nervous system tissues are to be examined grossly and microscopically,
beginning with tissues from animals in the highest dose group and proceeding to lower dose groups until a no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) is determined. The non-invasive schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB) test
is intended to evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to a chemical on performance of a learned behavior by measuring
the rate and pattern of responding in relationship to the schedule of reinforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991 EPA updated its guidelines for neurotoxicity testing. The 1991 guidelines incorporate the functional observational
battery, motor activity, and neuropathology into a single guideline entitled ``Neurotoxicity Screening Battery.''
The SCOB test guideline remains a separate guideline. The 1991 guidelines evaluate the same endpoints as the older
guidelines and also provide for greater flexibility in the conduct of the testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In September 1993, CMA requested, on behalf of its member companies subject to the testing requirements of the final
rule, that EPA permit testing to be conducted according to the 1991 guidelines instead of the guidelines specified
in the final test rule (Ref. 4). EPA agreed to this modification (Ref. 5). CMA also requested modifications of the test
guidelines (Refs. 10, 14, 18 and 20) and modifications of the deadlines for submitting the test results (Refs. 10,
12, and 15). EPA granted most of these requests (Refs. 11, 13, 16, 17, and 19). The settlement agreement contemplates
the retention of all modifications to the final rule's testing requirements in the anticipated ECAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Compared with the final rule, the above testing program represents a retention of the full set of tests for three chemicals
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate), a reduction in tests for four chemicals (acetone,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
amyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, and tetrahydrofuran), and an elimination of testing for three chemicals (1-butanol,
diethyl ether, and 2-ethoxyethanol). It is anticipated, however, that the pharmacokinetics/metabolism test of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
butyl acetate may indicate that the separate testing of 1-butanol may not be necessary, and because of this 1-butanol
manufacturers have agreed to share in the cost of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
butyl acetate testing. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate of butyl acetate will be performed
in a study of its in vivo hydrolysis to 1-butanol. If the conversion of butyl acetate to 1-butanol is sufficiently rapid
and complete, EPA may determine that the neurotoxic effects of 1-butanol can be predicted from the results of butyl
acetate testing. If this is not the case, EPA may consider reproposing separate testing of 1-butanol.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticipated testing programs for acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) include only the SCOB; the neurotoxicity
screening battery for these two substances would be eliminated. EPA agreed to this change for the following reasons:
The body of available toxicity data on both chemicals is considerable, and the available studies, which might, at
some level, have shown the types of functional and morphologic effects which would be detected by the screening battery,
do not indicate such effects. Furthermore, the SCOB test, as a test of performance dependent on learning and memory,
evaluates a very different endpoint than those evaluated by the available toxicity studies. The SCOB may detect effects
not seen in existing studies and represents a greater data gap for these chemicals. In the case of acetone, there is
an additional reason for retaining the subchronic SCOB in the testing program. The acute SCOB test of acetone by Glowa
and Dews was positive (Ref. 6), and EPA believes this positive finding bears further investigation in a repeated-dose
test. For these reasons, EPA believes that this testing would represent a reasonable compromise which could avoid
protracted litigation while still developing relevant data necessary to determine the neurotoxicity of these two
chemical substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MIBK is currently listed as a hazardous air pollutant (HAP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is considering initiating
a TSCA section 4 testing program for several CAA HAPs, including MIBK. If neurotoxicity testing of MIBK is proposed
under this HAPs testing effort, EPA believes that a delay of MIBK testing under the anticipated ECA would be warranted.
The delay, which would remain in effect pending the promulgation of the future HAPs test rule, would allow EPA and the
MIBK test sponsors to coordinate testing efforts under the consent order and the future test rule to achieve the most
efficient use of testing resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both MIBK and acetone, EPA reserves the right to initiate future rulemaking or consent agreements if data from
the SCOB tests, other section 4 test programs, or any additional new information indicate the need for such a step.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
amyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran would include only the neurotoxicity screening battery; the SCOB tests would be
eliminated. Given the limited nature of neurotoxicity testing on these chemicals, EPA believes that, at this time,
the screening battery tests alone would represent an appropriate set of tests on these chemicals. Another factor
influencing EPA's decision is that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
amyl acetate had the lowest production volume and lowest estimated exposure of all 10 substances in the final test
rule. For these reasons, EPA believes that this testing would represent a reasonable compromise which could avoid
protracted litigation while still developing relevant data necessary to determine the neurotoxicity of these two
chemical substances. EPA, however, reserves the right to initiate future rulemaking or consent agreements if new
information or the data developed from the screening battery tests of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
amyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran indicate a need for such a step.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to propose to revoke all testing requirements for diethyl ether and 2-ethoxyethanol (2-EE) is primarily
based on the estimated potential exposure to these substances. Diethyl ether has the second lowest production volume
of the 10 substances in the test rule, which should directly influence potential exposure. A second consideration
was that the available toxicity data on diethyl ether includes several human studies and more behavioral studies
than were available on the other 9 substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of 2-ethoxyethanol, EPA anticipates a reduction in the potential exposure estimated by the proposed and
final rules. The environmental release of 2-ethoxyethanol has been confirmed to be on the decline by Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI) data recently made available for the years 1990, 1991, and 1992 (Ref. 9). It is the only substance in
the final test rule for which current information indicates that there is no consumer exposure, i.e. the producers
of 2-EE who are parties to the settlement agreement have represented to EPA that there are no current consumer uses
of the chemical (Ref. 3). To monitor the possible reemergence of any consumer uses of 2-ethoxyethanol, in the near
future EPA intends to propose and promulgate a Significant New Use Rule (``SNUR'') under TSCA section 5(a)(2) to require
notification to EPA 90 days prior to the manufacture, import, or processing of 2-EE for use in a consumer product. The
parties to the agreement have agreed not to oppose such a rule (Ref. 3). Concerning occupational exposure to 2-ethoxyethanol,
EPA believes that if the recently proposed OSHA health standard for 2-ethoxyethanol (58 FR 15526, March 23, 1993)
becomes effective it should reduce the likelihood of occupational exposure (Ref. 7). OSHA's regulatory agenda schedules
this health standard to be finalized as soon as April 1995 (Ref. 8). Should the implementation of the OSHA health standard
be significantly delayed because of a legal challenge or if the consumer use of 2-ethoxyethanol reemerges, EPA may
feel compelled to reconsider proposing testing at that time. As stated earlier, EPA reserves the right to initiate
future rulemaking or consent agreements on these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances if it appears warranted at that time.

III. Proposed Revocation of Final Test Rule and Issues for Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the reasons stated above, EPA is proposing to revoke the final Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity
(40 CFR 799.5050). The decision to allow manufacturers of these substances to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics
testing under ECAs should allow for the most timely development and public availability of data to assess the potential
neurotoxicity of these compounds. While EPA acknowledges that the testing that may be conducted under ECAs may not
be as extensive as that required by the final test rule, EPA believes that use of the ECA process will result in the fastest
development of data. Testing and data development will proceed without the potentially lengthy delay of testing
pending resolution of costly litigation on the merits of the final test rule.

A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'');
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this
Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this order, EPA has determined that this rule would not be ``significant.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA is certifying that revocation of this test rule would
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses because only the 28 manufacturers who sign
the anticipated ECAs will be responsible for conducting and paying for the testing. None of these manufacturers are
small businesses.

On May 18, 1994, the U.S. Department of Agriculture receive a complaint alleging price undercutting of domestic Swiss
cheese in the United States by imported subsidized quota Swiss cheese produced in Austria, Denmark, and Germany.
Under section 702 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;39), the Secretary of Agriculture must conduct
an investigation and make a determination as to the validity of the allegations no later than 30 days after receiving
a complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the investigation of the Director of the Dairy, Livestock and Poultry Division, Foreign Agricultural Service,
conducted pursuant to the regulations at 7 CFR 6.40&hyph;.44, I have determined that the duty-paid wholesale price
during the period December 1993 through April 1994 in the New York-New Jersey market area was $1.55 per pound, $1.56
per pound, and $1.12 per pound for Swiss cheese blocks imported from Austria, Denmark, and Germany, respectively.
I have also determined that during the same period in the same market area, the duty-paid wholesale price was $1.80
per pound and $1.69 per pound for cuts, slices, loaves, etc., of Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and Germany, respectively.
During the same period in the same market area, I have determined that the price for Swiss cheese trims and end pieces
imported from Austria was $1.37 per pound. In addition, I have determined that the domestic wholesale market price
during the period December 1993 through April 1994 for U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the New York-New Jersey market
area was $1.76 for blocks, $1.85 cuts, slices, loaves, etc., and $1.54 for trims and end pieces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Department of Commerce, has determined that
the average daily export restitution payment provided by the European Union during the investigation period was
$0.74 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and $0.73 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Germany.
In the case of subsidies provided by the Government of Austria export restitution payments ranged from $1.847 per
pound to $2.261 per pound during the investigation period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I have, therefore, determined that price undercutting of U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the United States by imported
subsidized quota Swiss cheese from Austria, Denmark, and Germany is taking place, and I have notified the United States
Trade Representative accordingly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 31, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corporation (``Shieldalloy'').
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from the
Russian Federation are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning
of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and that such imports are materially injuring, or
threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because it is a domestic industry producing the produce
subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section
771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification
with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are imports of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium, regardless of grade,
chemistry, form, shape, or size, unless expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Ferrovanadium
includes alloys containing vanadium as the predominant element, by weight (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
more weight than any other element, except iron in some instances), and at least 4 percent, by weight, of iron. Nitrided
vanadium includes alloys containing vanadium as the predominant element, by weight, and at least 5 percent, by weight,
of nitrogen. Excluded from the scope of this investigation are vanadium additives other than ferrovanadium and nitrided
vanadium, such as vanadium-aluminum master alloys, vanadium chemicals, vanadium waste and scrap, vanadium-bearing
raw materials such as slag, boiler residues, and fly ash, and vanadium oxides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The products subject to this investigation are classifiable under subheadings 7202.92.00 and 2850.00.20 of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner contends that the foreign market value (FMV) of Russian-produced imports subject to this investigation
must be determined in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns non-market economy (NME) countries.
The Russian Federation is presumed to be an NME within the meaning of section 771(18)(C) of the Act, because the Department
has treated it as such in previous investigations (

58 FR 29192 (May 19, 1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, foreign market value (FMV) in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors
of production, as valued in a market economy country. Absent evidence that a particular NME country government determines
which of its factories shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation,
to base FMV only on those factories that produced ferrovanadium and/or nitrided vanadium sold to the United States
during the period of investigation (POI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide
relevant information and argument on this issue. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation
to submit comments on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the respective NME.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of the factors of production. The factors of production used
by petitioner were based on experience at a German factory, related to the petitioner, which uses a production process
similar to that used in Russia. Petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of raw materials: labor, energy, utilities,
overhead, general expenses, profit and packing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value the factors of production, petitioner, citing an August 11, 1992, memorandum from the Import Administration
Office of Policy to David L. Binder with regard to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ferrosilicon from Russia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
used Brazil as the surrogate country and relied on information obtained by a related party in Brazil. Where it could
not obtain Brazilian data, petitioner used information on South Africa, as South Africa was also mentioned as a possible
surrogate for Russia in the August 11, 1992, memorandum. Petitioner relied on the Brazilian related party's labor
rate data instead of publicly available, published information because it contended that the public data were obsolete
and/or less accurate. Because the Department has a clear preference for the use of publicly available, published
information, and petitioner did not demonstrate conclusively that its reported labor rates were superior to the
publicly available information, we have recalculated FMV using the labor rate submitted in the petition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pure and Alloy Magnesium from the Russian Federation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 31, 1994, we received a petition in proper form filed by QO Chemicals, Inc. (petitioner), the sole U.S. producer
of furfuryl alcohol. Petitioner filed supplements to the petition on June 6, 15, 16, and 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of furfuryl alcohol from the People's Republic
of China (PRC), Thailand, and the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the
United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act),
and that such imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section
771(9)(C) of the Act, and it is the sole domestic producer of furfuryl alcohol. If any interested party, as described
under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to,
this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.

Petitioner based United States Price (USP) on FOB PRC port, C&amp;F U.S. port, and CIF U.S. port, price quotes from
PRC producers through their representative U.S. trading companies. Adjustments were made for foreign inland freight,
ocean freight, and marine insurance. Petitioner based inland freight on the distance from the PRC producers of the
subject merchandise to the PRC port of export. Freight transportation charges were valued using Indian surrogate
data. (

 description of non-market economy (NME) below methodology). Ocean freight and marine insurance charges were estimated
by comparing per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 customs value import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 customs value
import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 CIF import statistics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner asserts that the PRC is a NME within the meaning of sections 771(18)(A) and (C) of the Act and in accordance
with section 773(c) of the Act. Accordingly, foreign market value (FMV) should be based on the producer's factors
of production, valued in a surrogate market economy country. The Department has determined in previous investigations
that the PRC is a NME, and the presumption of NME status continues for the initiation of this investigation.

Absent evidence that a particular NME country government determines which of its factories shall produce for export

Petitioners based the factors of production on the production process used by PRC producers of the subject merchandise
and valued these factors, where possible, on publicly available published information from the surrogate country,
India. Where certain values were not available from Indian sources, petitioner has used values from Pakistan and
Indonesia. These countries have been determined to be appropriate surrogates for the PRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A&hyph;570&hyph;826. For purposes of these initiations, we have accepted, pursuant to section 773 (c)(4) of the
Act, petitioner's view that India, Pakistan, and Indonesia are appropriate surrogate countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 773(c)(1) of the Act, petitioner determined FMV on the basis of the value of factors of production
specified in section 773(c)(3) of the Act. These factors included materials, energy, labor costs and a percentage
for factory overhead based on information from India. Petitioner then added the statutory minimum of ten percent
for general expenses and eight percent for profit, as well as an amount for packing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disregarded certain factor values where the inputs were based on prices in the United States because (1) petitioner
failed to follow the Department's established hierarchy regarding selection of surrogate countries for the PRC,
with respect to factor valuation, and (2) petitioner provided no basis for determining that United States values
are representative of the appropriate surrogate country values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the recalculated dumping margins ranged from 225.42 percent to 320.69 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based USP for South Africa on IM&hyph;145 data. Petitioner adjusted for foreign inland freight, ocean
freight and marine insurance charges. Ocean freight and marine insurance charges were estimated by comparing per-unit

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner based FMV on a domestic price quote from a producer of the subject merchandise in South Africa to a home market
customer. An adjustment was made for foreign inland freight to arrive at an ex-factory price. Petitioner then added
VAT to both the FMV and USP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margin alleged by petitioner is 68 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based USP for Thailand on U.S. IM&hyph;145 Customs data. Petitioner adjusted for foreign inland freight,
ocean freight and marine insurance charges. Petitioner calculated inland freight charges based on the distance
from the Thai producer's plant to the port of export. Ocean freight and marine insurance charges were estimated by
comparing per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 customs value import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM&hyph;145 CIF import statistics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner based FMV on constructed value (CV) because it claimed that the Thai market was not viable and that home
market and third country prices provided in the petition represented sales that were made below the cost of production
(COP) and therefore were not appropriate bases for calculating FMV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner provided a sales price from a Thai producer to a home market customer, and third country prices to Germany
and the Netherlands, based on 1993 Thai export statistics to these countries. We did not use the Thai sales price to
the home market customer because the source of the information could not be substantiated. Petitioner's claim that
the home market is not viable is moot because they have been unable to obtain a substantiated home market sales price
in Thailand. We rejected prices to third countries because these prices were found to be below COP, as described below.

Allegations of Home Market and Third Country Sales Below Cost of Production: Thailand
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner alleged that a Thai producer is selling the subject merchandise in the home market at prices below its COP.
This allegation is based on a comparison of a domestic price obtained in Thailand with the Thai producer's COP for the
subject merchandise. Because the domestic sales price from Thailand is unsubstantiated, there is no need to address
petitioner's home market COP allegation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Review of Estimated COP and Constructed Value for Furfuryl Alcohol Memorandum,'' dated June 17, 1994, which is
on file in the Central Records Unit, at the Department of Commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner also alleged that the Thai producer's sales prices to Germany and the Netherlands were also made at prices
below COP. This allegation is based on a comparison of the third country prices to Germany and to the Netherlands (based
on 1993 Thai export statistics to these countries) to the Thai producer's calculated COP. A comparison of prices to
Germany and the Netherlands to the Thai producer's COP for the subject merchandise indicates sales below cost. If
the Department determines after these initiations that the home market is not viable and the Department uses third
country prices in Germany or the Netherlands for purposes of comparison to USP, we will initiate separate cost investigations
at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for purposes of this initiation, in accordance with 773(e)(1) of the Act, we are accepting petitioner's
estimate of CV as the only appropriate basis for FMV. Petitioners based CV on costs incurred by a Thai producer, and
its own manufacturing experience adjusted for differences in costs between the United States and Thailand. An amount
for selling, general and administrative expenses and the statutory minimum for profit were added to the cost of manufacturer.
Petitioner added an amount for export packing to arrive a total CV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the recalculated dumping margin is 72.35 percent.

Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that imports to furfuryl alcohol from the PRC,
the Republic of South Africa, and Thailand are being, or likely to be, sold at less than fair value. If it becomes necessary
at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available, we may review the calculations used
to derive the allegations.

We have examined the petitions on furfuryl alcohol and have found that they meet the requirements of section 732(b)
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(a). Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether
imports of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC, the Republic of South Africa, and Thailand are being, or are likely to be,
sold in the United States at less than fair value. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our preliminary
determinations by November 7, 1994.

On June 1, 1994, in accordance with section 705(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1671d(a)(1)),
petitioner in the above-referenced investigations requested that we align the due date for the final countervailing
duty determinations with that of the final antidumping duty determinations for certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe
fittings from India and Israel. Accordingly, we are aligning these final determinations. Therefore, the final countervailing
duty determinations are due no later than October 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. International Trade Commission is being advised of this alignment, in accordance with section 705(d) of
the Act.

Decision: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approved. No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for such purposes as these instruments
are intended to be used, was being manufactured in the United States at the time the instruments were ordered. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each foreign instrument is a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM) and is intended for research
or scientific educational uses requiring a CTEM. We know of no CTEM, or any other instrument suited to these purposes,
which was being manufactured in the United States either at the time of order of each instrument or at the time of receipt
of application by the U.S. Customs Service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of the availability of the final evaluation findings for Alabama, California, Connecticut,
Mississippi, Maine, and New Hampshire Coastal Management Programs, and Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island), Rookery
Bay (Florida), Chesapeake Bay (Maryland), and North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR). Section
312 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), as amended, requires a continuing review of the performance
of coastal states with respect to coastal management and the operation and management of NERRs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The states of Alabama, California, Connecticut, Maine and New Hampshire were found to be implementing and enforcing
their Federally approved coastal management program, addressing the national coastal management objective identified
in CZMA section 303(2)(A)&hyph;(K), and adhering to the programmatic terms of their financial assistance awards.
The State of Mississippi was found not fully adhering to its approved coastal management program. Implementation
of several recommendations listed in the findings will bring Mississippi's program back into satisfactory adherence.
North Carolina, Narragansett Bay, Rookery Bay, and Chesapeake Bay, MD NERRs were found to be satisfactorily adhering
to programmatic requirement of the NERR system.

Public Law 101&hyph;510, November 5, 1990, authorized a land exchange between the City of Columbus, Georgia and the
Department of the Army (Fort Benning). In this agreement, the City receives approximately 3,125 acres of land from
Fort Benning, and in exchange, the City will convey to Fort Benning approximately 3,225 acres located on the southern
boundary of the military reservation, land currently owned by a third party, Mead Coated Board, Inc. The City intends
to use the land to expand its existing sanitary landfill, to develop tracts for economic development, and to provide
land for passive recreation. Fort Benning will use the land it receives to augment training areas in the southern part
of the military reservation.

is designed to process all the solid waste generated at Fort Lewis and McChord AFB in a manner that meets all applicable
regulatory requirements. There are four alternatives considered in this DEIS for managing solid waste.

Take notice that on June 15, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State) tendered for filing with the
Commission the original and revised tariff sheets listed below in its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1,
containing changes in rates and other tariff provisions for effectiveness on July 1, 1994:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to Granite State, its filing is a limited Section 4 filing to direct bill its former bundled sales customers,
Bay State Gas Company (Bay State) and Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities) for unreimbursed transportation
charges paid to upstream pipeline transporters prior to the effectiveness of its restructured operations on November
1, 1993. Granite State further states that, prior to restructuring, it had assembled a system supply of natural gas
to provide its sales services which included purchases of Canadian gas from Boundary Gas, Inc. (Boundary Gas) and
Shell Canada, Limited, (Shell). It is further stated that Granite State purchased these supplies at the U.S.-Canadian
border and arranged for transportation services on upstream transporters for the delivery of these supplies to its
market area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Granite State it was authorized to pass through the upstream transportation charges in a Transportation
Cost Adjustment added to its sales rates during the period prior to the commencement of its restructured operations.
The Transportation Cost Adjustment was approved by the Commission in Boundary Gas, Inc., et al., 26 FERC &para;61,114
(1984) and initially reflected only the transportation charges incurred under Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's
Rate Schedule CGT&hyph;NE for the transportation of Granite State's Boundary Gas purchases to its market area. Later,
according to Granite State, the transportation charges incurred for the delivery of its Shell purchases over the
combined facilities of Iroquois Gas Transmission System (Rate Schedule RTS&hyph;1), Tennessee (Rate Schedule
NET&hyph;NE) and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Rate Schedule AFT&hyph;2) were included in the derivation
of the Transportation Cost Adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Granite State, the Transportation Cost Adjustment was essentially a tracking mechanism; however,
revisions in the Adjustment often lagged changes in the upstream transporters rates. Granite State further states
that it has made a complete review of the transportation charges incurred under the upstream pipelines transportation
rate schedules compared with the reimbursement through the Transportation Cost Adjustment for the period from July,
1989, through October 31, 1993. According to Granite State, during this period it incurred $505,080 of unreimbursed
demand and commodity transportation charges which it proposes to direct bill to Bay State and Northern Utilities,
as shown on Original Sheet No. 35 in the instant filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Granite State further states that Third Revised Sheet No. 20, an Index, and Original Sheet Nos. 36&hyph;99, Reserved
Sheets, are included for the editorial revisions in the tariff necessitated by the addition of Original Sheet No.
35.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Granite State, copies of its filing were served upon its customers, Bay State and Northern Utilities,
and the regulatory commissions of the States of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a
motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on June 17, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No.

is set forth in Appendix A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that the purpose of the instant filing is to adjust TGPL's TBO unit rate in accordance with the commission's
order issued May 18, 1994 in Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;59&hyph;000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (May 18 Order). The May 18 Order directed TGPL to file within 30 days of the date of the May 18 Order revised rates based
on the inclusion of the contact demand of certain conversion shippers (i.e., incrementally priced Section 7(c) firm
transportation shippers who convert to Part 284 service) in the computation of TGPL's TBO unit rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that copies of the instant filing are being mailed to customers, State Commissions and other interested
parties. In accordance with the provisions of Section 154.16 of the Commission's Regulations, copies of this filing
are available for public inspection, during regular business hours, in a convenient form and place at TGPL's main

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protest should be filed on or before June
28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.

On November 15, 1991, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Washington (Region 43). On April 4, 1994,
Region 43 submitted a proposed amendment to its plan would reformat the Plan, add two yearly filing windows and further
clarify the application review procedures. Because the proposed amendment is a major change to the Region 43 plan,
the Commission is soliciting comments from the public before taking action. (See Report and Order, General Docket
No. 87&hyph;112, 3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before July 28, 1994 and reply comments on or before
August 12, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554 and should clearly identify them as submissions to PR Docket 91&hyph;270 Washingrton-Public
Safety Region 43.

BACKGROUND:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 15, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delegated to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (Board) its approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as per 5 CFR 1320.9, to approve of
and assign OMB control numbers to collection of information requests and requirements conducted or sponsored by
the Board under conditions set forth in 5 CFR 1320.9. Board-approved collections of information will be incorporated
into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information. A copy of the SF 83 and supporting
statement and the approved collection of information instrument(s) will be placed into OMB's public docket files.
The following forms, which are being handled under this delegated authority, have received initial Board approval
and are hereby published for comment. At the end of the comment period, the proposed information collection, along
with an analysis of comments and recommendations received, will be submitted to the Board for final approval under
OMB delegated authority.

necessary programming changes.

General description of report:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This information collection is voluntary [12 U.S.C. 248(a)(2), 353&hyph;359a, and 461] and is given confidential
treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This group of reports (the ``FR 2004 series'') is used to collect data on positions, transactions and financing activity
from U.S. government securities dealers. Data needs with respect to the FR 2004 series have changed in light of the
Joint Report on the Government Securities Market submitted to the Congress in January 1992 by the Federal Reserve,
the U.S. Treasury Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on that report, significant changes
to the FR 2004 series of reports have been recommended. A summary of those changes follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Weekly Report of Dealer Positions (FR 2004A): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Money market instruments and the addendum section are eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Pass-through mortgage-backed securities and all other mortgage-backed securities are combined into one
category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Federal agency securities are combined into one maturity category and two maturity categories of Treasury
securities are eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Option positions are reduced to long and short categories rather than purchased and sold calls, purchased
and sold puts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Forward positions are reported with immediate positions under the title ``outright positions''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Weekly Report of Cumulative Transactions (FR 2004B): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The addendum section is eliminated and the Treasury, agency and mortgage-backed categories are abbreviated
as on the proposed revised FR 2004A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Buys'' and ``Sells'' categories are combined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Primary Dealers are combined with ``customers'' (now called ``with others'') rather than brokers, and the
``all other'' category is eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Forward transactions are reported with immediate positions under the title ``outright transactions''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Weekly Report of Dealer Financing (FR 2004C): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Customer categories are eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Term agreements are reduced to one category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The categories ``cash collateral'' and ``securities and LC's'' are eliminated and replaced by securities
received as pledge or pledged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fails are condensed on the proposed report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Daily Report of Dealer Positions in Treasury Financings (FR 2004WI): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Gross long and short positions are replaced by purchases and sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Net financing commitments are added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the new Report of Specific Issues (FR 2004SI): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This is an entirely new report that is similar to the addendum sections of the current FR 2004A and B, except that
it incorporates financing and fails. It is designed to collect information on specific Treasury securities for market
surveillance purposes. It will be collected weekly on a routine basis. Also, the Federal Reserve will have the authority
to call for reporting of any issue daily, on an as-needed basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Report of Suggested Evidence of Accuracy (FR 2004B.1): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Eliminated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) administers national programs for children, youth and
families, works with States and local communities to develop services which support and strengthen family life,
seeks out joint ventures with the private sector to enhance the lives of children and their families, and provides
information and other assistance to parents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The concerns of ACYF extend to all children from birth through adolescence. Many of the programs administered by the
agency focus on children from low-income families; children and youth in need of foster care, adoption or other child
welfare services; preschool children and preschool children with disabilities; abused and neglected children;
runaway and homeless youth; youth gangs; and children from American Indian, Alaskan Native, and migrant families.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACYF funds research, demonstration, dissemination, utilization and technical assistance in four basic areas:
child welfare, child care, youth development, and child and family services. The resources budgeted for these four
areas address the needs and problems confronting some of the most vulnerable children and families in the country.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within ACYF, the Children's Bureau's Division of Child Welfare plans, manages, coordinates and supports child welfare
services programs. It administers the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program, the Child Welfare Services Program,
the Independent Living Program, the Child Welfare Research, Demonstration and Training Program, the Adoption Opportunities
Program, the Temporary Child Care and Crisis Nurseries Program, the Abandoned Infants Assistance Program and the
recently enacted Family Preservation and Family Support program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Children's Bureau's programs are designed to promote the welfare of all children, including those disabled,
homeless, dependent, abused or neglected children and their families. The programs aid in preventing and remedying
the neglect, abuse and exploitation of children. The programs also encourage the strengthening of the family unit
to help prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families, and reunify families, where possible,
when separation has occurred.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federally funded child welfare resource centers have been in existence for over a decade. In 1982 the Children's Bureau
supported ten Regional Child Welfare Resource Centers as well as several national specialized centers to operate
three year projects. In 1985 the Children's Bureau funded six National Resource Centers for a three year period to
provide leadership to the field through the identification, collection, development and utilization of models
and promising practices, systems improvements, training programs, and other resource materials on effective methods
of addressing child welfare service program needs. Each Resource Center focused on a priority area of child welfare
services: family-based services, foster care, adoption, youth services, legal resources, and management and administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These Centers were directed by the Federal government to move towards self-sufficiency. Although this criterion
of self-sufficiency was met, certain critical core functions which proved vital to the States_short-term consultation,
information dissemination, and the development of programs, practices, and resource materials on emerging issues_could
not be provided without ongoing Federal support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988 and 1989 the six Resource Centers received continuation funding to insure the ongoing availability of these
core services. In 1990, the Children's Bureau employed a competitive process to again fund National Centers in the
same six priority areas to make sure resources in key areas would continue to be available to the field. In 1993, a National
Adoption Resource Center was funded for a five year project period.

This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to five years. Awards, on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be five years. Applications for continuation grants
funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period but within the five year project period will be entertained
in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to availability of funds, timely and successful completion
of the project, and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Children's Bureau plans to make this determination, in part, by convening a panel of experts, including customers,
to review the progress of the five National Resource Centers for Child Welfare Services Programs and the National
Resource Center for Programs Serving Abandoned Infants and Infants at Risk of Abandonment and Their Families during
the third budget period and to make recommendations regarding continued funding on a non-competitive basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successful completion of the review during the third budget period will result in the five National Resource Centers
for Child Welfare Services Programs being able to submit non-competitive applications for two additional budget
periods and the National Resource Center for Programs Serving Abandoned Infants and Infants at Risk of Abandonment
and Their Families being able to submit a non-competitive application for one additional budget period subject to
the availability of funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: This section specifies the minimum non-Federal contribution, either through cash or in-kind match, that is required.
Applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Grantees must provide at
least 10 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACYF
share and the non-Federal share. Therefore, if the required match is 10 percent, a project requesting $90,000 in Federal
funds must include a match of at least $10,000 (10 percent of the total project cost of $100,000).

3. Background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: A period of great promise and significant opportunity has emerged for child welfare. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 established a new Subpart 2 of Title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act, entitled Family Preservation
and Support Services, which is capable of stimulating meaningful change in child welfare systems and fostering more
effective working relationships among Federal, State and local governments, other direct service providers, foundations
and advocacy groups around child welfare matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal government is in the process of redefining its relationship with State and other child welfare agencies.
A new partnership is being forged based upon a vision wherein all concerned agencies will collaborate and cooperate
to provide a continuum of services to meet the needs of vulnerable children, youth and families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the capped entitlement funding to States from the Family Preservation and Support Program is relatively
modest, there is widespread agreement within the child and family policy community that the funds can be used best
in a creative and strategic fashion to stimulate and encourage broader system reform which is already underway in
many States and communities. Because the multiple needs of vulnerable children and families cannot be adequately
addressed through categorical programs and fragmented service delivery systems, States are being encouraged to
use the new funds to help establish a continuum of coordinated and integrated, culturally relevant, family-centered
services for children and families. Specifically, States are being asked to conduct a broad-based and inclusive
planning process with their FY 1994 Family Preservation and Family Support allocation leading to the development
of a five-year State Plan for child welfare, including family preservation and support services, beginning in FY
1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Federal child welfare initiatives are being implemented that have enormous potential for the field.
The publication of the final rule for the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), and interim
final rules for the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information Systems (SACWIS), in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 22, 1993, paves the way for the collection, aggregation and analysis of child welfare data to inform and
improve policies, programs, and practices at the Federal, State and local levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Private philanthropy continues to make a major investment in responding to the needs of the child welfare system.
Numerous foundations are underwriting the costs of major reform efforts at the State and local levels and funding
more targeted demonstration grants on specific topics to governmental units and private agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This period of promise and opportunity for child welfare comes at a time when a mix of social, cultural and economic
forces are placing pressures on children and families as well as on child welfare professionals and agencies. Sweeping
transformations in the domestic labor market, rising rates of child and family poverty, numerous health care crises,
greater numbers of teen pregnancies, the AIDS and substance abuse epidemics, and increasing levels of interpersonal
and community violence are cumulatively taking a toll on child and family well-being. Steadily rising caseloads,
consisting of much more complex cases involving more severe presenting problems, are confronting service programs
for children and families at the State and local level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the country child welfare agency administrators, practitioners, and university-based personnel are
demonstrating resiliency and creativity in response to these circumstances. Skilled and knowledgeable child welfare
professionals are devising innovative and exemplary solutions to these numerous challenges, more often than not,
in the face of insufficient human, material and financial resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to more fully meet the promise and potential the current period offers, and more fully compensate for and overcome
existing resource deficiencies, State and other publicly supported child welfare agencies are in need of capacity-building.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Resource Centers for Child Welfare Services Programs are vital to making the most of this opportunity for
progress and accomplishment by providing States and other publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare
agencies the quality training, technical assistance and consultation they need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the current opportunity to revitalize child welfare, the role and responsibilities of National Resource
Centers assume strategic importance. The Children's Bureau seeks to fund five National Resource Centers for Child
Welfare Services Programs which individually and collectively can make a meaningful contribution to the revitalization
effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These National Resource Centers are expected to build collaborative working relationships with relevant programs
and other training and technical assistance providers funded by Federal agencies and foundations. They are to establish
effective linkages and appropriate coordination with the Community-Based Family Resource Program, the National
Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's (NCCAN) Emergency Services Technical Services Contractor, and with three statewide
Family Resource and Support model projects funded by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB). They will also play
major roles in support of the Training and Technical Assistance Resource Coordination Contract to be funded by the
Children's Bureau in FY 94. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This network of National Resource Centers possessing the expertise, knowledge and skills to provide quality resources,
training, technical assistance, consultation, and related services is to have a central role in improving and strengthening
child welfare. Support for this network of National Resource Centers reflects a commitment by the Children's Bureau
to enhance the policy environment and the continuum of services for the benefit of children, families and agencies.

5. Priority Area 1.01A National Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As increasing social, economic and personal stresses place greater numbers of families and children potentially
at-risk and as the numbers of actual at-risk children and families have continued to expand, many State, local and
Tribal governments have implemented or are actively planning to initiate family preservation and support programs
as a way to strengthen vulnerable families. There is also widespread hope that these family-centered services will
reduce foster care caseloads and out-of-home care costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Family-centered services are responsive to certain legislative mandates of Public Law 96&hyph;272, the Adoption

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, and are central to the legislative intent of the new Subpart 2 of title IV&hyph;B
of the Social Security Act, Family Preservation and Support Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``family-centered'' encompasses both family preservation and family support activities. Family support
entails community-based preventive services designed to: alleviate stress and promote parental competencies
and behaviors that will increase the ability of families to successfully nurture their children; enable families
to use other resources and opportunities available in the community; create supportive networks to enhance child-rearing
abilities of parents; and help compensate for the increased social isolation, economic deficiencies and vulnerability
of families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Family preservation involves helping families maintain the safety of children in their own homes; alleviate crises
that might lead to the out-of-home care of children; avoid the unnecessary out-of-home placement of children; reunify
with their children and youth already in out-of-home care; deal with issues that arise in both pre and post-adoption
periods; and obtain services and other supports responsive to their multiple needs in a culturally appropriate manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Child welfare agencies need to develop and/or enhance their capacity to plan, manage, operate and monitor family-centered
services, and build collaborative working relationships with community-based organizations providing family
support programs. The National Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice will help child and family service
agencies develop expertise in all phases and aspects of administering family-centered services by providing training
and technical assistance itself or by providing a referral to an appropriate alternative resource. The National
Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice will focus most of its activity on the preventive end (i.e., prevention
of family dysfunction/foster care) of the continuum of services for children and families. In addition to meeting
the minimum requirements detailed previously, applicants need to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Demonstrate the capacity to articulate a family-centered approach, encompassing family preservation and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Describe a plan for collecting, reviewing and disseminating analyses of existing research and other appropriate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Describe a plan for providing techniques and strategies that will assist child welfare decisionmakers in

6. Priority Area 1.01B&blank;National Resource Center for Permanency Planning
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. During a brief period of time in the late 1970's and early 1980's the number of children placed in foster care was decreasing.
Many child welfare experts attribute this decline to attention and activities addressing permanency planning which
occurred in the period around the passage of Public Law 96&hyph;272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act
of 1980. Since the mid-1980's, the number of children in foster care has shown continuous growth. These children and
their biological and foster families constitute a large and costly segment of the population served by child welfare
agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies are faced with the challenge of responding to the increasing demand for services with quality and cost-effective
programs. They are expected to plan and achieve permanence for children in foster care and conform to the procedures
and safeguards spelled out in both State and Federal statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the emergence of new and more severe child and family problems has put additional pressure on agencies
to develop and deliver more complex services and has made the planning for and attainment of permanency more complicated.
Agencies are often hard pressed to offer the specialized and therapeutic foster family environments more children
entering foster care appear to need. Providing services to the families of children in care and attending to the legal
and service issues related to permanency planning have been especially problematic. Finally, the declassification
of many public child welfare positions and the loosening of strong ties between public agencies and social work education
is believed to have contributed to an erosion of practice quality and compromised achieving permanency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there is an emphasis on providing familial settings for children and youth, large numbers of young people still
are placed in residential care facilities. Although quality residential care can be a useful temporary resource
for certain children and youth, a lack of suitable alternatives means that far too often a residential placement is
used to care for young people when it may not be appropriate. Establishing permanence for this segment of the foster
care population is often more challenging than with children in family foster care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Resource Center for Permanency Planning will help children and family services agencies improve their
capacity to accomplish permanence through the development and implementation of high quality foster family and
residential care for children who must be removed from their homes. In addition to addressing the minimum requirements
detailed previously, applicants need to:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Child welfare agencies confront demanding management and human resource development issues. In regard to management
issues, agencies are faced with the formidable task of developing, implementing and evaluating an expanding range
of programs and services for more varied and challenging families and children. These programs and services are often
funded under broad and complex legislation and accompanying regulations which delineate appropriate agency practices
and behaviors. Often embedded in child welfare statutes and regulations are criteria to which agencies are held accountable.
Agencies find it challenging to simultaneously establish a broader repertoire of service programs and meet mounting
accountability and regulatory requirements. Agencies' ability to blend funding streams and link programs to provide
more holistic services to families and children is daunting but doable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to human resources, the idiosyncracies of State civil service systems, pressures for professional licensure
of social service agency staff, the inherent rigidity of bureaucratic systems, and high turnover rates at all levels
complicate and often compromise the ability of agencies to attend and respond to staffing needs. This subsequently
impairs the ability of staff to meet the needs of families and children.

8. Priority Area 1.01D&blank;National Resource Center for Youth Development. The pressures on and dissolution
of greater numbers of families coupled with negative social forces and peer pressure has resulted in higher levels
of family conflict and increasing numbers of youth struggling with the problems of maintaining effective school
performance, homelessness, substance abuse/addiction, prostitution, delinquency, pregnancy and suicide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuing difficulties in attaining permanency means many youth remain in foster care without returning to their
biological family or becoming and remaining part of an adoptive family. This sizeable population of youth needs to
be prepared for self-sufficiency, independence, and effective community living. These youth need assistance in
seeking additional education or training, and help in securing employment, finding housing/living arrangements,
learning about parenting as they form their own families, and linking with family/social/community supports.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is also growing societal concern regarding the problem of anti-social violent youth. While the juvenile justice
and adult correctional systems are dealing with the most severe adolescent actions, the child welfare foster care
system is also having to respond to the needs of youth whose behavior makes it impossible for them to remain with their
families or in their communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Youth in the child welfare system are too often only marginally served by existing agencies and the service delivery
system. Most child welfare agencies are hard pressed to develop quality programs and services for this growing population
of older adolescents who have more complex challenges, and who are not as likely to be in residential care due to the
deinstitutionalization movement, the decriminalization of status offenders, and budgetary cutbacks targeting
group care institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Resource Center for Youth Development will help agencies develop the capacity to effectively meet the
needs of youth. This category of youth includes primarily individuals from the age of puberty through age 21. However,
this definition does not exclude consideration of the service needs of individuals who may be slightly younger or
older than the primary target population. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements detailed previously,
applicants need to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Describe a plan for collecting and disseminating educational and occupational related resource materials
and information on issues including, but not limited to, special education, post-secondary education including
vocational and two and four-year academic programs, school drop-out prevention, establishing and maintaining

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Child welfare agencies administer child welfare programs within a framework of law. The passage of major pieces of
child welfare legislation has prompted continuous reassessment and redefinition of the relationship between State
child welfare agencies and the judiciary. Appropriate responses to confirmed cases of abuse and neglect, termination
of parental rights, and adoption proceedings are eventually settled in the courts. Periodic judicial review of foster
care cases is a Federal statutory requirement. It is not unheard of for judges in some jurisdictions to actually develop
case plans for individual clients, and give casework directives to agency staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legislatively mandated judicial involvement in the details of case practice has often forced agencies to analyze
and interpret legal issues, court decisions, and judicial pronouncements; determine their implications for programs
and practices; and review and revise their policies and procedures accordingly. Faced with an expanding statutory
and regulatory base, the legal staff of public child welfare agencies have gradually assumed a greater responsibility
for maintaining legal and regulatory compliance and consequently have acquired greater influence in shaping agency
activity. In addition, liability concerns are substantially influencing agency practice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To assist in the coordination of services, exchange of information and the continuing development, expansion and
strengthening and improvement in the quality and effectiveness of programs described in Public Law 102&hyph;236,
the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988, as amended (Act) whether or not the service providers receive funds
authorized under the Act. The Act provides financial support for demonstration projects to prevent the abandonment
of infants and young children, particularly those with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or who have been perinatally
exposed to the virus or who have been perinatally exposed to a dangerous drug; to identify and address the needs of those
infants and young children who are, or are at risk of being abandoned; to develop a program of comprehensive services
for those children and their families which will strengthen family functioning and prevent abandonment, including
family foster care, case management, family support, respite care and crisis intervention, counseling and group
residential care services; and to recruit and train health and social services personnel, foster care families and
residential providers to meet the needs of infants and young children who are at risk of abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Background Information:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since 1990, ACYF has awarded a total of 42 grants under the Abandoned Infants Assistance Program (AIA) to a variety
of agencies, including State and local departments of social and health services; hospitals; universities; and
private, nonprofit, child-serving agencies. These projects include comprehensive service demonstration programs,
training projects and resource coordination efforts. Currently, there are 32 comprehensive service demonstration
programs in operation. In addition, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Center for Substance Abuse Programs
fund related activities. These programs are designed to meet the immediate social service and health care needs of
infants and young children and their families impacted by HIV infection and drug exposure; to address issues of community
coordination; to improve utilization of scarce resources; and to develop systems which will meet the long-term needs
of the children and their families. Also, many local jurisdictions nationwide are implementing programs, with or
without federal assistance, that provide services to the same target populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current National Abandoned Infant Assistance Resource Center for Drug-, HIV, and Medically Involved Children,
funded from September, 1991 through September, 1994, provides training, technical assistance and consultation
to the AIA programs and related activities in order to improve service delivery to drug and HIV-exposed infants, young
children and their families; provides training to social service, health and other workers in order to educate them
about program and services for families who are at risk of abandoning their children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a substantial number of abandoned infants and related projects have been established, knowledge about
effective strategies and services continues to evolve and develop. Existing programs vary considerably in terms
of quality, experience and intervention strategies. However, the demand for such services is increasing as substance
abuse and HIV infection impact on greater number of infants and young children and their families. ACF intends to continue
to support a National Resource Center to assist in identifying, developing and utilizing effective program practices,
information and materials in order to meet this service demand; and to continue to provide training and technical
assistance as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine that the applicant organization
is an eligible applicant as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do
not meet the eligibility requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition,
and the applicant will be so informed.

B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timely applications from eligible applicants will be reviewed and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally
persons from outside of the Federal government, will use the evaluation criteria listed in Section C, Evaluation
Criteria, to review and score the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACYF reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding
sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit
comments from ACYF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations,
specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will
be considered by ACYF in making funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making decisions on awards, ACYF may give preference to applications which demonstrate or feature: Experience
in providing complex training and technical assistance in child welfare and/or related fields; an eclectic approach
to the substantive content of each topical area; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available
for the proposed project; and the potential for high benefit for the level of Federal investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the greatest extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution
of assistance across geographic regions of the country.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Abandoned Infants Program is covered under Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,
and 45 CFR Part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Program and Activities.
Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau,
have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs).
Applicants from these 18 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants
should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office
can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required
materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required)
on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. For this particular announcement a waiver of the 60 day period has been approved and SPOC's are asked to provide
comments within 30 days of the application deadline. The 30 day SPOC comment period provides all potential applicants
with a full 60 days for application preparation and submission. This will allow for the greatest number of applicants,
and also not give an advantage to applicants who have received similar awards in the past. The 30 day SPOC comment period
ensures that all applications can be thoroughly developed and reviewed, and that awards can be made in FY 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State
process recommendations which may trigger the accommodate or explain rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and the estimated dollar amounts of the awards as part of the budget justification. Whenever the applicant/grantee
intends to delegate part or all of the program to another agency, the applicant/grantee must complete this section
(Section B, Budget Categories) for each delegate agency by agency title, along with the supporting information.
The total cost of all such agencies will be part of the amount shown on Line 6f. Provide backup documentation identifying
the name of contractor, purpose of contract, and major cost elements. Applicants who anticipate procurements that
will exceed $5,000 (non- governmental entities) or $25,000 (governmental entities) and are requesting an award

This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.

Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Violence Against Women (VAW) is defined as threatened or actual use of physical force against a woman that either results
or has the potential to result in injury or death. This type of violence includes the physical, sexual, or psychological
assault of women by partners, intimates, family members, and acquaintances. Commonly referenced types of behavior
that fit within this definition include family and intimate violence, spouse abuse, partner abuse (including same
sex relationships), women battering, courtship violence, sexual assault, and date rape. Public health approaches
violence as a health issue and consequently, uses injuries, both fatal and nonfatal, psychological and physical,
to quantify the impact of violence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this announcement, the area of attention is in primary prevention of violence against adolescent
(12+ years of age) and adult women by persons known to the victim (family members, partners, and intimates) rather
than by strangers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interventions for VAW may encompass training/education, legal (e.g., mandatory arrest policies), behavioral,
or environmental change strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multifaceted programs are programs which incorporate multiple interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of
VAW and that results in injury or death. Since beliefs and behaviors are difficult to change, effective prevention
models require a combination of interventions that provide specific strategies for establishing a coordinated
program. For multifaceted programs to be effective, interventions must be complementary. For example, the benefits
of referral protocols are potentiated by expanding emergency shelter and support services for victims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No single solution has been effective in the prevention of VAW. To maximize effectiveness, primary prevention programs
should be based on multiple complementary interventions in multiple settings. These programs should be community-based
and tailored to meet the specific needs of the community, including the most effective strategies and personnel.
Supporting and empowering communities to develop effective prevention programs will represent an essential model
for delivering interventions for those in need. The community-based model has been successful in dealing with other
public health prevention efforts such as HIV prevention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Local Planning Group (LPG) is defined as a team of individuals drawn from community-based organizations, State and
local health departments, and a local college or university. The LPG would collaborate in the design, implementation,
and evaluation of the proposed VAW prevention program. A female victim of intimate violence should be included as
an additional team member. The LPG team participants will serve as advisors and consultants on the practical and scientific
aspects of the proposed intervention and evaluation activities. Each member or group represented on the LPG must
have its proposed activities, responsibilities, and contributions to the success of the project clearly defined
in the ``Application Content'' section of the application. Applicants should also see the ``Program Requirements''
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Full working partners are defined as any of the organizations or institutions that are collaborating in the VAW prevention
project either through participation on the local planning group or in some other substantive way. It is essential
that full working partners' duties, responsibilities, and contributions to the success of the project are clearly
defined in the ``Application Content'' section of the application. Applicants should also see the ``Program Requirements''
section. For example, a full working partner may have access to the community (target population) that the applicant
does not possess. Because the full working partner is substantially involved in the project, the applicant can state
that the project as a whole has community access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary prevention is defined as the reduction or control of causative factors for a health problem and includes reducing
risk factors and environmental exposures, and includes health-service interventions.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes of this program are to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Identify or develop potentially effective intervention strategies for delivering VAW primary prevention at
the community level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Design and implement multifaceted community-based VAW primary prevention programs based on these interventions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Evaluate the extent to which the multifaceted community programs reduce rates of violent behavior, injury, and
death among intimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Develop formal replication guidelines from successful programs for disseminating model VAW prevention programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a number of existing interventions and/or programs to prevent VAW are perceived as useful, little is actually
known about their effectiveness, their impact on women, and their ability to be replicated in a variety of settings.
Evaluation will help identify those programs that demonstrate the greatest promise for primary prevention. Model
programs should be able to address a particularly important type of VAW or address violence in special settings. Comprehensive,
multifaceted, and innovative efforts to address VAW may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Public awareness campaigns to dispel misconceptions about VAW as well as change knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs
pertaining to VAW. This could include school-based curricula, college- and university-based efforts, and work-site
education programs (non-Federal); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Coordination among the criminal justice system, family and intimate violence programs, substance abuse programs,
mental health centers, and the medical community for referral, intervention, shelter, and case management. This
could include: (a) Victim identification and referral protocols in hospital emergency rooms, community clinics,
and other health care settings, (b) expansion of emergency shelter and support services for victims, and (c) worksite
programs (non-Federal) including identification and referral for victims through employee assistance programs
and worksite (non-Federal) promotional campaigns; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Expansion of court-ordered treatment programs for abusers which would include intensive counseling and behavior
modification treatment; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Training and education programs for professionals in health care, legal, and social service fields who deal with
potential victims and abusers or who are involved in the planning and implementation of prevention programs.

Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI&hyph;35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A&hyph;16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<DOCTITLE>Final Funding Priorities for Cooperative Agreements for Area Health Education Centers Program for Fiscal Year 1994
</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final funding priorities for fiscal year
1994, Cooperative Agreements for the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) Program authorized under the authority
of section 746 (a)(l), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education
Extension Amendments of 1992, dated October 13, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 746(a)(1) of the PHS Act authorizes Federal assistance to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine which
have cooperative arrangements with one or more public or nonprofit private area health education centers for the
planning, development and operation of area health education center programs.

Final Funding Priorities for FY 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed funding priorities were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 17, 1994, at 59 FR 8000, for public comment. Several comments were received from one respondent. Comments
on aspects of the proposed notice which were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed in this
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The respondent suggested a change in the funding priority proposed for applicants which demonstrate an increase
in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care Residency for the most recent 3-year period. The respondent
suggested that this priority be expanded to include awarding of the priority to applicants who have, during the most
recent 3-year period, maintained a percentage of graduates entering a Primary Care Residency which substantially
exceeds the average for all U.S. medical schools. This addition to the proposed funding priority would aid medical
schools which may be maintaining a high percentage, i.e., 50&hyph;60 percent, compared to medical schools which
may show a significant increase but start at a lower percentage, i.e., increase from 15 to 25 percent. It should be noted
that an average percentage for all U.S. medical schools (osteopathic and allopathic) would most likely be lower than
the 50&hyph;60 percent, example cited, and would not encourage schools to focus their efforts on increasing their
percentage of graduates entering a Primary Care Residency. The second comment was related to the funding priority
proposed for applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minorities for the
most recent 3-year period. The respondent suggested that for this priority the term ``minority'' should be used rather
than underrepresented minority. The intent of this funding priority is to reward those applicants who show progress
in reaching underrepresented minority populations. It is understood that data necessary to establish that specific
populations or subpopulations are underrepresented in a specific discipline may not be readily accessible, or may
differ in terms of data reported to medical school associations. Efforts were made in the application materials to
assist applicants by allowing data to be presented in two ways, in a manner similar to that provided to their medical
school association, or to present student applicant data related to the number and percent of minority population
in the State where the applicant is based. All of the data on minorities presented by the applicants will be reviewed,
recognizing that ``underrepresented minorities'' is defined for all applicants to this program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the final funding priorities will be retained as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A funding priority be given to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care (Family
Medicine, General Internal Medicine, General Pediatrics) Residency, for the most recent 3-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minority graduates for the most
recent 3-year period.

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the principal biomedical and behavioral research agency within the Federal
Government. Its mission is to improve human health by increasing scientific knowledge related to health and disease
through the conduct and support of biomedical and behavioral research. The NIH advances its mission through intramural
research activity and the award of research grants and contracts to institutions of higher education, research institutes
and foundations, and other non-profit and for-profit organizations. Entities funded through NIH research grants,
contracts, and cooperative agreements (hereafter collectively referred to as Grantees) are required to maximize
the use of their research findings by making them available to the research community and the public at large and through
their timely and effective transfer to industry for development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, interactions between Grantees and industry take many forms, including industrial liaison programs,
spinoff companies, consortia, commercial licenses, material transfers, consultations, and clinical trial agreements.
This document addresses one form of Grantee/industry interaction, sponsored research agreements, on which the
NIH has focused a substantial amount of its recent attention. Sponsored research agreements are agreements between
Grantees and commercial entities in which Grantees receive funding or other consideration to support their research
in return for preferential access and/or rights to intellectual property deriving from their research results.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing sponsored research agreements, Grantees must consider the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (hereafter referred to as ``Bayh-Dole'' or ``the Act'') and NIH funding agreements and refrain from engaging in activities
which undermine a Grantee's ability to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations to the Federal government.
Although Grantees are primarily responsible for the implementation of the Act, NIH, as a steward of Federal funds,
has a responsibility to provide guidance on issues regarding sponsored research agreements which may put Grantees
at odds with the Act or NIH funding requirements.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this document is to provide Grantees with issues and points to consider in developing sponsored research
agreements with commercial entities. The intent is to assist Grantees in ensuring that those agreements comply with
the requirements of the Act and NIH funding agreements while upholding basic principles of academic freedom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document represents the culmination of various activities, under the aegis of the NIH Task Force on Commercialization
of Intellectual Property Rights from NIH Supported Extramural Research, which included the review and analysis
of 375 sponsored research agreements from 100 Grantees, meetings with industry, academia, and other Government
agencies, and a specially convened public forum involving subject matter experts from outside of the NIH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH recognizes that sponsored research agreements are unique, creative devices which reflect the needs and interests
of the parties involved and require a delicate balance of risks and benefits to all of the parties. Although this document
identifies a number of points to consider, with some necessitating more scrutiny than others, no single point or issue
is so dominant that it is likely to be fatal to an agreement. Rather, the juxtaposition of multiple factors or clauses
in an agreement and their synergy needs to be assessed. Therefore, Grantees should review the provisions of proposed
sponsored research agreements both individually and in their totality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While NIH policies on the use of research results have been in effect for some time, commercial development of research
results took a major step forward with the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. Congress passed the Act in response to significant
concerns about the United States' competitiveness and data indicating that rights to many inventions developed
under Federal grants and contracts and assigned to the Federal government were not being commercialized. In general,
the Act authorizes Grantees to retain title to inventions resulting from their Federally funded research and to license
such inventions to commercial entities for development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the policy and objective of the Bayh-Dole are to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations, including universities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promote the utilization of inventions arising from Federally supported research or development; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Encourage maximum participation of small business firms in Federally sponsored research and development
efforts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that inventions made by nonprofit organizations and small business firms are used to promote free competition
and enterprise; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States
industry and labor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that the Government obtains sufficient rights in Federally sponsored inventions to meet the needs
of the Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Minimize the costs of administering policies in this area.

Grantee Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the objectives and policy of Bayh-Dole, it is incumbent upon Grantees to effectively and efficiently
transfer technology to industry for commercial development. However, in doing so Grantees must also comply with
the specific terms of the Act, its implementing regulations, and the terms and conditions of each NIH award and ensure
that such compliance is reflected in their agreements with commercial entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In carrying out that responsibility, at a minimum, Grantees need to concern themselves with issues involving maintenance
of academic freedom for institutions and investigators, fair access to information, timeliness of notification
and other requirements, rational licensing to commercial entities, and adherence to the specific requirements
of the Act and NIH funding agreements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While sponsored research agreements frequently are used where basic research is involved and no invention exists
to disclose nor intellectual property to license at the time the agreement is executed, Grantees should anticipate
such issues to arise and use the following points for consideration in developing a sponsored research agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first section, Universal Points for Consideration, highlights several requirements and issues that Grantees
should consider in all proposed sponsored research agreements. The second section, Points for Special Consideration,
delineates circumstances which suggest heightened scrutiny. The third section, Other Points for Consideration
by Non Profit Grantees, contains additional considerations which apply only to non profit Grantees.

Universal Points for Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Academic Freedom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Academic research freedom based upon social collaboration within the scientific community and the scrutiny of claims
and beliefs by its members is at the heart of scientific advancement within the United States. Primarily through Federal
funding, academic institutions have contributed to fundamental knowledge and techniques upon which current and
future scientific discoveries and technological innovations depend. Therefore, the preservation of academic
freedom for Grantee institutions and researchers is of considerable concern to the NIH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees should be aware that their interest in the scientific endeavor covered by a sponsored research agreement
and the interest of the industrial sponsor may not be totally consonant. As a result, in general, Grantees should ensure
that sponsored research agreements preserve the freedom for academic researchers to select projects, collaborate
with other scientists, determine the types of sponsored research activities in which they wish to participate, and
communicate their research findings at meetings, and by publication and through other means.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Academic researchers also should be made aware of any agreements executed by their institutions which may restrict
their ability to pursue research activities and publish research results. Grantees also should maintain their independence
to pursue their own mission without undue influence or restraint by their industrial sponsors. For example, an agreement
which gives an industrial sponsor the ability to direct the research mission of a Grantee would be inappropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIH recognizes that there may be certain instances when it may be reasonable for a Grantee institution to agree
to minimally restrict a researcher from collaborating with another industrial partner when the subject matter of
such collaboration overlaps with that of the sponsored research agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Dissemination of Research Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must ensure that the timely dissemination of research findings is not adversely affected by the conditions
of a sponsored research agreement. For example, the PHS Grants Policy Statement, incorporated as a condition of each
NIH research grant, details policies on publication of research results, responsibilities to disseminate information
on unique research resources, and standards of conduct for Grantee employees. Although an industrial sponsor's
consideration of the commercial applicability of specific research findings and/or the filing of a patent application
to secure intellectual property rights may justify a need to delay disclosure of research findings, a delay of up to
thirty (30) days is generally viewed as a reasonable period for such activity. Depending upon the individual circumstances,
Grantees could consider a shorter or longer period of time, as they deem appropriate. In addition to the timing, a sponsored
research agreement which requires the disclosure of inventions and research findings developed with NIH funds to
an industrial sponsor prior to submission of the invention disclosure to the NIH, may be inconsistent with the terms
and conditions of the NIH grant or contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Utilization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIH also has a concern that Federally funded technology be developed and commercialized in an expedited and efficient
manner. In deciding to enter into an agreement with an commercial entity, Grantees should consider whether the organization
has the experience, capability, and commitment to bring its likely inventions to commercial status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Grantees should not enter into sponsored research agreements that permit a sponsor to tie up the development
of a technology by acquiring exclusive licensing rights to the product of given research results before deciding
whether or not it will actively develop and commercialize that product. Grantees should provide a sponsor with an
option to pursue licensing rights. It is reasonable for such options to be limited to no more than six (6) months. However,
individual circumstances may dictate a shorter or longer period of time. After the option period expires, the technology
should become available for licensing to other entities. Moreover, once a sponsor decides not to exercise its option,
it should not be given a second opportunity to obtain licensing rights by matching other parties' offers for the rights.
Such requirements enable Grantees to license to companies presenting a bona fide commercialization plan, thus expediting
the availability of products to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that technology is developed rapidly and is not being subjected to delays, Grantees should also
establish, maintain, and actively administer policies and procedures which ensure that licenses arising from sponsored
research agreements contain due diligence requirements and benchmarks to monitor performance. When future rights
to as yet undiscovered inventions are included in a sponsored research agreement, benchmarks for development of
each such invention should be established as it becomes available for commercial development. In addition, Grantees
should actively monitor licensees in accordance with those requirements and benchmarks to assure compliance with
Grantee obligations under the Act.

U.S. Manufacture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bayh-Dole Act requires that products developed with Federal funds and used and sold in the United States, be substantially
manufactured here. In granting exclusive rights to use or sell any subject invention in the United States, Grantees
must ensure that each agreement requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the
use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. In individual cases, a request
for waiver may be considered by the NIH. A determination will be made based upon a showing by the Grantee that reasonable
but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely
to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially
feasible. In granting a waiver of the U.S. manufacture requirement, the NIH may consider other benefits conferred
on the United States by the potential license including the rapid availability of a product of benefit to the health
of the American people.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sponsored research agreements, as in other contexts, Grantees must also ensure that invention, patent and license
notification requirements are adhered to in a timely manner. Timeliness considerations include prompt (1) employee
notification to Grantee administrators of an invention made under NIH funding, (2) written disclosure to NIH of an
invention and the intent to retain or convey to the Government title to the invention, (3) adherence to time frames
for initial filing of patent applications in the United States and the filing of foreign patent applications, (4)
execution and confirmation throughout the world of NIH license rights in the results of the research, and (5) notification
to the NIH of any decision not to continue patent prosecution, pay fees, or defend the patent in reexamination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, as conditions of NIH grants and cooperative agreements, Grantees must fully notify the NIH in a timely
manner when an invention has been developed. In any event, disclosure to the NIH must be prior to the publication of
any description of the invention. When applying for continued funding in each subsequent funding period, the institution
must also provide either a listing of all inventions made during the preceding budget period or a certification that
no inventions were made during the applicable period. A final invention statement and certification listing all
inventions that were conceived or first actually reduced to practice during the course of work under the funding agreement
is required within ninety (90) days following the expiration or termination of support on an applicable project.
Additionally, Grantees need to adhere to the specific requirements contained in the patent clauses of their contracts
as well as the general provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, Grantees must also document their compliance with the requirements of the Act, regulations, and terms
and conditions of NIH awards, generally and as related to sponsored research agreements. Such Grantee records must
be available for review by authorized Federal officials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.
For example, concerning access and retention of records under NIH grants and cooperative agreements, regulations
require grantees to retain financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and
all other grantee records which may reasonably be considered pertinent to a grant or subgrant.

Points for Special Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIH has identified several situations, outlined below, in which Grantees should exercise heightened sensitivity
and scrutiny in the development of sponsored research agreements. Such an exercise should confirm that a sponsored
research agreement does not adversely impact NIH funded activities and Grantee concerns such as academic freedom,
or shift control of the Grantee's scientific activities, management, and independence into the hands of the sponsor.
While there is no requirement that Grantees submit proposed sponsored research agreements to the NIH for review,
at the discretion of the Grantee, the NIH may be consulted for additional clarification in instances where special
considerations warrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, Grantees should subject their sponsored research agreements to heightened scrutiny when one or more of the
following threshold criteria apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the amount of financial support from the sponsor meets or exceeds $5 million in any one year, or, $50 million total
over the total period of funding under the agreement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the proportion of funding by the sponsor exceeds 20 per cent of the Grantee's total research funding; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the sponsor's prospective licensing rights cover all technologies developed by a major group or component of
the Grantee organization, such as a large laboratory, department or center, or the technologies in question represent
a substantial proportion of the anticipated intellectual output of the Grantee's research staff; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) the duration of the agreement is for 5 or more years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If one or more of these criteria apply, it is more likely that the proposed sponsored research agreement will adversely
affect open commercial access, especially for small businesses, to a Grantee's Federally funded research activities
and may delay or impede the rapid development and commercialization of technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, Grantees should be concerned if the scope of the sponsored research agreement is so broad that the subsequent
exclusive licensing of technology under the agreement provides a single sponsor with access to a wide array of Grantee
research findings and technologies that effectively exclude other organizations from reasonable access to a Grantee's
technology. This type of arrangement can also delay commercialization if the sponsor does not have the interest or
the capability to develop the technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, if the sponsor contributes funds to support a Grantee's general operations rather than specifically defined
research projects, the Grantee should consider the amount of the sponsor's general funding in relation to funds contributed
from other sources when determining what prospective intellectual property rights the (sponsor will receive in
the results of the Grantee's entire research portfolio. There should be a reasonable relationship between the amount
of money contributed by the sponsor and the rights that it is granted both to review and license resulting technology
or inventions. As an extreme example, a sponsor should not be able to provide 5 percent of the Grantee's total support,
review 100 percent of the Grantee's inventions, and receive rights or a first option to 50 percent of the research results
generated by the Grantee. Where general funding is involved, a Grantee should consider establishing some mechanism
to limit the review and licensing rights of the sponsor to a particular segment or percentage of the inventions and
for a set period of time. For example, the Grantee may require the sponsor to select those research areas or projects
to which its general funding rights would attach in advance, thereby freeing up research areas that may be of interest
to other commercial entities. Because, by its nature, general funding is less directed and its results more imprecise,
Grantees should carefully monitor the impact on open competition and fair access by small business of the sponsor's
licensing practices for technology supported by general funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, Grantees should avoid any other unusual practice or stipulation that might generate public concern or undermine
rather than serve the public interest.

Other Points for Consideration by Non-Profit Grantees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following points are to aid non-profit Grantees in administering the Act and in complying with the requirements
of NIH funding agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, Grantees must ensure that the rights to inventions resulting from Federal funding are not assigned without
NIH approval. An exception to this is when the assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions
the management of inventions, in which case, the assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Grantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, Grantees must share royalties collected on NIH supported inventions with the inventors and the balance of
any royalties or income earned, after payment of expenses, including payment to inventors and incidental expenses
to the administration of subject inventions, must be utilized for the support of scientific research or education.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, Grantees must employ reasonable efforts to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business
firms. Additionally, Grantees must provide a preference to small business firms when licensing a subject invention
if Grantees determine that small business firms have plans or proposals for marketing the invention which, if executed,
are equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that
are not small business firms. However, Grantees must be satisfied that the small business firms have the capability
and resources to carry out plans or proposals. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case is at the
discretion of the Grantee. However, since sponsored research agreements typically provide exclusive licenses
or options to such rights to the sponsor, Grantees should seriously consider and provide for these issues when negotiating
such agreements.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Technology transfer is a vehicle through which the fruits of NIH funded research are transferred to industry to be
ultimately developed into preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic products to advance human health. In a dynamic
and multinational marketplace, if the United States is to remain a world leader in technological and scientific innovation,
both the public and private sectors must work together to foster rapid development and commercialization of useful
products to benefit human health, stimulate the economy, and enhance our international competitiveness, while
at the same time protecting taxpayers' investment and safeguarding the principles of scientific integrity and academic
freedom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is in this spirit that the NIH encourages Grantees to address the issues and apply the points for consideration identified
in this document when developing sponsored research agreements with commercial entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Vol. 58, No. 166 pages 45494&hyph;5, August 30, 1993) NIH had announced that several fields of use for TGF-beta were
available for licensing. Since this time, two additional fields of use have become available for non-exclusive licensing:
1) the nonsystemic administration of TGF-beta for repair of soft tissue; and 2) the systemic administration of TGF-beta
for treatment or prevention of vascular ischemia and/or reperfusion injury. The following patents and patent applications
covering TGF-beta are available to be licensed: U.S. Patent 5,104,977 entitled ``Purified Transforming Growth
Factor Beta,'' U.S. patent application 08/048,956 entitled ``Promotion of Cell Proliferation by Use of Transforming
Growth Factor Beta,'' and foreign counterpart applications claiming priority from U.S. patent applications 06/468,590
and 06/500,833 both entitled ``Repair of Tissue in Animals.'' The patent rights in these inventions have been assigned
to the United States of America.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of
Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act (the Act) or
regulations when the Government has decided not to seek further review of that decision or is unsuccessful on further
review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will apply the holding of the Court of Appeals decision as explained in this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling
to claims at all levels of administrative adjudication within the Tenth Circuit. This Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling will apply to all determinations and decisions made on or after June 27, 1994. If we made a determination or decision
on your application for benefits between March 12, 1993, the date of the Court of Appeals decision, and June 27, 1994,
the effective date of this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling, you may request application of the Ruling to your
claim if you first demonstrate, pursuant to 20 CFR 404.985(b), that application of the Ruling could change our prior
determination or decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling is later rescinded as obsolete, we will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Whether the contributions for support by the father of an unborn child commensurate with the needs of the unborn child
at the time of the father's death establish support of the child in order to entitle the child to survivor's benefits
as a deemed child, even though the contributions to the child or the child's mother were not regular and substantial.
Further, whether the Secretary in determining if the worker was ``contributing to the support'' of the unborn child
must consider such contributions in relation to the worker's economic circumstances.

Description of Case:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Della Wolfe and Earl Bialczyk began living together in May 1988, although they maintained separate residences. During
the time they lived together, Bialczyk purchased groceries so Wolfe could fix his favorite breakfast, purchased
cigarettes for Wolfe, paid for her expenses when they went on dates, and installed an alternator in her car. In late
August 1988, Wolfe learned that she was pregnant and informed Bialczyk of the pregnancy two days later. The couple
separated in early September 1988. Bialczyk died on October 5, 1988. David Weyburn was born to Wolfe on April 26, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Weyburn's application for child's benefits on Bialczyk's earnings record was denied by initial and reconsideration
determinations. Pursuant to section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act (the Act), an ALJ found that Bialczyk
was not Weyburn's biological father and, at the time of his death, he was not living with or contributing to Weyburn's
or Wolfe's support. In concluding that the evidence did not establish that Bialczyk contributed to Weyburn's or Wolfe's
support, the ALJ decided that the contributions were not regular and substantial, in cash or kind. The Appeals Council
denied Weyburn's request for review of the ALJ's decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plaintiff sought judicial review alleging that the regular and substantial test was inappropriate with respect
to contributions to a posthumous illegitimate child. The district court affirmed the Secretary's decision and found
that the evidence did not prove that Bialczyk had contributed to Wolfe's support under either the regular and substantial
test or the more liberal criteria for evaluating contributions to a posthumous illegitimate child utilized by the
Ninth Circuit in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 Schweiker
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 681 F.2d 605 (9th Cir. 1982). Weyburn appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed
the judgment of the district court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Holding:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Court of Appeals agreed with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Doran
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court that the proper test for determining whether the father was ``contributing to the support'' of his posthumous
illegitimate child is whether the father's support was commensurate with the needs of the unborn child at the time
of the father's death. The court also agreed with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Doran
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the economic circumstances of the worker must be taken into account when making such a determination. The court
stated that support may be shown by proof that contributions were made to either the unborn child (e.g., baby clothes
or a crib) or the mother (e.g., food, shelter or medical care). The court further indicated that the contributions
to the mother must have been made with knowledge of the pregnancy and that expenditures intended for courtship of the
mother did not constitute contributions for support of the unborn child. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the unborn child needed only minimal support when Bialczyk died, the court ruled that the evidence did not
show that Bialczyk had contributed anything to Weyburn's or Wolfe's support after he learned of the pregnancy. Moreover,
the court found that the controlling date for evaluating contributions under section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act
was at the time of Bialczyk's death in October 1988. By that date, Wolfe and Bialczyk had ended their relationship and
the worker was no longer making any of the alleged contributions. The court concluded that, based on the record, the
evidence failed both to satisfy the Secretary's test or prove under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Doran
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria that Bialczyk had contributed to the child's support according to his ability. Because of this holding,
the court of appeals did not rule on the issue of the child's paternity.

Statement As To How Wolfe Differs From Social Security Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
According to the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) regulations implementing section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii)
of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(20 CFR 404.366(a)), ``contributions for support'' of the claimant must be made regularly and must be substantial.
To be substantial, contributions must be large enough to meet an important part of the ordinary living costs of the
claimant. A consistent pattern of contributions is sufficient to show regularity. Under SSR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
68-22, and SSA's operating instructions, the ``living with'' or ``contributing to the support'' requirements are
established for the posthumous child of a worker if the worker was living with, or contributing to the support of, the
child's mother at the time of the worker's death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In adopting the Doran
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wolfe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court stated that the proper test for contributions is whether the father's support was commensurate with the needs
of the unborn child at the time of the father's death, taking into account the father's economic circumstances at the
time of his death.

Explanation of How SSA Will Apply The Wolfe Decision In The Circuit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Ruling applies only to cases involving an applicant for child's benefits as a deemed child under section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii)
of the Act who resides in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah or Wyoming at the time of the determination or
decision at any administrative level, i.e., initial, reconsideration, ALJ hearing or Appeals Council, and who was
born after the worker died.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such an applicant will be deemed to be the worker's child when satisfactory evidence establishes that the worker is
the father of the child and the worker's contributions to his unborn child, at the time of his death, were commensurate
with the needs of the unborn child, even though the contributions were not regular and substantial. The economic circumstances
of the worker (i.e., ability to contribute) will also be taken into account in determining whether the worker was contributing
to the claimant's support. Support may be shown by proof that the worker made contributions to either the unborn child
(e.g., baby clothes or a crib) or the mother (e.g., food, shelter or medical care). The worker's contributions must
have been made with knowledge of the pregnancy. Expenditures intended for courtship of the mother will not be considered
contributions to the unborn child.

procedures of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (40 U.S.C. 1501
et seq.), the Department of Interior has prepared this record of decision on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Environmental Impact Statement, Black-Footed Ferret Reintroduction, Conata Basin/Badlands, South Dakota.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The record of decision is a concise statement of what decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and
acceptable mitigation measures developed in order to avoid or minimize environmental impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This reintroduction effort is an interagency program involving the Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service,
and the Forest Service. Each Agency has the responsibility under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, to
recover threatened and endangered species. Each Agency will prepare a separate record of decision to cover its respective
responsibilities under the reintroduction program.

The Selected Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preferred alternative, Alternative C, releases black-footed ferrets (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mustela nigripes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a nonessential experimental population into a reintroduction area of approximately 42,000 acres (16,997 ha)
on the Badlands National Park (BNP) and the Buffalo Gap National Grassland (BGNG). The initial reintroductions will
occur on the BNP. This area contains approximately 8,000 acres (3,238 ha) of black-tailed prairie dog colonies. A
nonessential experimental population area of approximately 1,182,200 acres is delineated within which the legal
status of the black-footed ferret is changed from endangered to nonessential experimental to allow for greater management
flexibility. All of the proposed reintroduction area is public land administered by either the National Park Service
or the Forest Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the proposed action is to use experimental techniques to reintroduce and establish a free ranging,
cooperatively managed wild population of black-footed ferrets in the Conata Basin/Badlands experimental population
area near Wall, South Dakota. The released black-footed ferrets and their progeny will be classified as a nonessential
experimental population under Federal rulemaking requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five alternatives, including the preferred alternative, were analyzed in the final environmental impact statement.
All action alternatives propose to reintroduce black-footed ferrets as a nonessential experimental population.
The alternatives included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative A_Black-footed ferrets would not be reintroduced into BNP or BGNG (No Action).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative B_Black-footed ferrets would be released only in BNP in a reintroduction area of approximately 25,000
acres which contains about 3,200 acres of prairie dog colonies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative D_Reintroduce black-footed ferrets into a 42,000 acre reintroduction area on BNP and BGNG with initial
releases in BGNG. The reintroduction area is similar to that of Alternative C and contains approximately 8,000 acres
of prairie dog colonies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative E_Release black-footed ferrets into a 172,000 acre reintroduction area on BNP and BGNG consisting of
the entire north unit of the BNP and the BGNG in the Conata Basin. No priority release site is identified in this alternative.
The initial black-footed ferret releases would occur in the most biologically suitable habitat within the reintroduction
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmentally Preferable Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service consider Alternative E to be the most environmentally preferred alternative. The levels
of active prairie dog habitat would not increase over Alternatives C and D. Alternative E provides the least potential
risks to the black-footed ferret due to expanded protection measures through the expansion of off-road travel and
trapping restriction and possible long-term shooting restrictions to an expanded reintroduction area. Alternative
C was selected because it prescribes a reintroduction program that is more compatible with the existing recreational
and agricultural land uses in the area thereby garnishing additional support. It is the Fish and Wildlife Service's
assessment that the benefits of additional support outweigh the possible benefits of extending land use restrictions
associated with the expanded reintroduction area of Alternative E.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Minimization of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public concerns, potential impacts, and methods to mitigate those impacts are addressed in the final environmental
impact statement. The Fish and Wildlife Service considers that all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental
impacts that could result from implementation of the preferred plan have been identified and are considered acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service will accept the proposed action to release captive reared black-footed ferrets into
the Conata Basin/Badlands area near Wall, South Dakota as described in Alternative C in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Environmental Impact Statement, Black-Footed Ferret Reintroduction, Conata Basin/Badlands, South Dakota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful evaluation of each alternative and considering the issues of public response; legislative intent;
management objectives; and cost, socioeconomic, and environmental effects, the Fish and Wildlife Service believes
that the proposed action represents the most balanced course of action for the future management of the black-footed
ferret.

RATIONALE FOR DECISION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Preferred alternative has been selected for implementation based on consideration of a number of environmental
and social factors. Alternative A has been selected as the preferred alternative because: (1) The land exchange provides
the most durable means for protecting wildlife habitats and exchange wildlife populations; (2) the development
component avoids significant adverse environmental impacts; and (3) the project will result in significant economic
benefits in a economically depressed area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative A was selected because it balances resources protection with water dependent development. The preferred
alternative provides a net benefit for wildlife and benefits for the local economy. The land exchange is the most practical
means available to secure and protect additional lands from incompatible uses within the administrative boundary
of the Refuge. Migratory bird and resident wildlife populations will benefit from additional secure habitat and
be enhanced through wildlife management programs which could not be implemented without fee title ownership. The
development component has been carefully designed to minimize adverse environmental effects. Wintering bald eagles
will benefit from compensatory measures designed to enhance foraging opportunities. A net gain in wetlands will
be realized through successful implementation of mitigation measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the Preferred Alternative extends the protection of the environmental resources and maintenance
of environmental quality beyond what would be achieved under either of the other two alternatives. Alternative B
was not selected as the preferred alternative due to the significant impacts expected to resident bald eagles. Alternative
C, the No Action Alternative, was not selected as the preferred alternative because it would not result in the Service
increasing habitat protection within the Refuge.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1979, the U.S. Government declared the property known as South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon, to be excess to
the Federal inventory. In 1981, the State of Oregon contacted the Federal Government regarding a possible exchange
of property involving South Tongue Point and State-owned islands in the Columbia River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1989, the U.S. Navy contacted the Oregon Division of State Lands (Division) in regard to the possibility of homeporting
mine hunter coastal vessels at South Tongue Point. At the time, the Division was studying the feasibility of acquiring
South Tongue Point and developing the site as a marine industrial part in conjunction with the Federal Government's
proposal to exchange property with the State of Oregon. The Navy's interest led to the development of a master plan
for the marine industrial part at South Tongue Point, with the Navy as the first proposed tenant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GSA is proposing to convey approximately 130 acres of land at South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon (Section
12, T.8N., R.9W.), administered by the Corps to the State of Oregon. In exchange for the Federal land, the Division
is proposing to convey approximately 3,930 acres of State-owned land within the administrative boundary of Lewis
and Clark National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge), to GSA which will in turn transfer those lands to the Service. An additional
950 acres of State-owned land within the Refuge is proposed for Service management under a long-term cooperative
agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State is proposing to develop a multitenant shallow draft marine industrial park moorage facility for a variety
of water-dependent and general industrial uses. Water-dependent uses would have water access by means of pile-supported
piers. General industrial uses would be located in upland areas without water access.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This development activity is intended to create real property assets and associated income for the Common School
Fund of the State of Oregon, encourage new industrial employment within the area, and contribute to the economic stability
and employment diversification of Clatsop County and the State of Oregon. Under the proposed action, the Service
would gain fee title to lands within the administrative boundary of the Refuge. This would provide the Service with
the needed management flexibility to control future expected incompatible uses and enhance wildlife populations
and their habitats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping activities were undertaken preparatory to developing an EIS with a variety of Federal, State, and local entities.
A Notice of Intent to prepare the EIS was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 4, 1991. A Draft EIS was issued in June 1992. A Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 2, 1993. A Notice of Availability for the Final EIS was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 20, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Key Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through public scoping and with input from various agencies and publics, key issues were identified. These focused
on the following subject areas: (1) Certain aspects of the physical environment, especially the potential for hazardous
materials to be released from local sediments; (2) certain aspects of the biological environment, especially wetlands
and threatened and endangered species; and (3) certain aspects of the cultural and social environment, especially
the local and regional economy. These factors were also examined for the State-owned islands proposed as additions
to the Refuge. These issues were thoroughly examined in the Draft and Final EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
More than 20 alternatives were considered before limiting the alternatives to be advanced for further study. Alternatives
considered but not advanced for detailed analysis included alternative development concepts, alternative sites,
and single versus multi-tenant developments. Alternatives advanced for detailed analysis include (A) the proposed
land exchange and development of a multi-tenant marine industrial development; (B) the proposed land exchange and
multi-tenant marine industrial development with connecting road to North Tongue Point; and (C) a No Action Alternative.
Adverse and beneficial impacts of each alternative are considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative A comprises two elements: (1) the land exchange, and (2) the multi-tenant marine industrial development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Approximately 3,930 acres of State-owned land within the administrative boundary of the Lewis and Clark National
Wildlife Refuge would be exchanged through GSA to the Service for the 130 acres on South Tongue Point. The remaining
950 acres would be managed under a long-term cooperative agreement between the Division and the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Development of the multi-tenant marine industrial site would occur in two phases. Phase 1 would involve site infrastructure
developments and construction of marine industrial facilities. Construction would begin in 1994 and occur at a rate
supported by market conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative B
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative B comprises the same two elements as Alternative A with the addition, in Phase 2, of a road connecting South
Tongue Point to North Tongue Point. Construction of the connecting road would be dependent upon the need for additional
land to support marine industrial development and increased port activities at North Tongue Point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative C
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the No Action Alternative, South Tongue Point would remain in its present undeveloped condition except for the
existing Corps Field Station. There would be no land exchange. The No Action Alternative would not have direct adverse
impacts to the physical and biological environment. However, the No Action Alternative would not have direct economic
benefits from job creation and tax revenues.

decree in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Roy L. Merritt, et al., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. 94CV026, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first amended complaint filed by the United States seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties pursuant to Sections
1414(b) and 1431 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;3(b), and 300i, against Roy L. and Frances G. Merritt,
George Harold Parker, Jr., Linda K. Parker, and the trustee for debtor Roy L. Merritt for repeated and continuing violations
of national primary drinking water regulations, 40 CFR Part 141. The complaint alleges that drinking water supplied
to residents through the public drinking water system owned by Merritt's Mobile Manor exceeds maximum contamination
limitations for nitrate and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. Coli, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that sampling and reporting of the system was not conducted in accordance with applicable sections of 40 CFR part 141,
that neither the public or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was informed by the system operators of exceedances
of maximum contaminate limitations, and that the owners and operators of the public water system at Merritt's Mobile
Manor continued to operate the system in violation of administrative and emergency administrative orders issued
by EPA. The complaint seeks injunctive relief to compel defendants to operate the public water system in compliance
with the Act and its implementing regulations and civil penalties for violations of 40 CFR part 141 and administrative
orders issued by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this consent decree, four of the five named defendants agree to abide by the injunctive relief ordered by the
Court, provide safe alternative drinking water to residents of Merritt's Mobile Manor until municipal water and
sewer hookups can be installed, maintain septic systems in a manner so as to preclude further contamination to the
aquifer from sewage disposed by Merritt's Mobile Manor, and make payments in satisfaction of civil penalties for
violations of 40 CFR part 141 and administrative orders issued by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h) that a proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MCI Communications Corporation and BT Forty-Eight Company (``NewCo''), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. 94 1317(TFH). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration
of the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b)-(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that the proposed sale of 20% of the voting shares of MCI Communications Corporation (``MCI'')
to British Telecommunications plc (``BT''), and the proposed formation of a joint venture, presently known as BT
Forty-Eight Company (``NewCo''), between MCI and BT to provide certain international telecommunications services,
would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, in the markets for international telecommunications
services between the United States and the United Kingdom and for global seamless telecommunications services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment includes three categories of substantive obligations and restrictions. First, it requires
the defendants, MCI and NewCo, to disclose certain information about the telecommunications services that MCI and
NewCo receive from BT or provide together with BT. This ongoing disclosure is a precondition for MCI and NewCo to provide
international telecommunications services, including enhanced telecommunications and global seamless telecommunications
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the proposed Final Judgment prohibits MCI and NewCo from receiving from BT certain non-public and confidential
information provided to BT by other United States telecommunications service providers in connection with the arrangements
between such United States providers and BT to provide telecommunications services, including both international
correspondent relationships and interconnection with BT in the United Kingdom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed Final Judgment prohibits MCI and NewCo from providing telecommunications services or facilities
to BT to enable it to engage in the practice known as ``international simple resale'' from the United Kingdom to the
United States, which would involve bypassing existing correspondent relationships to send BT's traffic to the United
States, until two conditions are met. First, all qualified United States telecommunications services providers
that had applied for licenses in the United Kingdom to engage in international simple resale on or before December
1, 1993 must have been granted such licenses. Second, all such licensed providers must be afforded the opportunity
to interconnect with BT on standard, published and nondiscriminatory terms.

Stipulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is stipulated and agreed by and between the undersigned parties, by their respective attorneys, that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over each of the parties hereto and venue of
this action is proper in the District of Columbia. Defendants are hereby estopped from contesting the entry or enforceability
of the Final Judgment on the ground that the Court lacks venue or jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action
or over any defendant. For purposes of this stipulation defendant BT Forty-Eight Company, known as ``NewCo,'' and
any reference to NewCo herein, shall be understood to have the same meaning as the term ``NewCo'' in the attached proposed
Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The parties consent that a Final Judgment in the form hereto attached may be filed and entered by the Court, upon the
motion of any party or upon the Court's own motion, at any time after compliance with the requirements of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 16), and without further notice to any party or other proceedings, provided
that plaintiff has not withdrawn its consent. Plaintiff may withdraw its consent to entry of the Final Judgment at
any time before it is entered, by serving notice on the defendants and by filing that notice with the Court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Pending entry of the Final Judgment, defendants shall abide by and comply with the provisions of the Final Judgment
following consummation of the Amended and Restated Investment Agreement dated January 31, 1994 (and related agreements)
or any similar arrangement between any defendant and British Telecommunications plc (``BT''). This obligation
shall not be affected by the timing of execution of any agreements between defendants and BT requiring BT to provide
to MCI and NewCo information needed for compliance with the requirements of Sections II.A.1&hyph;6. Such agreements,
which shall be executed prior to the entry of the Final Judgment, shall be consistent with Sections II.B&hyph;D of
the Final Judgment and shall be provided to the Department of Justice upon execution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agreements governing disclosure to United States corporations, referred to in Section IV.E of the Final Judgment,
will provide that: (1) Non-public information received from the Department of Justice is intended for use to complain
or provide information to any government authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom, and to identify and
evaluate internally any conduct that may be made the subject of such a complaint or provision of information, but may
not be used for the sale or marketing of the corporation's services; (2) such information may not be disclosed to persons
other than officers, directors, employees, agents, or contractors of the corporation and to government authorities
in the United States or the United Kingdom (including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission
and OFTEL); (3) all persons to whom the information is disclosed will be advised of the limitations on use and disclosure
of the information; and (4) if unauthorized use or disclosure occurs, the Department of Justice can revoke or otherwise
limit the corporation's further access to such information, unless the Department decides, in its sole discretion,
that revocation of access is inappropriate. Plaintiff, in its discretion, may add further conditions to such agreements.
Any actions taken by the Department to redress unauthorized use or disclosure will not diminish or create any ability
in NewCo or MCI to pursue separately against persons receiving such information from the Department any legal remedies
for unauthorized use or disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Plaintiff and defendants are presently aware that the entities listed in Attachment A to this Stipulation are,
or based upon the best available information appear to be, qualified United States international telecommunications
providers as defined in Section II.E of the Final Judgment. Any other persons (including corporations or other legal
entities) that make known to the Department of Justice before the entry of the Final Judgment that they meet the standards
for qualification under Section II.E of the Final Judgment shall be added to Attachment A of this Stipulation if the
Department concludes that such persons are qualified United States international telecommunications providers
within the meaning of Section II.E. The Department shall publish the names of such persons in its response to public
comments under the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Six months prior to the expiration of the Final Judgment, defendants shall inform the Department of Justice in writing
whether they will continue or discontinue the operation of NewCo beyond the term of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In the event plaintiff withdraws its consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment or if the proposed Final Judgment
is not entered pursuant to this Stipulation, this Stipulation shall be of no effect whatsoever and its making shall
be without prejudice to any party in this or any other proceeding, except that if the Court decides not to enter the Final
Judgment, and the defendants and British Telecommunications plc have consummated pursuant to paragraph 3 of this
Stipulation, defendants shall abide by and comply with the terms of the Final Judgment until the conclusion of this
action, unless the parties otherwise agree or the Court otherwise orders.

And whereas, plaintiff and defendants, by their respective attorneys, have consented to the entry of this Final Judgment

And whereas, defendants have further consented after any consummation as defined in the Stipulation entered into

``Qualified United States international telecommunications providers,'' for purposes of this Section II.E, shall
mean all United States international telecommunications providers as of December 1, 1993, except for any provider

meet the requirements for a license to provide international simple resale, so long as such requirements are applicable
to all persons that seek to provide international simple resale between the United Kingdom and the United States,
(c) has, in the judgment of the plaintiff, absent any finding by United Kingdom government authorities, failed to
pursue effectively its license application, (d) has voluntarily modified its license application after December

offered a license that would allow it to commence providing international simple resale between the United States
and the United Kingdom and has not accepted such license; or (f) has failed, after the grant of a license, to supply promptly
an adequate statement of the necessary information required for interconnection. A list of the entities that plaintiff
the United States and defendants presently understand to be qualified under this Section II.E is included in the Stipulation

``Convey'' and ``conveyance'' include transmission, switching, and receiving, and cognate expressions shall
be construed accordingly. A telecommunications service includes all facilities used in providing such service,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jurisdiction is retained by this Court for the purposes of enabling any of the parties to this Final Judgment to apply

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any party to this Final Judgment may seek modification of its substantive terms and obligations, and other parties
to the Final Judgment shall have an opportunity to respond to such a motion. If the motion is contested by another party,
it shall only be granted if the movant makes a clear showing that (i) a significant change in circumstances or significant
new event subsequent to the entry of the Final Judgment requires modification of the Final Judgment to avoid substantial
harm to competition or consumers in the United States, or to avoid substantial hardship to defendants, and (ii) the
proposed modification is (a) in the public interest, (b) suitably tailored to the changed circumstances or new events
and would not result in serious hardship to any defendant, and (c) consistent with the purposes of the antitrust laws
of the United States and with the telecommunications regulatory regime of the United Kingdom. Neither the absence
of specific reference to a particular event in the Final Judgment nor the foreseeability of such an event at the time
this Final Judgment was entered, shall preclude this Court's consideration of any modification request. This standard
for obtaining contested modifications shall not require the United States to initiate a separate antitrust action
before seeking modifications. The same standard shall apply to any party seeking modification of this Final Judgment.
If a motion to modify this Final Judgment is not contested by any party, it shall be granted if the proposed modification
is within the reaches of the public interest. Where modifications of the Final Judgment are sought, the provisions
of Section V of this Final Judgment may be invoked to obtain any information or documents needed to evaluate the proposed
modification prior to decision by the Court.

The United States, pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA'' or ``Tunney Act''),
15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h), files this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted

Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On June 15, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 25, alleging that the proposed acquisition of a 20% equity interest in MCI Communications Corporation (``MCI'')
by British Telecommunications plc (``BT''), and the proposed formation of a joint venture between MCI and BT to provide
international enhanced telecommunications services, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15
U.S.C. 18, by lessening competition in the markets for international telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom and for global seamless telecommunications services, thereby depriving United States
consumers of the benefits of competition_lower prices and higher quality services. Defendants are MCI and BT Forty-Eight
Company, also known as NewCo, which at present is a wholly owned subsidiary of BT and which will become the joint venture
of MCI and BT upon consummation of the agreements between them. The Complaint seeks injunctive and other relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States and the defendants have stipulated to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment, after compliance with
the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h). Entry of the proposed Final Judgment would
terminate this action, except that the Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, and enforce the proposed
Final Judgment and to punish violations of the Judgment. The United States and the defendants also have stipulated
that the defendants will abide by the terms of the proposed Final Judgment after consummation of the transactions
between them, pending entry of the Final Judgment by the Court, permitting the transactions to go forward prior to
completion of the Tunney Act procedures. Should the Court decline to enter the Final Judgment, defendants have also
committed in the stipulation to abide by its terms until the conclusion of this action.

A. The Proposed Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On August 4, 1993, MCI and BT entered into an Investment Agreement by which BT would acquire a 20% equity stake in MCI
for approximately $4.3 billion. MCI and BT entered into an amended and restated version of this Investment Agreement
on January 31, 1994. With consummation of this Investment Agreement and related agreements, BT would become the single
largest shareholder in MCI. In addition, BT would receive a number of special shareholder rights, including the need
for BT's consent to various actions by MCI, access to internal MCI information, and proportionate board representation
consisting of three of the fifteen seats on MCI's Board of Directors. MCI would gain certain special rights with respect
to BT as well, including a seat on the BT Board of Directors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCI and BT have agreed that if either party competes with the other in its ``core'' business (defined to include any
telecommunications services or equipment, with specific limited exceptions) in its assigned territory (the ``Americas''
for MCI, and the rest of the world for BT), it will lose all special rights, including board membership.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 While the agreement does not formally prohibit BT and MCI from competing with each other in their domestic and international
telecommunications businesses, as a practical matter it ensures that BT will only enter the United States telecommunications
markets through its investment in MCI so long as their relationship continues. BT's operations in the United States
principally consist of Syncordia, a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in ``global outsourcing.'' This is the provision
of various integrated international telecommunications services and enhanced services to large users through
a single source, allowing customers to transfer responsibility for owning and managing their corporate telecommunications
networks.

Pursuant to agreement with the competition authorities of the Commission of the European Union, the restriction
on MCI entering BT's core business in its territory has been limited to a period of five years from closing, but the duration

BT and MCI had a more significant competitive overlap in the United States at the time that they entered into the Investment
Agreement, in the area of public data networks. BT's subsidiary British Telecommunications North America (BTNA)
owned the Tymnet public data network, a major provider of such services, while MCI owned 25% of Infonet, one of Tymnet's
principal competitors. MCI agreed to acquire Tymnet from BT. Before it consummated this acquisition earlier in 1994,
however, MCI sold its share in Infonet to the other owners of Infonet.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
While they entered into the Investment Agreement, MCI and BT also entered into a Joint Venture Agreement and other
related agreements committing them to form a joint venture, to be owned 75.1% by BT and 24.9% of MCI. This joint venture,
NewCo, is incorporated in the United Kingdom, and will have its principal place of business and most of its employees
in the United States. BT and MCI both will contribute international telecommunications facilities to the joint venture,
including BT's Syncordia business. The stated purpose of the joint venture is to provide international enhanced
telecommunications services to large international users, such as multinational corporations. These services
will be available from a single source and will be consistent in quality, features and capabilities wherever purchased.
These services may include various types of data services, messaging and video conferencing, global calling card
services, intelligent network services, certain types of satellite services and global outsourcing such as Syncordia
already offers in the United States and other countries. Under certain circumstances, and if permitted by regulatory
authorities, the role of the joint venture may be expanded to include other telecommunications services in addition
to enhanced ones. The venture may also expand its business operations to other types of customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCI will be the exclusive distributor of the joint venture's services in North and South America and the Caribbean
(``the Americas''), and BT will be the joint venture's exclusive distributor in the rest of the world. MCI and BT also
have agreed to supply the necessary services and facilities in their respective distribution regions to enable the
joint venture to operate. In addition, MCI and BT have agreed not to compete with the joint venture anywhere in the world.
Therefore, BT and MCI will have to realize all gains from the areas of business in which the joint venture is engaged
through their ownership interests in the joint venture and their sales of its services, and BT generally will only
be able to participate in this market in the United States through its investments in MCI and the joint venture.

There is a limited possibility for so-called ``passive sales,'' that is, sales by BT or MCI to a customer with no presence

but has not been solicited by that firm.

B. The Parties to the Transaction and the Relevant Markets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MCI is the second largest long distance telecommunications carrier in the United States, and in terms of traffic,
the fifth largest telecommunications carrier in the world. Its principal long distance domestic and international
competitors in the United States are AT&amp;T Corporation, the largest carrier, and Sprint Corporation, the third
largest carrier. BT, formerly a government-owned monopoly, is now privately held. It is by far the largest telecommunications
carrier in the United Kingdom, and is the fourth largest telecommunications carrier in the world in terms of traffic.
BT is the dominant telecommunications carrier in the United Kingdom, as it provides almost all local services and
had high market shares in long distance domestic and international services. Indeed, BT has over ten times the total
sales revenues of Mercury Communications Ltd., its only substantial competitor in long distance services. Thus,
the transactions between MCI and BT will result in vertical affiliation between the dominant telecommunications
carrier in the United Kingdom and the second largest long distance provider in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both MCI and BT provide international telecommunications and enhanced telecommunications services between the
United States and the United Kingdom to individuals and businesses for the exchange of voice, video, and data messages.
MCI carries about 20% of the international switched telecommunications traffic originating and terminating in
the United States and BT carries about 75% of the international switched telecommunications traffic originating
and terminating in the United Kingdom. Mercury is the only other company the United Kingdom currently permitted to
provide international telecommunications services between the United States and United Kingdom using its own telecommunications
facilities (there is also some limited resale of the services of BT and Mercury). No other companies have been licensed
in the United Kingdom to provide international telecommunications systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BT has substantial market power in the provision of telecommunications services in and to the United Kingdom, in large
part because access to its local network is necessary for all other telephone companies that seek to provide long distance
domestic and international services. About 97% of all telecommunications traffic in the United Kingdom terminates
through BT's local network, and the great majority of traffic also originates on BT's network. Although cable television
companies provide local telecommunications services in some areas of the United Kingdom, today they account for
an insignificant proportion of such services, in the range of 1%, and their activities are unlikely to diminish BT's
market power during the term of the proposed decree.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Substantial replication of BT's local telecommunications network in the United Kingdom would be prohibitively
expensive for any new entrant or existing long distance provider.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
In addition to BT and the cable companies, there is one other provider of local telecommunications services in the
United Kingdom, serving only the city of Kingston-upon-Hull where BT does not have a local network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BT also controls the largest and most comprehensive long distance domestic and international telecommunications
network in the United Kingdom, and carries about 84% of domestic switched long distance traffic in the United Kingdom.
(Mercury carries virtually all of the rest.) Since 1991, the United Kingdom government has granted additional licenses
for domestic telecommunications systems. Those new domestic licensees either have not yet begun commercial long
distance operations using their own facilities (some firms operate on a limited scale as resellers using the facilities
of BT or Mercury), or have not yet achieved any substantial share of the United Kingdom market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BT has been able to retain a dominant position in the provision of long distance domestic and international telecommunications
services in the United Kingdom for several reasons, including its control of the local network. BT does not provide
Mercury or other competitors either equal access or number portability. Both of these features are generally offered
to all long distance carriers by operators of the monopoly local exchange networks in the United States, and have been
important factors in the development of domestic and international long distance competition. Equal access would
allow customers to gain access to the long distance networks of Mercury and other competitors through BT's network
without dailing additional numbers or obtaining special equipment that is not needed to use BT's long distanced services.
Number portability would allow customers switching from BT to Mercury or other competitors to retain their original
telephone number. The lack of equal access and number portability places Mercury and any other competitors who may
offer long distance service at a competitive disadvantage to BT, contributing to BT's ability to sustain its substantial
market power in the provision of long distance domestic and international telecommunications services in the United
Kingdom. These long distance services are necessary to deliver enhanced telecommunications and seamless global
telecommunications services internationally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Mercury must pay BT Access Deficit Charges (``ADCs'') in order to have traffic delivered through BT's
network. ADCs are payments made by competing carriers to BT for each minute of traffic those carriers send through
BT's network. ADCs are intended by United Kingdom regulatory authorities to compensate BT for providing its other
local exchange services subject to price controls. These charges, especially for international traffic, greatly
exceed BT's cost of providing interconnection to Mercury. ADCs may be imposed on new entrants that compete with BT
and interconnect with its network. The total cost for Mercury, or any other United Kingdom competitor of BT that is
required to pay ADCs, to send international traffic through BT's local network is several times greater than the comparable
costs paid by international long distance carriers in the United States for interconnection with local networks.

C. The Competitive Effect of the Acquisition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Complaint alleges that the acquisition of MCI shares by BT may substantially lessen competition in the provision
of international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom. BT will have increased
incentives and the ability, using its dominant position in the United Kingdom, to favor MCI and to disfavor its United
States competitors in international telecommunications services in various ways, making competitors' offerings
less attractive in quality and price than those of MCI, and so lessening the ability of MCI's rivals to compete effectively
in these services. As a result of this anticompetitive conduct, the price of international telecommunications services
to the United Kingdom available to United States consumers could be increased, and the quality lessened, relative
to what United States consumers would pay and receive in a competitive market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International telecommunications services are generally provided today on a ``correspondent'' basis, meaning
that providers in different countries enter into commercially negotiated bilateral agreements with one another
to complete each other's traffic. International correspondent telecommunications services primarily consist
of the basic switched voice telephone call, which is known either as International Direct Dial (``IDD'') or International
Message Telephone Service (``IMTS''), and International Private Line Service (``IPLS''). They also include certain
other switched telecommunications and enhanced telecommunications services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Switched'' traffic makes use of switching facilities and common lines. Consumers typically obtain switched correspondent
services from the provider in the country where a call originates, and calls are handed off to the provider in the other
country without direct customer involvement. IPLS consists of circuits dedicated to the use of a single customer,
and the providers of IPLS in each country typically sell their ``half'' of the circuit to the user separately. Switched
services constitute the great majority of international telecommunications services in terms of both traffic and
revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that acquiring a 20% ownership interest in MCI will increase BT's incentive to discriminate
in favor of MCI and against other United States international carriers in the market or markets for international
telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom. BT's incentive to favor MCI is reinforced
by the provision in the Investment Agreement that subjects BT to loss of its special rights if it competes in the Americas
in the provision of telecommunications services and equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCI could receive various forms of favorable treatment from BT with respect to its international correspondent services
between the United States and the United Kingdom. For example, BT could favor MCI or disfavor its competitors with
respect to the prices, terms and conditions on which international services are provided, as well as the quality of
provisioning of those services, and could provide to MCI advance information about planned changes to its network.
Such discrimination could place other United States international carriers at a competitive disadvantage to MCI,
enabling MCI to charge more for its services or to provide a lower quality of service than it would otherwise be able
to do without losing customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Complaint alleges that BT's ownership interest in MCI would increase BT's incentive to provide MCI
confidential, competitively sensitive information that BT obtains from other United States carriers through their
correspondent relationships with BT. In order to use BT's correspondent switched and private line services and to
negotiate terms of use, United States international telecommunications providers must provide BT various types
of competitively sensitive information, including private line customer identities, service requirements, plans
for the introduction of new services, changes in existing services, and future traffic projections. If BT were to
share this information with MCI, then MCI could gain an anticompetitive advantage over its United States competitors.
Allowing MCI access to such competitively valuable information about its competitors would also increase the risk
of collusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Complaint alleges that the agreements will give BT the increased incentive and ability to send its international
switched traffic to the United States exclusively or largely to MCI. Such diversion of traffic could harm competition
among international telecommunications service providers in the United States, and United States consumers, by
increasing the net settlement payments that other United States carriers must make to BT.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 If BT diverted all or most of its traffic to MCI, unaffiliated United States international carriers would lose offsetting
return traffic from BT and would have to make larger settlement payments to BT, putting them at a competitive disadvantage
in the market for United States-United Kingdom telecommunications, and this could result in MCI charging higher
prices. The ability to divert the bulk of its traffic to an affiliated United States carrier could also give BT an increased
incentive to keep international accounting rates above costs.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
The correspondent agreements governing switched services establish an ``accounting rate'' per minute of traffic,
for each type of traffic sent over a particular international route. The carriers in each country pay half the accounting
rate (the ``settlement rate'') to their foreign correspondents for each minute of traffic completed. Settlement
payments for outgoing traffic are offset by the settlement payments for incoming traffic. When there is an imbalance
in the amount of outgoing and incoming traffic between carriers, the carrier with the most outgoing traffic makes
a net settlement payment to its correspondent. Today, United States carriers accept the same proportion of the total
switched traffic from each of their correspondents in a foreign country as the proportion of total switched traffic
to the correspondent that each of the United States carriers send. This protects each carrier from being competitively
disadvantaged by having to make large net settlement payments that other competitors can avoid. Federal Communications
Commission policy supports this proportionate allocation of switched traffic, although the FCC has not adopted
regulations governing proportionate allocation.

Because United States carriers send substantially more traffic to the United Kingdom than United Kingdom carriers
send to the United States, United States carriers must make large net settlement payments to United Kingdom carriers,
most of which go to BT. Current accounting rates between the United States and the United Kingdom are substantially
above the cost of providing service.

D. The Competitive Effect of the Joint Venture
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Complaint also alleges that the formation of the BT&hyph;MCI joint venture may substantially lessen competition
in the market or markets for seamless global telecommunications services provided in the United States. BT will have
increased incentives and the ability, using its dominant position in the United Kingdom, to favor NewCo and MCI and
to disfavor their United States competitors in seamless global telecommunications services in various ways, lessening
the ability of the competitors of MCI and NewCo to develop and offer new seamless global services and compete effectively
in these services. As a result of this anticompetitive conduct, the quality of seamless global telecommunications
services available to United States consumers could be lessened, and the price increased, relative to what United
States consumers would pay and receive in a competitive market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seamless global telecommunications services would be made available by a single provider using an integrated international
network of owned or leased facilities, and would have the same quality, features, characteristics, and capabilities
wherever they are provided, making them significantly superior to ordinary correspondent telecommunications
services for many customers, particularly multinational corporations and other large users of international telecommunications.
Seamless services would permit one-stop shopping, so that users could avoid negotiation with telecommunications
network operators in different countries, and would overcome the inadequacies and differences in standards in various
national telecommunications systems. They could offer scale economies by comparison with private networks individually
organized by users. However, creating seamless global networks will require a major commitment of resources and
expertise that few firms can supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seamless global telecommunications services represent an emerging market, but an important one for the evolution
of international telecommunications. Other entrants or potential entrants in this market, in addition to BT and
MCI, include AT&amp;T's Worldsource (a non-exclusive partnership with several foreign providers including Japan's
KDD), Unisource (an alliance of the national or principal telecommunications providers in Switzerland, Sweden
and the Netherlands), Eunetcom (an alliance of the German and French national telecommunications providers), Sprint,
and Cable &amp; Wireless plc (the parent of Mercury).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By their nature, seamless global telecommunications services must be offered on a consistent basis in all the major
countries where customers are located. Thus, nondiscriminatory access to the telecommunications networks in these
countries is essential for any provider of these services. The United Kingdom has a crucial role in seamless global
telecommunications services because about ten percent of all likely potential customers have their headquarters
there, and most potential customers of these services need telecommunications services in the United Kingdom.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BT's role in the joint venture would increase its incentive to favor the joint venture and MCI over other United States
providers of seamless global telecommunications services. Since BT could not compete with the joint venture and
only MCI could solicit customers for the joint venture's services in the United States, where about 40 percent of all
potential customers have their headquarters, BT would depend on MCI and NewCo for revenues from such services in the
United States. It would not have the opportunity to earn additional revenues in non-exclusive arrangements to provide
similar services with other providers, so its incentive to use its dominant position in the United Kingdom to place
MCI and NewCo in the strongest possible position in the United States, at the expense of competitors, would be reinforced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BT could discriminate in favor of NewCo and MCI using its vertically integrated position in the United Kingdom, with
a virtual monopoly in local services and a dominant position in long distance domestic and international services,
as these services will be needed by competing providers of seamless global services to complete traffic. Discrimination
could occur in interconnection to the BT network, provision of information about the network, and provision of the
international private circuits NewCo and its competitors would need for their seamless global service ``platforms.''
BT could also provide NewCo and MCI with competitively sensitive information it obtains from seamless global service
competitors who interconnect with BT's United Kingdom network. Finally, BT could favor MCI and NewCo by sending them
on a non-correspondent basis traffic from the United Kingdom that would otherwise be allocated proportionately.
The agreements between BT and MCI specifically provide for such use of NewCo facilities.

Section II contains the substantive restrictions and obligations. They include transparency requirements (Section
II.A), confidentiality requirements (Sections II.B, II.C and II.D), and requirements related to international
simple resale (Section II.E). These various requirements, in combination, will substantially diminish the risk
of abuse of BT's market power to discriminate or otherwise afford anticompetitive advantages to MCI and NewCo.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 They will do so by making discrimination easier to detect, by precluding the misuse of confidential information obtained
by BT from MCI's competitors, and by increasing the likelihood that United States competitors of MCI and NewCo, if
licensed, will be interconnected with BT in the United Kingdom, so that they can respond effectively to international
discrimination and diversion of BT's traffic to MCI. The object of these substantive terms is to ensure that MCI, as
the result of its direct affiliation with BT or its position as the exclusive distributor of NewCo services in the United
States, is not advantaged over its competitors in the United States to the detriment of competition or consumers.

1. Transparency Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section II.A forbids MCI and NewCo from offering, supplying distributing or otherwise providing any telecommunications
or enhanced telecommunications service that makes use of telecommunications services provided by BT in the United
Kingdom or between the United States and the United Kingdom, unless MCI and NewCo disclose certain types of information.
Because these transparency requirements may be affected by changes in regulation or other circumstances, Section
II.A provides the United States with the ability to waive these requirements in whole or in part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Section IV.E., MCI and NewCo will provide the information to the Department of Justice, which may then
disclose the information to any United States corporation that holds or has applied for a license, from either United
States or United Kingdom authorities, to provide international telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom. This will enable the principal competitors of MCI and NewCo to monitor whether either
of these companies is receiving discriminatory treatment in their favor from BT, and provide them with evidence that
could be used to make a complaint to any governmental authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom. The term
``governmental authorities'' is used broadly and includes independent agencies. Corporations receiving this
information from the Department of Justice would be required to sign a confidentiality agreement with the Department,
obligating them not to disclose non-public information to any persons other than governmental authorities. The
stipulation between the defendants and the United States describes the form of a confidentiality agreement in more
detail. This confidentiality provision was adopted to prevent to wider dissemination of defendants' non-public
business information than is necessary to detect and prevent anticompetitive conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defendants also have stipulated to enter into agreements with BT, prior to entry of the Final Judgment, that will ensure
that they are provided with sufficient information to comply with Section II.A. Such agreements with BT must also
be consistent with the separate obligations on defendants, under Sections II.B&hyph;D, precluding receipt from
BT of various types of information about their competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``Telecommunications services'' and ``enhanced telecommunications services'' are employed throughout
the transparency requirements as well as elsewhere in the Final Judgment.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 ``Telecommunications services,'' as defined in the Final Judgment (see Section IV.L), include ordinary switched
voice telephony and private circuits as well as conveyance (including transmission, switching and receiving) of
data and video information, and signaling, translation and conversion in the network. These basic telecommunications
services are the bulk of existing telecommunications, and are licensed and regulated to some degree in both the United
States and the United Kingdom. There are relatively few significant providers. In contrast, ``enhanced telecommunications
services'' (as defined in Section IV.F), which use telecommunications services as a foundation to provide various
advanced and intelligent applications of additional value to users, are subject to little or no regulation in the
United States and the United Kingdom. The number of providers is often greater than for basic telecommunications,
although all such providers must have access to the basic telecommunications services in order to do business.

The definitions of ``telecommunications services'' and ``enhanced telecommunications services'' in the Final
Judgment are based on the distinction between basic services and enhanced services recognized by the FCC, as well
as similar concepts in the United Kingdom (where ``value-added services'' is analogous to enhanced services). The
definitions do not duplicate those used by the national regulatory authorities, which differ somewhat in terminology,
but they incorporate as much as possible the underlying concepts, while ensuring consistent treatment within the
context of this judgment for services offered in the United States and in the United Kingdom.

or something other than a telecommunications service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NewCo will interconnect directly with BT's United Kingdom network, and will obtain other telecommunications services
from BT, such as international circuits, to use in the provision of seamless global network services. NewCo's services
may be distributed by BT either alone or together with BT's own domestic services in the United Kingdom. NewCo may have
access to valuable information concerning changes to BT's United Kingdom network that has not yet been disclosed
to other competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, NewCo is subject to four categories of disclosure requirements. Section II.A.1 obligates it to disclose
the prices, terms and conditions, including any discounts, on which telecommunications services are provided to
NewCo pursuant to interconnection agreements. Interconnection agreements are specific arrangements (see Section
IV.H) by which other licensed operators in the United Kingdom receive rights to connect their systems to BT's network
and have BT complete delivery of traffic, on terms that may differ from those available to retail customers. Although
BT began to publish new interconnection agreements last year, BT's license allows it the option to publish pricing
methodologies instead of actual prices. Section II.A.1 will compel NewCo to disclose the actual prices BT charges
it for interconnection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II.A.2 imposes similar disclosure obligations on NewCo for prices, terms and conditions, including any
discounts, of any other telecommunications services it obtains from BT. These services could include international
private circuits obtained at retail or otherwise from BT. The disclosure requirements under this provision also
apply to the terms on which BT provides U.K. telecommunications services to customers together with NewCo services,
thus facilitating detection of discrimination in bundling of services. To some extent these types of information
are already disclosed by BT in its retail tariffs pursuant to United Kingdom regulation, but Section II.A.2 ensures
comprehensive transparency to prevent discrimination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II.A.4 requires NewCo to provide additional information about the specific telecommunications services
that it receives from BT to supply telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom, as well as the services BT provides directly to customers in the United Kingdom as the
distributor for NewCo. NewCo is required to disclose the types of circuits, including their capacity, and other telecommunications
services provided. NewCo also is required to disclose information concerning the actual average times between order
and delivery of circuits and the number of outages and actual average times between fault report and restoration for
various categories of circuits. These types of information are not otherwise disclosed under existing regulations,
and are important to the detection of various types of discrimination. Where NewCo has to disclose particular telecommunications
services provided by BT under II.A., it is required to identify the services and provide reasonable detail about them
(if not already published). However, if a service is sold as a unit, separate underlying facilities need only be disclosed
to the extent necessary to identify the service and the means of interconnection. NewCo is not required to identify
individual customers or the locations of circuits and services dedicated to particular customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under Section II.A.6 NewCo is required to disclose information it or MCI receives from BT about planned and
authorized changes in BT's United Kingdom network that would affect interconnection arrangements with any licensed
operators. Should MCI receive information separately from NewCo, it has the same disclosure obligation. Disclosure
of information of this nature is important to ensure that NewCo, through its affiliation with BT, is not given commercial
advantages through advance notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCI's relationship with BT in the provision of international services will be less complex than NewCo's, owing to
MCI's agreements not to compete with NewCo and to suffer loss of its special rights if it competes with BT outside the
Americas for a period of five years from closing. MCI will continue to provide international correspondent switched
and private line services together with BT. To ensure greater transparency in MCI's dealings with BT, Section II.A
contains two sets of disclosure obligations specifically applicable to MCI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II.A.3 applies to any international switched telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications services
provided by MCI and BT on a correspondent basis between the United States and the United Kingdom. It requires MCI to
disclose both the accounting and settlement rates, and other terms and conditions, applicable to any of these services.
When there is no specific agreement between MCI and BT setting forth this information, MCI must state the rates, terms
and conditions on which the service is actually provided. If BT combines types of traffic subject to different accounting
rates to determine the proportionate allocation of switched traffic to United States providers, MCI must disclose
its own minutes of traffic in each separate accounting rate category so that the other United States providers can
determine whether they are being sent the appropriate shares of traffic from BT, if they do not already receive data
(such as total traffic volumes in each rate category) that is sufficient to enable them to do so. This latter obligation
addresses a particular type of possible discrimination in international services, known as ``grooming,'' by which
a foreign carrier can favor particular United States correspondents with traffic of superior value while appearing
to allocate minutes of traffic on a proportionate basis. Today some types of information covered by Section II.A.3,
such as agreed-upon accounting rates, are supplied to the Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') and are published,
or are provided to competitors. Where information has already been made available in these ways, Section II.A.3 of
the Final Judgment does not require MCI to provide it to the Department of Justice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II.A.5 requires MCI to provide information about the United States-United Kingdom international private
circuits it provides jointly with BT. MCI must disclose the actual average times between order and delivery by BT,
and the actual average time intervals between fault report and restoration in specific areas of the international
facility and the overseas network. This information is similar to types of information NewCo provides under Section
II.A.4 and serves similar purposes. MCI is also required, for circuits used to provide international switched services
on a correspondent basis between the United States and the United Kingdom, to identify average numbers of circuit
equivalents available during the busy hour. The great majority of these circuits would be with BT. None of the information
disclosed under Section II.A.5 is made public today.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section II.A., MCI and NewCo are required to disclose intellectual property or proprietary information only
if it is one of the types of information expressly required to be disclosed by any of these transparency obligations,
or if it is necessary for licensed operators to interconnect with BT's United Kingdom network or for United States
international providers to use BT's international facilities to complete their services. MCI and NewCo, as well
as BT indirectly, are thus protected against overly broad disclosure of such valuable commercial information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Three provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, Sections II.B, II.C and II.D, constrain the ability of MCI (including
the director it appoints to the BT board) and NewCo to receive from BT (including BT-appointed directors on the board
of MCI), various types of confidential information that BT obtains from MCI's and NewCo's United States competitors.
Existing regulatory requirements do not adequately protect any of this information from disclosure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under Section II.B MCI and NewCo will not receive information from BT that other United States competitors identify
as proprietary and maintain as confidential, but that has been obtained by BT as the result of its provision of interconnection
or other telecommunications services to the competitors in the United Kingdom. In order to obtain interconnection,
other licensed operators are commonly required to provide BT with a statement of requirements containing detailed
information about their planned services and interconnection needs. As interconnection needs change over time,
BT will receive more confidential information. BT may also learn the identities and service needs of particular customers
of its competitors who need to have private circuits interconnected with BT. Of course, there is no alternative to
interconnection with BT because of its local monopoly bottleneck and overall market power in the United Kingdom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II.C similarly forbids MCI and NewCo from receiving confidential, non-public information from BT that BT
may obtain from other United States competitors of MCI and NewCo through its correspondent relationships with them.
United States international telecommunications providers have no reasonable alternative at present to using BT
for at least some of their correspondent traffic to and from the United Kingdom. A limited exception is provided to
allow MCI to obtain certain types of aggregate information it may need to comply with its transparency obligations
under Sections II.A.3(ii) and II.A.5, but in no circumstances may MCI use this exception to receive individual information
about other providers that is otherwise prohibited by this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Section II.D. addresses a specific competitive risk in the context of international correspondent relationships,
by prohibiting MCI from seeking or accepting from BT any non-public information about the future prices or pricing
plans of any competitor of MCI in the provision of international telecommunications services between the United
States and United Kingdom. BT and its United States correspondents, in the course of accounting rate negotiations,
exchange considerable information including business plans and traffic projections. Section II.D addresses the
substantial risk of violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act that would arise if BT were to obtain non-public pricing
information from MCI's competitors once BT becomes MCI's single largest owner, by precluding any sharing of price
information through BT. Risks of price collusion, tacit or explicit, are considerable in an industry with a small
number of large providers offering similar types of services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. International Simple Resale Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The international simple resale provision of the proposed Final Judgment, Section II.E, is directed at actions by
BT, using its dominant position in the United Kingdom, that would discriminate in favor of MCI, including the diversion
of most or all of BT's traffic from the United Kingdom through MCI and NewCo. Such conduct could raise prices to United
States consumers or otherwise harm competition in the United States, unless United States carriers are licensed
to operate in the United Kingdom and interconnected with BT so that they can respond effectively to BT's conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International simple resale (``ISR'') (see Section IV.I) is the transmission through private or leased international
telecommunications facilities (or by any other international means where usage is not measured) of voice or data
traffic (excluding certain enhanced capabilities), if that traffic is carried over the public switched telecommunications
network in both the country where it originates and the country where it terminates. ISR avoids the correspondent
system, and traffic sent by ISR would be exempt from proportionate allocation policies. When all providers on an international
route are equally capable of using ISR, it can lessen the risk of discriminatory practices in switched correspondent
services, and can enable United States providers to retaliate against attempts by a foreign carrier to use its market
power to increase the settlement liabilities of unaffiliated carriers relative to those of its United States affiliate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISR between the United States and the United Kingdom can lawfully occur only when the telecommunications regulatory
authorities of both countries find generally that equivalency exists between them in policies relating to open entry
and non-discrimination. However, that equivalency finding will not be sufficient for all United States providers
to begin offering ISR to the United Kingdom, because in the United Kingdom each provider of international simple resale
services must also be individually licensed. To provide ISR, a firm must have the ability to use international facilities
and interconnections to the domestic networks at both ends of the international route.

Section II.E prohibits MCI and NewCo from providing any telecommunications facilities or services to be used by BT
for international simple resale between the United Kingdom and the United States, until (1) All qualified United
States international telecommunications providers that applied by December 1, 1993 for United Kingdom licenses
that would allow them to provide ISR have been granted ISR licenses,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and (2) all such licensed United States providers have been offered the opportunity to interconnect with BT's United
Kingdom network on standard, nondiscriminatory and published terms, with reasonable arrangements for any other
necessary technical aspects of interconnection. This provision does not compel or direct the grant of any licenses,
which is the prerogative of the United Kingdom government. It ensures, however, that any delays in licensing competing
United States providers, or delays on BT's part in interconnecting such licensed providers in the United Kingdom,
will not be used to anticompetitive effect by MCI, NewCo and BT.

Section VII, the modifications provision, affords the means of expanding, altering or reducing the substantive

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where a proposed modification is contested by any party to the Final Judgment, the Court must determine both whether
modification is required, and whether the particular modification proposed is appropriate. The United States is
able to seek changes to the substantive terms and obligations of the Final Judgment from the Court, including additional
requirements to prevent receipt of discriminatory treatment by defendants, in order to avoid substantial harm to
competition or consumers in the United States. The defendants are able to seek modifications removing obligations
of the Final Judgment in order to avoid substantial hardship to themselves. In either case, the party seeking modifications
must make a clear showing that modification is required, based on a significant change in circumstances or a significant
new event subsequent to the entry of the Final Judgment. Such a change in circumstances or an event subsequent to the
entry of judgment need not have been unforeseen, nor need it have been referred to in the Final Judgment. The parties
recognize that discrimination of a significant nature involving BT and defendants, subsequent to the entry of the
Final Judgment, could constitute such a new event. Before concluding that discrimination against any particular
competitor of MCI or NewCo required seeking a modification of the Final Judgment to protect competition or consumers,
the Department of Justice would ordinarily inquire at the outset whether the injured competitor had availed itself
of existing regulatory remedies, if any, in the United Kingdom as well as the United States, and what relief had been
provided or action taken, if any, by the telecommunications regulatory agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Court concludes that any party has met its burden of showing that the Final Judgment should be modified over the
opposition of another party, it would then be empowered to grant any particular modification that meets three criteria.
The modification must be (i) in the public interest, (ii) suitably tailored to the changed circumstances or new event
that gave rise to its adoption, and must not result in serious hardship to any defendant, and (iii) consistent with
the purposes of the antitrust laws of the United States, and the telecommunications regulatory regime of the United
Kingdom. This standard protects against overbroad modifications, and recognizes that mere inconvenience or some
hardship to a defendant will not preclude a modification, but only ``serious'' hardship. The loss of opportunity
to profit from anticompetitive conduct is not a ``serious'' hardship within the meaning of this standard. Any proposed
modification, to be consistent with the antitrust laws, must not be of an anticompetitive character, and must protect
competition or consumers in the United States. Modifications must also be consistent with the system of regulation
of telecommunications in the United Kingdom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VII permits the United States, where any party has sought modifications of the Final Judgment, to invoke any
of the visitorial provisions contained in Section V of the Final Judgment in order to obtain from defendants any information
or documents needed to evaluate the proposed modification prior to decision by the Court.

5. Visitorial and Compliance Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V of the Final Judgment allows the Department of Justice to monitor defendants' compliance by several means.
Section V.A obliges defendants to maintain records and documents sufficient to show their compliance with the Final
Judgment's requirements. Sections V.B and V.C enable the United States to gain access to inspect and copy the records
and documents of defendants, and also to have access to their personnel for interviews or to take sworn testimony.
Section V.B covers access to MCI, as well as to NewCo's operations in the United States. To avoid difficulties that
might arise in applying that visitorial procedure to discovery directed at foreign operations of NewCo, Section
V.C. provides that NewCo documents and personnel, wherever located (including abroad), would be produced by NewCo
in the United States, within sixty days of request in the case of documents, and subject to the reasonable convenience
of the persons involved in the case of requests for interviews or sworn testimony. Section V.D permits the United States
also to require any defendant to submit written reports relating to any matters contained in the Final Judgment. Finally,
Section V.E supplies confidentiality protections for information and documents furnished by defendants to the
United States under the other provisions of Section V. It permits the Department of Justice to share information and
documents with the Federal Communications Commission (subject to confidentiality protections), and to share information
with the Office of Telecommunications (``OFTEL''), the United Kingdom telecommunications regulator.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IX.B of the proposed Final Judgment specifies that the substantive restrictions and obligations of the Final
Judgment shall expire five years after the entry of the judgment. Five years is an appropriate duration for the substantive
provisions because the joint venture is expected by BT and MCI to last a minimum of five years and has been planned on
that basis. In addition, MCI can enter BT's assigned territory outside the Americas to compete with BT five years after
closing without losing its special rights in BT. The parties have committed by separate stipulation to notify the
Department whether they will continue the joint venture six months before the expiration of the Final Judgment's
substantive requirements, giving the United States an opportunity to decide whether it is necessary to take further
action to protect competition. The international telecommunications markets, including the market or markets
for international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom and the emerging
market or markets for seamless global telecommunications services, may evolve rapidly during the next five years,
in part due to the transactions under consideration in this case and the Final Judgment. Under these circumstances,
the United States does not consider it necessary to impose a lengthier duration on the substantive provisions of the
proposed Final Judgment.

B. Effects of the Proposed Final Judgment on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transactions between BT and MCI represent the first opportunity the Department of Justice has had to consider
the competitive consequences of the acquisition of a substantial interest in a major United States international
telecommunications provider by a foreign telecommunications provider with market power in its home market. The
formation of an exclusive international joint venture between such firms to provide a wide range of enhanced telecommunications
services presents additional competitive issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BT-MCI joint venture may enable the parties to offer services that they would not otherwise provide. But the BT-MCI
transactions also pose substantial risks to competition in the United States, owing to BT's vertically integrated
virtual monopoly in local services and its dominant position in long distance domestic and international services
in the United Kingdom, which when combined with MCI's competitive long distance services would give rise to increased
incentives for BT's market power to be used to favor MCI and NewCo and disadvantage competitors in the United States.
In other circumstances involving vertical integration between large monopoly providers of local exchange telecommunications
services and competitive long distance providers in the United States, the Department of Justice has obtained various
forms of relief under the antitrust laws to protect competition.

, 603 F. Supp. 730 (D.D.C. 1984). While the relief proposed here is not the same as in those cases, it serves a similar
competitive purpose, taking into account the particular circumstances and risks associated with the transactions
between MCI and BT. These include the unique practices and relationships between carriers in the provision of international
telecommunications services, the continued existence of MCI as a separate entity following these transactions,
and the involvement of a foreign telecommunications provider subject to a distinct regulatory regime overseas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States believes that the relief proposed here, including both the substantive restrictions and obligations
and the ability of the Court to modify the Final Judgment to respond to additional competitive problems, will substantially
benefit competition. The ability of MCI and NewCo to realize anticompetitive advantages in the United States will
be substantially constrained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will allow the transactions between BT and MCI to proceed, and any benefits from
them to be realized by consumers. At the same time, it will provide United States competitors with increased means
to detect discrimination, protect them against misuse of their confidential business information, and enable them
to respond to BT's provision of international simple resale through MCI and NewCo with services of their own to the
United Kingdom that could bypass BT's international switched correspondent services and alleviate the risks of
anticompetitive conduct involving MCI and NewCo. It will also provide the United States with a mechanism to modify
the Final Judgment, in response to post-judgment changed circumstances or other events, without having to initiate
separate antitrust litigation. This opportunity to impose additional restrictions on defendants to protect competition
and consumers in the United States will ensure against any possibility that the other substantive provisions of the
Final Judgment and existing regulatory requirements may prove insufficient to protect competition. Thus, the modification
provision will serve as an additional important deterrent to anticompetitive behavior.

Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and
reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of such
actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment has
no 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 effect in any subsequent private lawsuits that may be brought against defendants in this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, persons affected by unreasonable discrimination on the part of MCI, in violation of 47 U.S.C. 202, may
complain to the Federal Communications Commission as provided by 47 U.S.C. 208, for such relief as is available under
the Communications Act and the Commission's regulations, or bring suit for damages pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 206. Persons
affected by an undue preference or undue discrimination on the part of BT in violation of Condition 17 of BT's license,
or other violation of BT's license, in favor of MCI or NewCo, may complain to the United Kingdom Office of Telecommunications
for such relief as OFTEL is authorized to provide under the United Kingdom Telecommunications Act and BT's license.
Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will not impair the bringing of such complaints and actions, and indeed will likely
facilitate the effective detection and prevention of anticompetitive conduct through existing regulatory mechanisms.

As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposed Final Judgment
should be modified may submit written comments to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section, U.S.
Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 Fourth Street, N.W., Room 8104, Washington, D.C. 20001, within the
60-day period provided by the Act. These comments and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent
to the proposed Judgment at any time prior to entry. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction
over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate to carry out or construe
the Final Judgment, to modify or terminate any of its provisions, to enforce compliance, and to punish any violations
of its provisions. Modifications of the Final Judgment may be sought by the United States or by the defendants under
the standards described therein.

Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation to seek an injunction to
prevent the proposed transactions between BT and MCI. The United States rejected that alternative because the relief
in the proposed Final Judgment, together with existing regulatory safeguards in the United States and the United
Kingdom, should provide protection against significant anticompetitive effects on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In formulating the proposed Final Judgment, the United States also considered the extent to which the regulatory
regime in the United Kingdom and the FCC have mechanisms currently in place to address anticompetitive conduct, including
discrimination, by providers of international telecommunications services. The United States considered including
in the Final Judgment specific nondiscrimination conditions, enforceable through contempt sanctions, to deter
discrimination by BT in favor of MCI and NewCo. It concluded that the other provisions of the Final Judgment, existing
regulatory requirements and enforcement practices in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the ability of
the United States to seek modifications of the Final Judgment, are sufficient to protect competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States was not prepared to rely on existing regulation alone to prevent harm to competition and consumers
in the United States. While the United Kingdom regulatory authorities share with the United States a generally procompetitive
approach to telecommunications policy, protection of competition and consumers in the United States is not the primary
goal of United Kingdom regulators. There are a number of important telecommunications regulatory issues that remain
unsettled in the United Kingdom, and some policies specifically limiting competition remain in effect, such as the
duopoly on international facilities-based competition. Historic experience and the present state of competition
in the United States and the United Kingdom were also taken into account in determining that this relief was needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because, however, the telecommunications regulatory regime in the United Kingdom now embodies or is developing
important competitive policies and safeguards, the United States concluded that it is possible to protect competition
adequately in these circumstances without placing specific antidiscrimination prohibitions in the proposed Final
Judgment or prohibiting the MCI&hyph;BT transactions, altogether, as would likely have been necessary otherwise.
The procompetitive direction of United Kingdom telecommunications regulation is evidenced by the ending of the
BT-Mercury domestic duopoly policy in 1991, and by the more recent licensing of additional facilities-based domestic
competitors to BT and Mercury and the grant of several international simple resale licenses to, among others, United
States firms. OFTEL, the principal U.K. telecommunications regulatory authority, has issued a statement on interconnection
and accounting separation setting forth policies and targets for making a wider variety of interconnection arrangements
with BT available to competitors, and creating greater transparency in the relationship between BT's own network
and retail operations. OFTEL is seeking to improve its regulatory oversight of BT and promote greater competition
in other respects as well. In sum, the United Kingdom telecommunications regulatory regime has taken steps to promote
and foster competition that have not yet occurred in most of the world, and it was appropriate for the United States
to take these developments into account in not requiring more extensive relief to be included in the proposed Final
Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States also considered issues of international comity in shaping the proposed Final Judgment. Consistently
with its longstanding enforcement policy, the United States sought in the substantive provisions of the Final Judgment
to avoid situations that could give rise to international conflicts between sovereign governments and their agencies.
The substantive requirements imposed on MCI and NewCo have been tailored so as to avoid direct United States involvement
in BT's operation of its telecommunications network in the United Kingdom on an ongoing basis, minimizing the potential
for conflict with United Kingdom authorities.

[T]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must
be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public
interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree.
The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether
the settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest.'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the
effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree.

A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they waive their
right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of
litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost
and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation.

The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has recently submitted to the OMB for review the following proposal for the collection of information under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The title of the information collection: Proposed Rule, 10 CFR Part 54, ``Nuclear Power Plant License Renewal.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The form number if applicable: Not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. How often collection is required: One-time submission with application for renewal of an operating license for
a nuclear power plant and occasional collections for holders of renewed licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Who will be required or requested to report: Commercial nuclear power plant licensees who wish to renew their operating
licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. An estimate of the number of responses: As many as 100 licensees may take advantage of this provision over the next
30 years. It is anticipated that three or four responses will be received on average each year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed to complete this requirement: The estimated burden on the licensee
is being reduced from approximately 135,000 hours to 94,000 hours per license renewal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. An indication of whether Section 3504(h), Pub. L. 96&hyph;511 applies: Applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Abstract: The license renewal rule (10 CFR Part 54) which was completed in December 1991, established procedures,
criteria, and standards governing nuclear power plant license renewal, including information submittal and recordkeeping
requirements. However, many of the details of the current rule are not clear with respect to requirements and procedures.
The proposed rule amendment clarifies the requirements, eliminates unnecessary terminology, and simplifies the
Integrated Plant Assessment to focus only on those passive, long-lived, nonredundant structures and components,
whose functionality is not easily verified through performance or condition monitoring.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a proposed revision to a guide in its Regulatory Guide
Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable
to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in
evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications
for permits and licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft guide, temporarily identified by its task number, DG&hyph;1031 (which should be mentioned in all correspondence
concerning this draft guide), is a proposed revision to Regulatory Guide 1.160, ``Monitoring the Effectiveness
of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants.'' This guide is being revised to provide guidance on meeting the Commission's
current rules on maintenance and on monitoring the effectiveness of maintenance in nuclear poser plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position
in this area. It has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are being solicited on the draft guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written
comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Comments will be
most helpful if received by August 25, 1994.

An exemption was requested from Section III.G.2.c to the extent that it requires the separation of redundant cables
and equipment by hour rated fire barriers plus area-wide suppression and detection. Specifically, these locations
are not protected by automatic fire suppression system or area-wide fire detection systems.

This fire area consists of the mechanical penetration areas on elevations 78 feet and 100 feet of the auxiliary building.
It is constructed of reinforced concrete with 3-hour fire rated barriers. Doors, dampers, and HVAC duct penetrations
are not 3-hour rated; however, these are the subject of a generic exemption previously evaluated to be acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elevation 100 ft contains the fuel handling area exhaust ventilation equipment and the containment pressure relief
exhaust unit and the steam generator blowdown tanks. The area also contains some safety-related instrument panels.
Elevation 78 ft. contains piping for various systems which run between the auxiliary and the containment building.
The area also contains service water piping which enters the auxiliary building from the service water intake structure.
Partial area fire detection is provided for the protection of the major fire hazards on elevations 78 ft. and 100 ft.
Continuous thermal strip detectors are also provided to protect charcoal filters in the ventilation units. Additionally,
automatic fire suppression is provided in the ventilation units by a water deluge spray system actuated by the thermal
strip detectors. Portable fire extinguishers and manual hose stations are also provided on elevation 100 ft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fire protection in this area does not comply with the technical requirements of Section III.G.2.c of Appendix
R because the redundant cables are protected by a 1-hour rated barrier but, without automatic suppression and area-wide
detection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a concern that a fire in this fire area could cause the loss of normal shutdown capability. The in-site combustibles
in the Mechanical Penetration area will result in a total fire load of approximately 28,000 BTU/ft

 (21 minutes on the ASTM time-temperature curve). The major combustibles in this area consist of the charcoal filters
and electrical cable insulation. The charcoal filters are protected by automatic deluge suppression systems. The
electrical cables are widely dispersed and protected by the partial detection system. There is a reasonable assurance
that a fire in this area will be detected by the partial fire detection system in its early stages and extinguished by
the fixed fire suppression system or the fire brigade before adjacent safety-related areas are threatened. The 1-hour
fire barriers would maintain one division of cables needed for safe shutdown free of fire damage until the fire brigade
could extinguish the fire.

Based on the above evaluation, it is concluded that the existing fire protection features already in place combined
with the 1-hour fire barriers in the above described fire areas provide a level of fire protection equivalent to the
technical requirements of Section III.G.2.c of Appendix R. Therefore, the exemption is granted.''

Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc. (Licensee or WIX) is the holder of Byproduct Material License
No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts
30 and 34. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess sealed sources of iridium-192 in various radiography devices
for use in performing industrial radiography activities. The license, originally issued on August 12, 1991, is due
to expire on August 31, 1996.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1993 and in January and March 1994, the NRC conducted inspections and investigations of Western Industrial
X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., at the company's offices in Evanston, Wyoming, and at temporary job sites near Granger,
Wyoming. These inspections and investigations identified numerous violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements,
including some violations which were found to have recurred after being found in previous inspections. These violations
were described in inspection reports 030&hyph;32190/93&hyph;01 and 030&hyph;32190/94&hyph;01 issued on May
12, 1994. In addition, based on the investigations conducted by the Office of Investigations (OI), several of the
violations have been determined by the NRC to have been committed deliberately by Licensee employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a March 2, 1994, letter to the Licensee, the NRC described the apparent violations that had been identified as of
that date and confirmed the arrangements for the Licensee to attend an enforcement conference in the NRC's Arlington,
Texas office. The enforcement conference, which was transcribed, occurred on April 1, 1994. The Licensee was represented
by Mr. Larry D. Wicks, who is the president and owner of WIX as well as the company's designated radiation safety officer
(RSO).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most significant of the NRC's concerns, and many of the violations, are related to a July 31, 1993, incident involving
a WIX radiographer and radiographer's assistant who were performing radiography on a pipeline near LaBarge, Wyoming.
The incident involved a radiographic device containing a 37-curie, sealed iridium-192 source and resulted in a potentially
significant radiation exposure to the radiographer's assistant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This incident was reviewed during the inspection and investigation that began in January 1994. The following information
regarding this incident is based on joint interviews conducted by the inspector and investigator; on signed, sworn
statements taken by the investigator during these interviews; and on statements made by Mr. Wicks at the April 1 enforcement
conference. With the exception of certain statements made by Mr. Wicks at the enforcement conference, which are noted
below, all other statements were made to the inspector and investigator during their joint interviews of WIX personnel.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The radiographer admitted that he violated NRC requirements by not observing the assistant as she radiographed welds
and moved equipment from one location to another (in a later statement, the radiographer said he was aware he was responsible
for the assistant but not aware that he had to observer performing radiographic operations 100% of the time). The assistant
admitted that she violated NRC requirements by not performing a radiation survey after each radiographic exposure
and by not locking the sealed radioactive source in the radiography device prior to moving equipment to another weld.
The assistant stated further that after moving the equipment to another weld she noticed her survey instrument was
``pegged,'' an that her self-reading pocket dosimeter was off-scale, both indications that the device's radioactive
source had not been returned to its fully shielded position or had been jostled from its shielded position when the
device was moved. The assistant stated that her alarm ratemeter, a protective device which is set to alarm in a radiation
field of 500 millirem/hour, did not alarm but added that it was probably turned off. Both she and the radiographer stated
that she immediately brought this incident to the radiographer's attention an that he ``cranked'' the source into
the device and locked it, and that they stopped work for the day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the assistant and the radiographer stated that they prepared incident reports for their employer, Larry Wicks,
the company president an RSO, and that the incident reports were false in that they falsely stated that the radiographer
and the assistant were working together at the time of the incident and falsely stated that they had surveyed the device
and locked the source in the device prior to its being moved. The Assistant claimed that she told Mr. Wicks at the time
the reports were turned in that the incident reports were false, but Mr. Wicks denied this claim during interviews
with the inspector and investigator and at the enforcement conference, stating that he did not know the incident reports
were false until brought to his attention by the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation and at the enforcement conference that after learning of the incident he
sent the assistant's thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) in for immediate processing along with other TLDs worn by
company personnel during the month of July 1993. Mr. Wicks also stated that all of the TLDs were sent in the same package.
However, the company that processes TLSs for WIX, Laudauer, Inc., stated, through its representative, to NRC personnel
that while it had received TLDs from WIX for other employees for the month of July 1993, it had no record of receiving
a TLD for the assistant for the month of July 1993 and no record of receiving a request from Mr. Wicks for immediate processing
of any TLDs sent in for that month. Exposure records mailed by Landauer to WIX and retained by WIX contain no information
regarding the assistant's exposure for the month of July 1993 (her exposure records for all other months are available).
The assistant, whom Mr. Wicks placed on restricted duty pending a determination of their exposure, also told NRC personnel
that she persisted in trying to obtain from Mr. Wicks her exposure record for the month of July and that Mr. Wicks eventually_about
three weeks after the incident_told her that she had received 350 millirem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation, however, that he never provided the assistant an exposure estimate based
on Landauer's processing of the TLD because he did not have such a number to give her. The only explanation he has offered
for not pursuing the question of her July 1993 exposure is that he was very busy. Despite the occurrence of the following
events, Mr. Wicks has stated that he was not reminded of the need to evaluate the assistant's exposure from the incident
or for the month of July 1993: (1) Placing the assistant on restricted duty from the date of the incident (July 31, 1993)
until she left his employ in September 1993; (2) receiving Landauer reports for July 1993 which contained no exposure
records for the assistant even though, according to Mr. Wicks' statement, he had sent in her TLD for immediate emergency
processing; (3) preparing a summary of the assistant's radiation exposure history for her employer, which included
the period in question (July 1993); and (4) responding in the fall of 1993 to a request from the NRC for the radiation
exposure reports of terminated employees. In responding to the latter request, Mr. Wicks did not provide a report
for the radiographer's assistant despite having provided one for her husband, whose termination date occurred five
days after hers. As of the time of the inspection and investigation in January 1994, Mr. Wicks had not performed an adequate
evaluation to determine the assistant's exposure resulting from the July 31, 1993 incident. After further requests
from the NRC, Mr. Wicks submitted on March 8, 1994, an estimate of 6 rems for the assistant's whole body exposure and
at the enforcement conference characterized that estimate as ``pure and simply a guess,'' noting that ``I had to have
something to send you.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its inspection and investigation of the July 31, 1993 incident, as well as the information obtained during
the enforcement conference, the NRC has concluded that the Licensee and its employees violated NRC requirements
by failing to: (1) perform an evaluation of the assistant's radiation exposure to ensure compliance with NRC limits,
as required by 10 CFR 20.201, and send the assistant's TLD in for immediate processing when her pocket dosimeter had
gone off-scale, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(d); (2) check the alarm function on alarm ratemeters prior to the start
of each shift, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(f)(1); (3) perform a radiation survey of a radiography device following
each exposure, as required by 10 CFR 34.43(b); (4) lock the sealed radioactive source in the device after each exposure,
as required by 10 CFR 34.22(a); (5) ensure that radiographers supervise assistant radiographers who are performing
radiographers operations, as required by 10 CFR 34.44, a repeat violation in that it occurred in July 1993, was discussed
during the inspection in January 1994, and was found again in March 1994; (6) provide NRC a report of an individual's
radiation exposure following the individual's termination of employment, as required by 10 CFR 20.408(b); and (7)
ensure that alarm ratemeters worn by radiography personnel were calibrated at a one-year frequency, as required
by 34.33(f)(4), a repeat violation in that it was found and discussed with Mr. Wicks following the inspection and investigation
in April 1993, recurred in July 1993 and was found again in January 1994.

Other violations found during the NRC's inspections and investigations, but unrelated to the July 1993 incident,
include the Licensee's failure to: (1) ensure that pocket dosimeters worn by radiography personnel were checked
for correct response to radiation at 12-month intervals, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(c), a violation that occurred
on January 18, 1994, 13 days after the inspector had informed the RSO that he should remove uncalibrated dosimeters
from service; (2) perform and record quarterly audits of radiography personnel for all calendar quarters in 1992,
as required by license condition; (3) maintain constant surveillance and immediate control of licensed material
in March 1993, as required by 10 CFR 20.207; (4) submit to the NRC a quality assurance program for use of shipping containers,
as required by 10 CFR 71.12(b), a repeat violation in that it was cited in 1992 and had not been corrected by January 1994;
and (5) leak test sealed sources prior to removing them from storage and transferring them to the manufacturer in April
1993 and December 1993, as required by license condition.

The NRC has also concluded from its inspections and investigations that Mr. Wicks and employees of WIX violated the
provisions of 10 CFR 30.10, ``Deliberate Misconduct,'' a regulation which prohibits individuals from deliberately
causing a licensee to be in noncompliance with NRC requirements and prohibits individuals from deliberately providing
materially false information to the NRC or a licensee. Specifically, based on its review of the July 31, 1993 incident,
its review of the OI findings, and its review of the enforcement conference transcript, the NRC has concluded that
Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to perform an evaluation of the assistant's radiation exposure; that Mr. Wicks deliberately
failed to send the assistant's TLD in for immediate processing; that the radiographer deliberately failed to watch
an assistant perform radiography operations; and that the radiographer and assistant deliberately provided materially
false information to the Licensee about the incident.

Based on its review of violations that were unrelated to the July 1993 incident, the NRC has concluded that Mr. Wicks
deliberately failed to perform and record quarterly audits of radiography personnel in 1992, because Mr. Wicks stated
that he was aware of these requirements and his responsibility to comply with them but failed to do so. The NRC also has
concluded that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to ensure that alarm ratemeters used by radiography personnel in March,
April and July 1993 and January 1994 were calibrated at a one-year frequency, again because Mr. Wicks stated that he
was aware of these requirements and his responsibility to comply with them but repeatedly failed to do so.

Based on the above, it appears that Licensee employees, including the president and radiation safety officer, have
engaged in deliberate misconduct by deliberately violating NRC requirements that are important to the protection
of radiography personnel and the public and have failed to ensure compliance with numerous requirements that are
important to the safe use of radiographic sources. Deliberate violations of the nature described above cannot and
will not be tolerated by the NRC. Further, the history of numerous violations, including repetitive violations,
and the failure to follow through on important safety issues, indicate that Mr. Wicks, who is the president and radiation
safety officer, is either incapable or unwilling to ensure that the Licensee's radiography program is conducted
in accordance with all NRC requirements.

I find that the significance of the violations and deliberate misconduct described above are such that the public
health, safety, and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.

The Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC or the licensee), is the holder of Facility Operating License (Possession
Only) No. DPR&hyph;3 which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or plant).
The license provides, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the
Commission now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility is a permanently shutdown pressurized water reactor, currently in the process of being prepared for
decommissioning, and is located at the licensee site in Franklin County, Massachusetts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee, by letter dated February 27,1992, supplemented by letter dated January 19,1 993, informed the NRC and
YAEC had permanently ceased power operations, removed the fuel from the reactor to the fuel pool, and had begun to develop
detailed plans to decommission the facility. The reactor was actually shut down on October 1, 1991; thus, the fuel
has now undergone over two years and seven months of decay. The NRC in a license amendment dated August 5, 1992, modified
License No. DPR&hyph;3 to possession only status. The license is conditioned so that YAEC is not authorized to operate
the reactor and fuel may not be placed in the reactor vessel, thus formalizing the YAEC commitment to permanently cease
power operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated September 28, 1992, the licensee requested an amendment to the Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC)
Indemnity Agreement No. B&hyph;17 which would reduce the primary level of financial protection maintained at the
plant to $4.5 million from the current level of $200 million and provide relief from participation in the industry
retrospective rating plan (secondary level). This letter was supplemented by the licensee letter to the Commission
dated January 19, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The justification presented by the licensee for amendment of its indemnity agreement is that because of the permanently
shutdown status of the plant, defueled condition of the reactor, and possession only license amendment (which prohibits
operation), 10 CFR 140.11 no longer applies to YAEC. Given these considerations, the licensee contends that 10 CFR
140.12, which describes financial protection for reactors not covered by 10 CFR 140.11, applies to YAEC. The licensee
also addressed past NRC actions with respect to relief granted to the consolidated Edison facility, Indian Point
Unit 1. Consequently, the licensee has requested that its indemnity agreement be amended such that the licensee would
no longer be required to participate in the secondary protection program, and that its primary financial protection
be reduced to the minimum required under 10 CFR 140.12, which is $4.5 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff has determined on its own initiative that an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11 is required
in order to implement an amendment to the licensee indemnity agreement. The bases for providing this exemption to
10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) are provided herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical issues associated with the application of the Price-Anderson
Act to permanently shut down reactors in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees
of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' dated May 10, 1993. In this evaluation, the staff concluded
that the Commission has discretionary authority to respond to licensee requests for a reduction in the level of primary
financial protection and withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Depending on
the plant-specific configuration and the time since permanent shutdown, the staff also concluded that potential
hazards may exist at permanently shutdown reactors for which financial protection is warranted. The staff concluded
that accidents and hazards insured against under the Price-Anderson Act go beyond design basis accidents and beyond
those considered ``credible'' as that term is used in 10 CFR Part 100 and cases interpreting the application of that
regulation. The Commission issued a SRM in response to SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 on July 13, 1993. In this SRM, the Commission
approved a staff recommendation to permit a reduction of primary level coverage to $100 million through the exemption
process after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period and after allowing withdrawal from participation in the secondary
level of financial protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the exercise of its discretionary authority, the Commission may, as long as a potential hazard exists at a permanently
shutdown reactor, require the full amount of primary financial protection and full participation in the industry
retrospective rating plan. At such time that the hazard is determined to no longer exist or to be significantly reduced,
the Commission may reduce the amount of primary financial protection and permit the licensee to withdraw from participation
in the industry retrospective rating plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the legislative history of the Price-Anderson Act does not explicitly consider the potential hazards that
might exist after termination of operation, the staff generically evaluated the offsite consequences associated
with normal and abnormal operations, design basis accidents, and beyond design basis accidents for reactors that
have been permanently defueled and shut down. The staff concluded that where an appropriate cooling time has elapsed
since plant shutdown, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of spent fuel and radioactive materials,
no reasonably conceivable potential accident exists that could cause significant offsite damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As summarized in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, a severe transportation accident could potentially result in local contamination
requiring cleanup and offsite liabilities resulting from traffic disruption and consequential damages. This type
of accident would warrant maintaining some level of liability insurance. The liabilities an indemnification requirements
associated with the transfer of spent fuel from the licensee to the Department of Energy will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis at a future time when spent fuel is shipped to a repository.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As further set forth in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, the most significant accident sequence for a permanently defueled
and shutdown reactor involves the complete loss of water from a light water reactor spent fuel pool. This beyond-design-basis
accident sequence could result in a zirconium fuel cladding fire that could propagate through the spent fuel storage
pool and result in significant offsite consequences. The potential consequences of such an accident could involve
billions of dollars. Although such an accident is beyond the design bases, it may be considered ``reasonably conceivable''
and could warrant requiring substantial financial protection. Such an accident is possible during the first year
after reactor shutdown for a low density spent fuel storage configuration and during the first two or three years after
shutdown for spent fuel stored in certain high density configurations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accident scenarios involving blockage of coolant channels in conjunction with loss of spent fuel pool water could
hypothetically extend the time within which a zirconium fuel cladding fire could occur. However, in addition to being
less likely than loss of water, air flow to react with the zirconium and to disperse fission products would likely be
inhibited by such blockage. The staff believes that this sequence approaches the strictly hypothetical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the requisite cooling period after reactor shutdown has elapsed, the zirconium fuel cladding fire sequence
after a postulated loss of spent fuel pool water is no longer a concern since the fuel would air cool sufficiently to
avoid zirconium fuel cladding combustion. Possible accident scenarios, after these cooling period have elapsed,
have greatly reduced consequences but could still result in small releases or precautionary evacuations which could
result in offsite liability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the Yankee Nuclear Power Station plant-specific evaluation, the NRC staff independently evaluated
the legal and technical justifications for this exemption. In particular, the NRC evaluated the current Yankee status,
that is, the plant is permanently shut down and defueled, the license has been amended to authorize ``possession only,''
the possession only license amendment prohibits fuel movement from the spent fuel pool into the reactor building,
and the fuel is stored in a low density configuration. The staff concludes, after evaluation of the remaining spectrum
of accidents and considering that the stored fuel has decayed for over two years and seven months and is stored in a low
density configuration, that any such accident would result in greatly reduced offsite consequences. Thus, the staff
further concludes that the YNPS meets the criterion established in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 for relief from the full
financial protection requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the licensee presented legal views and opinions regarding the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 versus 10 CFR
140.11(a)(4), the staff did not concur with those legal views and opinions and concludes that the licensee has not
demonstrated the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 to the YNPS. The staff has also concluded that the Three Mile Island
Unit 2 (TMI&hyph;2) claims settlement experience (an accident which did not result in a significant release of radioactivity)
provides a reasonable basis for establishing the appropriate level of primary insurance coverage. Because TMI&hyph;2
claims have reached $60 million and a large number of TMI&hyph;2 claims are still unsettled, the staff concluded that
a level of $100 million for primary financial protection coverage is warranted. This level of primary insurance coverage
is consistent with the SRM dated July 13, 1993, based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, for relief from financial protection
requirements.

The staff, based on its independent evaluation, consistent with the Commission July 13, 1993 SRM based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127,
``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' has concluded
that sufficient bases exist for approval of a partial exemption from the financial protection requirements for the
YNPS. The staff has also concluded that granting the proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences
of any accidents or reduce the margin of safety at the facility.

Based on the discussion presented in Sections III and IV above, the Commission has determined, that pursuant to 10
CFR 140.8, this exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission
grants an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that primary financial protection
in the amount of $100 million shall be maintained, and an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective
rating plan (secondary level financial protection) is granted for the YNPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 31651).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective immediately.

Pursusant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 23, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The purpose of this rule change is to mandate market maker utilization of the facilities of a registered clearing agency
to ensure efficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions. For securities listed on Nasdaq, this
will be accomplished by eliminating the ``25 mile exception''' from Section 7(a) in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD
By-Laws. (Part V articulates the basic requirements applicable to Nasdaq market makers.) Even today, this exception
is quite limited in that it is only available to market makers who are located more than 25 miles from a clearing facility,
limit their Nasdaq market making activity to Nasdaq SmallCap

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 securities, and do not participate in the Small Order Execution System (``SOES'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 With respect to equity securities quoted in the OTCBB, a new requirement is being proposed to mandate market maker
participation in a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement of transactions in OTCBB securities
that are clearing eligible.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, parallel requirements will exist for the two largest equity market segments in which NASD members function
as market makers and utilize the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') for trade reporting and comparison
purposes.

ACT is the primary facility for collecting, processing, and disseminating transaction reports on Nasdaq securities
as well as equity issues quoted in the OTCBB. ACT also facilitates the clearance and settlement of inter-member transactions
by locking-in trade details for transmission to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''). The generation
of locked-in trades by ACT enhances the overall efficiency of the clearance and settlement process and virtually
eliminates a members risk exposure respecting uncompared trades. These benefits cannot be realized, however, unless
the broker-dealers on both sides of the trade have some form of participation in a registered clearing agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposal is believed to be consistent with the provisions of Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(a)(1)
of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) contains the Congressional findings that have guided development of the National Market
System. These findings include a directive to apply state-of-the-art data processing and communications techniques
to achieve more efficient and effective market operations and to ensure the economical execution of securities orders.
Similarly, Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and
processing information with respect to and facilitating transactions in securities. Finally, Section 17A(a)(1)
reflects the statutory goals of a national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These
goals include the application of new data processing and communications techniques to create the opportunity for
more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement. The NASD believes that this proposed
rule change is fully consistent with these statutory requirements. In sum, the primary objectives of this rule change
are to minimize risk exposure from uncompared trades and foster optimal usage of ACT to lock-in the details of individual
trades prior to their submission to a registered clearing agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Dannelly Field are in compliance
with applicable requirements of Part 150, effective June 13, 1994. Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility
program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before December 10, 1994. This notice also announces
the availability of this program for public review and comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposed for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Montgomery Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on March 3, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during the Dannelly Field Part 150 Noise Study dated January 1993. It was requested that the FAA
review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation
measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility
program under section 104(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Montgomery Airport
Authority. The specific maps under consideration are, ``1992 Noise Levels'' and ``1997 Preferred Runway Operations,''
in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps for Dannelly Field are in compliance with applicable requirements.
This determination is effective on June 13, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps
is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR
Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment
to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Dannelly Field, also effective on June 13, 1994.
Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of
noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program.
The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before December 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 150, &sect;150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 31, 1993, the FHWA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which the agency requested comments on the three options it is considering for coordinating an orderly transition
of distance, weight, and speed traffic control sign legends from English to metric units consistent with the Federal
Highway Administration's five-year plan to convert its activities and business operations to the metric system,
as required under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. 58 FR 46036. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 1 involved making the conversion over an extended period of time (a maximum of 4 to 7 years) through routine maintenance
replacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2 recommended a quick conversion of all signs over a short period (6 months to 1 year) through a concentrated
effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3 encouraged a two-phase conversion process using dual posting of both metric and English messages for speed,
weight, and distance signs in the first phase (complete by September 30, 1996). The second phase would involve the
removal of all of the English units with metric units remaining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments were to be received by November 1, 1993. Comments continue to be received sporadically. As of January
12, 1994, the FHWA received 2,736 comments to this docket divided as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Responses From the General Public
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eighty-six percent of the comments received opposed converting English measurement signs to metric. A majority
of the negative responses stated the funds to convert the signs could be better used for repair of roads and bridges
or for charitable purposes. A number of comments advised that the conversion to metric was unnecessary and discussed
personal objections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responses in favor of the metric change were split between Options 2 and 3, with Option 2 receiving about twice the
number of favorable comments as Option 3. In general, those that strongly supported converting to metric favored
``the quicker the better'' Option 2, and many commented that the United States was behind most of the other nations
in adopting the metric system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where nearly every negative response mentioned the cost involved with converting and the need to do other things with
that money, almost none of the responses in favor of change mentioned costs. Also, quite a few of the positive responses
stated that a public education program was needed before the change was made.

Responses From Organizations and Other Federal Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These responses included the American Public Works Association, The Department of Commerce, the Institute of Transportation
Engineers, U.S. Metric Association, and several others. There was one negative response with the others mostly favoring
Option 2 (quick change). The U.S. Department of Commerce (the lead Federal agency in the change to metric) recommended
``that metric conversion of highway signs be delayed until after successful completion of FHWA's current conversion
plan.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Responses From Cities/Counties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nearly all responses, both positive and negative, identified the need for special funding and a public education
program if the decision is made to change signs to metric units. Most of the negative responses especially emphasized
the cost of this proposal. Several commented that this was another Federal mandate without thought of how it would
be locally financed. Most of the positive responses favored Option 2.

Responses From States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-five States responded. Eight States expressed opposition to the metrication of highway signs and all of the
eight questioned the need to make the change. A ninth State expressed opposition but stated that if the sign legends
must be converted to metric it would recommend a modified Option 2. The remaining 36 States supported the switch to
metric. Most of these expressed support for Option 2 or some combination of two or all three of the Options. One State
recommended implementation of the change using a method different from all of the three Options. Most of the State
responses, both positive and negative, requested special funding and an education/public information program
before implementation. Several States included an estimate of the cost to convert signs on the State highway systems
and also estimated that the conversion costs of the signs on the non-State highway system, because of the much larger
mileage, would cost a great deal more than the State system conversion.

Agency Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to the August 31, 1993, notice, Congress passed the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act of 1994. Public Law 103&hyph;122, 107 Stat. 1198. Section 331 of this Act prohibits the use of Department
of Transportation Fiscal Year 1994 funds for implementing metric signing. Currently, there are several proposed
bills in both the Senate and House of Representatives placing future restriction on the changing of highway signs
from the English system to the metric system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consideration of the docket responses, the current statutory prohibition, and a possible future Congressional
restriction on using Federal funds for metric signs, the FHWA will not require the implementation of metric sign legends
until at least after 1996. Before any nationally directed conversion to metric highway signs is implemented, the
agency will conduct a strong public education program and will consider other appropriate measures to assure that
such a conversion would be as smooth as possible.

For these reasons, ED must set strict deadlines for grant applications. Prospective applicants can avoid disappointment
if they understand that failure to meet a deadline will mean that an applicant will be rejected without any consideration
whatever.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Offers are judged in competition with others, and failure to conform with any substantive requirements of the RFP
will result in rejection of the offer without any consideration whatever.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Do not accept any advice you receive that is contrary to instructions contained in either the CBD synopsis or the RFP.
No ED employee is authorized to consider a proposal which is non-responsive to the RFP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A subscription to the CBD is available for $208.00 per year via second class mailing or $261.00 per year via first class

 This notice invites interested parties and manufacturers and processors of seven substances subject to the Multi-Substance
Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity at 40 CFR 799.5050 who wish to participate in or monitor consent agreement negotiations
pursuant to 40 CFR 790.22(b) to contact the EPA in writing. This notice also announces a public meeting to negotiate
Enforceable Consent Agreements (ECAs). The seven substances for which testing will be negotiated are acetone (CAS

These seven substances along with 1-butanol (CAS No. 71&hyph;36&hyph;3), diethyl ether (CAS No. 60&hyph;29&hyph;7),
and 2-ethoxyethanol (CAS No. 110&hyph;80&hyph;5) were the subject of a final test rule promulgated under section
4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA'') on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262). The final test rule requires manufacturers
and processors of the 10 substances to conduct testing for neurotoxicity. On October 8, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (CMA) and the manufacturers and processors of these substances filed suit seeking review of the rule
in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA has issued an administrative stay and proposed to revoke the final test rule as part of a settlement agreement
reached with the manufacturers of these chemicals, who have agreed to perform certain neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics
testing of the group of seven substances mentioned above, subject to execution of ECAs containing these studies.
The settlement agreement signed by EPA and industry in April 1994 will be the starting point for the ECA negotiations
(Ref. 3). EPA does not anticipate entering into an ECA for 1-butanol, diethyl ether, or 2-ethoxyethanol.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The manufacturers of 7 of the 10 chemicals subject to the final test rule have agreed, subject to certain conditions
set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct a set of neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing under
enforceable consent agreements (``ECA''). If ECA negotiations are successful, EPA believes that the previously
issued final test rule would no longer be needed. EPA believes that, under a negotiated ECA, neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics
testing would be conducted and results made publicly available more quickly, and EPA resources used more effectively,
than if EPA continued to litigate the merits of the final test rule. This Notice will allow all interested parties an
opportunity to indicate their interest in participating in the negotiations of ECAs.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262) EPA issued a test rule under TSCA section 4 that required manufacturers and processors
of ten substances to conduct testing for neurotoxicity (Ref. 1). The required testing was the same for all 10 substances
and included acute and subchronic functional observational battery and motor activity, and subchronic neuropathology
and schedule-controlled operant behavior. These 10 substances are listed below:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The manufacturers of these substances petitioned for review of the final rule under TSCA section 19 in the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals (Ref. 2). Subsequent to the filing of this challenge to the rule, EPA, the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (``CMA''), and authorized representatives of all parties challenging the rule, entered into settlement
negotiations to resolve the lawsuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these settlement discussions, CMA and the other parties to the lawsuit have agreed, subject to certain
conditions set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing
of 7 chemical substances under negotiated ECAs, to be implemented by an order issued by EPA under TSCA section 4. Testing
on two of the chemicals subject to the final rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol, is already underway. It is CMA's stated intent that such testing continue on
schedule during the pendency of this proceeding (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In turn, EPA has agreed to propose to revoke the final test rule. The proposed revocation is published elsewhere in
this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and contains a more detailed explanation of EPA's decision with regard to the anticipated testing program. EPA is
aware that the settlement agreement contemplates a reduced set of testing on fewer chemicals than the testing regimen
required by the final rule. However, EPA believes that the settlement agreement is in the public interest as it will
allow testing to proceed on an expedited basis, without the uncertainties of protracted litigation. EPA notes that
although CMA's lawsuit has been dismissed without prejudice by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, in response to a joint
motion for a stay, it can be reinstated by either party upon filing of a letter with the court (Ref. 4).

II. Testing Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The settlement agreement contemplates a testing program which would retain the full set of tests for three chemicals
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate), reduce the number of tests for four chemicals (acetone, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-amyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, and tetrahydrofuran), and eliminate testing of three chemicals (1-butanol,
diethyl ether, and 2-ethoxyethanol). It is anticipated, however, that the pharmacokinetics/metabolism test of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate may indicate that the separate testing of 1-butanol may not be necessary, and because of this, 1-butanol
manufacturers have agreed to share in the cost of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-butyl acetate testing. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate of butyl acetate will be performed
in a study of its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hydrolysis to 1-butanol. If the conversion of butyl acetate to 1-butanol is sufficiently rapid and complete, EPA
may determine that the neurotoxic effects of 1-butanol can be predicted from the results of butyl acetate testing.
If this is not the case, EPA may consider reproposing separate testing of 1-butanol. EPA believes that this testing
would represent a reasonable compromise which could avoid protracted litigation while still developing relevant
data necessary to determine the neurotoxicity of these chemical substances.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Solicitation of Interested Parties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA utilizes its procedures at 40 CFR part 790, subpart B, to develop enforceable consent agreements (ECA), implemented
through orders issued under TSCA section 4, to require health and environmental effects testing of chemical substances
in cooperation with test sponsors. EPA believes testing will be achieved more quickly, and EPA resources used more
effectively, under an ECA, compared with continued litigation on the merits of the final Multi-Substance Rule for
the Testing of Neurotoxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting interested parties for participation in or monitoring of ECA negotiations to implement the settlement
agreement in this case. Written notice of interest in being designated an ``interested party'' to the ECA negotiations
must be received by July 27, 1994. Such notice should be sent to the address listed above in the ADDRESSES section of
this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ECA negotiations will be limited to the seven chemicals outlined in the settlement agreement. The testing program
described in Appendix A of the settlement agreement (Ref. 3) will be offered for consideration during the initial
session of the ECA negotiations. Persons wishing to comment on EPA's decision to revoke all testing requirements
for 1-butanol (CAS No. 71&hyph;36&hyph;3), diethyl ether (CAS No. 60&hyph;29&hyph;7), and 2-ethoxyethanol (CAS
No. 110&hyph;80&hyph;5), and EPA's intention to propose a SNUR for 2-EE, should file these comments with EPA in response
to EPA's proposed revocation of the final rule, which is published elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These three chemicals will not be considered as part of the ECA negotiations.
