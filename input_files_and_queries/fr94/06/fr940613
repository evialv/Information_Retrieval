SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires repetitive inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary.
This amendment is prompted by the results of extensive pressure fatigue tests conducted by the manufacturer. The
actions specified by this AD are intended to detect and repair fatigue cracking in certain lap joints, which will ensure
safe operation of airplanes that have exceeded their economic design goal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 17, 1993 (58 FR 65943). That action proposed to require repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC)
inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2367, dated January 27, 1994,
be included as an additional source of service information. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance of the proposal, the
FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2367, dated January 27, 1994,
which clarifies the procedures for accomplishment of the inspections described in the Initial Release of the service
bulletin, dated December 18, 1991 (which was referenced in the proposal as the sole source of appropriate service
information). Therefore, paragraphs (a) and (c) of the final rule have been revised to reference Revision 1 of the
service bulletin as an additional source of service information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a reporting requirement to keep Boeing and
the FAA advised of findings of cracks. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that the unsafe condition addressed
by this AD (which is to detect and repair fatigue cracking in certain lap joints) will be adequately addressed by paragraph
(a) of the final rule, which requires the inspection of certain lap joints, and paragraph (c) of the final rule, which
requires the repair of all cracks found during the inspection. Therefore, since the final rule requires repetitive
inspections to detect cracks and repair of all findings of cracks, the FAA finds that a reporting requirement would
unduly burden operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further requests that the proposed rule be revised to compensate for operators that fly with cabin
pressure differentials of 2.0 psi or less when calculating the number of flight cycles to determine the compliance
time. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that operating at cabin pressure differentials of 2.0 psi or less is applicable
to only one operator. Since there are numerous factors that affect the calculation of flight cycles, such as total
number of low pressure cycles, amount of thrust, number of gross weight flight cycles, etc., the FAA has determined
that these mitigating factors could be best evaluated through requests for alternative methods of compliance, as
provided for in paragraph (d) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 22,000 flight cycles be extended to 25,000 flight cycles
to inspect the lap joints in areas outside of Stringer 14 since data indicate that cracking in these areas did not occur
until after 25,000 flight cycles. The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this AD,
the FAA not only evaluated the fatigue test data that was provided by the manufacturer, but took into consideration
the size of the test sample: the test results were based upon just one airplane that had no loads and was not pressurized.
Based on this data, the FAA determined that 22,000 flight cycles represented a conservative threshold for initiating
inspections so as to ensure that any cracking initiation would be found in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 3,000 flight cycles to perform the repetitive inspections
be extended to 4,300 flight cycles to coincide with operators' regularly scheduled maintenance periods. The FAA
does not concur. The FAA has determined that the compliance time, as proposed, represents the maximum interval of
time allowable for the affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. In developing this
inspection interval, the FAA evaluated the reliability of the inspection method and the results of fatigue test data.
The FAA found that extending this interval by more than one-third would allow cracks to propagate undetected, which
would adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 723 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910, or $770 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this
action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided
under the caption

stringer number 41; installation of a repair, if necessary; and modification of that stringer. This amendment is
prompted by reports of fatigue cracks in outer wing stringer number 41. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent reduced structural integrity of the wing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49946). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracks in wing stringer
number 41; installation of a repair, if necessary; and modification of that stringer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its members, requests that the FAA include a flow
diagram in the proposal since its provisions are complex. The FAA does not concur. The FAA considers that the requirements
of this AD are presented in a reasonably clear manner in the text of the final rule. In addition, McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10
Service Bulletin 57&hyph;114, Revision 1, dated July 26, 1993, which is referenced in the AD as the appropriate source
of service information, provides corresponding guidance for accomplishment of the actions required by this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA also suggests that, prior to issuance of the final rule, the FAA should verify that the service bulletin will not
create problems for operators, and that accomplishment of the service bulletin should be verified by an operator
before the AD is finalized. One ATA member experienced difficulty accomplishing the permanent repair specified
in the service bulletin because parts listed did not fit, drawings were erroneous, and fastener grip lengths were
inadequate for the repair. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request. The FAA has conveyed these concerns to the
manufacturer, and has verified that the initial problems expressed by the commenter have been corrected in Revision
1 of the service bulletin. Since Revision 1 of the service bulletin was cited in the proposal as the appropriate source
of service information, the FAA finds that no change to the AD is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the FAA allow visual inspection methods to be used in lieu of the proposed eddy current
inspection methods. The commenter indicates that fastener accessibility enables accomplishment of a visual inspection
and provides an equivalent level of crack detection. The FAA does not concur. Based on the results of crack growth analysis,
the FAA has determined that a visual inspection of the stringer cannot provide an acceptable level of crack detection.
In addition, the FAA based the repetitive inspection intervals on the crack growth analysis results based upon the
minimum crack length detectable by eddy current inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also requests that credit be given for general visual inspections accomplished previously. A second
commenter supports the proposed rule, but requests that the AD be revised to state that inspections accomplished
within 1,500 landings prior to the effective date of the AD are acceptable in lieu of the initial inspection. The commenters
provide no justification for these requests. Since the FAA has determined that a visual inspection of the stringer
does not provide an acceptable level of crack detection, as discussed previously, the FAA considers that the requirement
for eddy current inspections is appropriate and credit cannot be extended for general visual inspections accomplished
previously. However, the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' which appears in the ``Compliance'' paragraph
of the final rule, provides credit for operators that have accomplished the required inspection prior to the effective
date of this AD in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 57&hyph;114, Revision 1, dated
July 26, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the first inspection accomplished to comply with this AD be required during the airplane's
next heavy maintenance visit if a general visual inspection has been accomplished prior to the effective date of the
AD. The FAA does not concur. A general visual inspection of the stringer does not provide an acceptable level of crack
detection, as discussed previously. In developing an appropriate initial compliance time for this action, the FAA
considered the safety implications and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the inspection.
In consideration of these items, the FAA has determined that 6,500 total landings or 1,500 landings after the effective
date of the AD, whichever occurs later, represents the maximum interval of time allowable wherein the inspection
can reasonably be accomplished and an acceptable level of safety can be maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter states that the service bulletin cited in the AD specifies that one reason for accomplishing the
actions described in the service bulletin is to prevent unscheduled maintenance downtime for replacement of a cracked
stringer; therefore, the commenter questions the need for this AD. The commenter adds that, to date, stringer 41 cracking
has not impacted its maintenance due to the viable maintenance program currently in place. The commenter states that
imposing an AD at this time would only complicate its maintenance program and would contribute little toward ensuring
that the airplane wing structure is operating in good condition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur. As explained in the preamble of the proposal, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracks
in outer wing stringer number 41 and, in one case, complete failure of the stringer. Such fatigue cracking presents
an unsafe condition in airplanes, since it could eventually lead to failure of the stringer and reduced structural
integrity of the wing. The FAA has determined that this unsafe condition could exist or eventually develop on Model
DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, and that repetitive inspections of the
affected area must be mandated to ensure that safety is not degraded. The appropriate vehicle for mandating such action
to correct an unsafe condition is the airworthiness directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time for accomplishment of the initial inspection specified
in paragraph (b)(1) of the proposal be changed from ``[p]rior to the accumulation of 6,500 total landings, or within
1,500 landings after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later,'' to ``[p]rior to the accumulation of 6,500
total landings, or within one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later.'' The commenter operates
Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;40 series airplanes of non-U.S. registry for training flights for cockpit crews. The commenter
explains that, during one training flight period of a few weeks, the number of flight cycles accumulated may be more
than 1,500 landings. The commenter adds that the proposed inspections and modifications require entry into the fuel
tanks; therefore, the commenter plans to accomplish the initial inspections and the modifications during regularly
scheduled maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Compliance times for AD's are normally based on a parameter related
to failure of a particular component. In this case, fatigue cracking in outer wing stringer number 41 and subsequent
failure of the stringer are undoubtedly related to the number of landings. The FAA has determined, in this case, that
there is no apparent direct relationship between failure of the stringer and calendar time. In light of this, and in
consideration of the average utilization rate of the affected U.S. operators and the practical aspects of orderly
inspections of the U.S. fleet during regular maintenance periods, the FAA established the compliance times specified
in this AD. The FAA maintains that those compliance times are appropriate. However, the FAA would consider a request
for adjustment of the compliance time, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this AD, provided that,
for example, continued operational safety of the airplane could be assured until the required action is accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that, in order for the AD requirements to align with the actions described in the service bulletin,
accomplishment of the preventative modification should be considered optional, and that operators should be permitted
to accomplish repetitive inspections at intervals of 4,000 landings in lieu of the preventative modification. The
FAA does not concur. The degree of assurance necessary as to the adequacy of inspections needed to maintain the safety
of the aging transport airplane fleet, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous
repetitive inspections, has caused the FAA to place less emphasis on repetitive inspections and more emphasis on
design improvements and material replacement. Thus, in lieu of its previous position of continual inspection, and
repair or modification on condition if cracks are found, the FAA has decided to require, whenever practicable, airplane
modifications necessary to remove the source of the particular aging phenomena.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 426 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the
affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 121 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series
airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 13.6 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10
and &hyph;15 series airplanes will cost approximately $586 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes is estimated to be $161,414,
or $1,334 per airplane.

The FAA estimates that 148 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military)
airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 13.6 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30
and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes will cost approximately $1,420 per airplane.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40
series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes is estimated to be $320,864, or $2,168 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $482,278. The total cost
impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action,
and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B
series airplanes, that requires an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves, and further inspections and repair,
if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report of delamination between the composite structure and the aluminum
foil on the elevator cove on a Model SAAB SF340B series airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
jamming of the aileron or elevator.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5361). That action proposed to require an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to
verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint or
expanded aluminum foil, that action proposed to require a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to
detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed visual inspections
and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. Accomplishment of the permanent repair
terminates the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 152 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20
work hours per airplane to accomplish the inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $167,200, or $1,000 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this
action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided
under the caption

 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T94&hyph;10&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of certain Airbus Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes by individual telegrams.
This AD requires a detailed visual inspection to detect cracks, delamination, or discoloration of the bus bar of certain
aft fixed side cockpit windows; and deactivation of the window heating system and repetitive detailed visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report
of fracture of a fixed cockpit window that led to electrical arcing in the bus bar area of the window heating system on
a Model A300 series airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent decompression of the fuselage
during flight due to failure of a window.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 3, 1994, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51, which is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie
Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes. That action was prompted by a report of fracture of a fixed cockpit
window on the right-hand aft side of the cockpit of a Model A300 series airplane. Embrittlement of the fixed cockpit
window and simultaneous rupture of the two main plies of the window have been attributed to electrical arcing in the
bus bar area of the window 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in decompression of the fuselage during flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the subject windows installed on Model A300&hyph;600 and A310 series airplanes are similar in design to those
on Model A300 series airplanes, the FAA has determined that these airplanes are also subject to the addressed unsafe
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus Industrie has issued All Operators Telex (AOT) 56&hyph;01, Revision 1, dated April 29, 1994, that describes
procedures for a detailed visual inspection to detect discoloration (black or brown burnt spots) of the bus bar of
certain aft fixed side windows; and either deactivation of the window heating system coupled with repetitive detailed
visual inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for France, classified this AOT as mandatory and issued French telegraphic airworthiness directive N 94&hyph;104&hyph;160(B),
dated April 26, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These airplane models are manufactured in France and are type certificated for operation in the United States under
the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered
in the United States, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51 to require a detailed visual inspection
to detect cracks, delamination, or discoloration (black or brown burnt spots) of the bus bar of certain aft fixed side
windows; and either deactivation of the window heating system and repetitive detailed visual inspections, or replacement
of the window with a modified window, if necessary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on May 3, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of certain Airbus Model A300,
A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an amendment to &sect;39.13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective as to all persons.

Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;63&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage
upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. This amendment also requires modification of certain lap joints and inspections
of modified lap joints. This amendment is prompted by a structural review of Model 747 series airplanes. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to prevent rapid decompression of the airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe
loads, due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking and corrosion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8875). That action proposed to require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks
and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. That action also proposed
to require modification of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that proposed inspection requirements be revised. This commenter requests that, if the visual
inspection [proposed in paragraph (a)(1) of the AD] reveals any evidence of corrosion, operators should be allowed
to perform a low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspection of the entire length of the lap joint to determine if corrosion
exceeds 10% of the skin thickness. If this LFEC inspection is accomplished, the commenter also requests that the visual
inspection repetitive interval specified in paragraph (a)(1) be extended from the proposed 2,000 landings to 3,000
landings so that the interval corresponds with other major structural inspection intervals. The FAA cannot concur
with this request, since the commenter provided neither specific inspection instructions nor data to justify the
effectiveness of the proposed procedures. Under the provisions of paragraph (i) of the final rule, however, operators
may apply for the approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD, or adjustment of the compliance time,
if sufficient justification is presented to the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that proposed paragraph (a) be clarified with regard to the inspections and inspection interval
required after a lap joint has been modified. These commenters request that, for lap joints that have been modified
by either the full or partial modification procedures described in the referenced Boeing service bulletin, operators
be allowed a period of time during which no inspections are required for those lap joints. The referenced Boeing service
bulletin, as well as proposed paragraph (f), state that post-modification inspections are to start at 10,000 cycles,
7,000 cycles, or 5,000 cycles after modification of the skin lap joints, depending upon the type of modification that
has been accomplished. However, as worded in paragraph (a) of the proposal, the same inspections meant to detect cracks
and corrosion in unmodified skin lap joints would be required to be performed on modified skin lap joints until the
inspections specified in proposed paragraph (f) begin. The FAA concurs that clarification of this requirement is
necessary. It was not the FAA's intent to require that the initial-type of inspections of unmodified lap joints be
performed on modified lap joints. Accordingly, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) have been revised to indicate that the
inspections of the specified lap joints are to continue at repetitive intervals only until the lap joints are modified
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the compliance time for accomplishing the ``full'' modification on certain lap
joints, as specified in paragraph (b)(2), be extended from the proposed 15 months to 18 months. Additionally, these
commenters request that the compliance time for a similar requirement specified in paragraph (c)(2) be extended
from the proposed 30 months to 36 months. The commenters state that, by extending these compliance times, operators
would be able to accomplish the modification during a scheduled maintenance interval (``C'' check), and thereby
eliminate the need to schedule special times for the accomplishment of this modification, at additional expense.
The FAA concurs. It was the FAA's intent that the modification be performed at a main base during regularly scheduled
maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Accordingly,
the final rule has been revised to specify compliance times as requested by the commenters. The FAA has determined
that this extension will not adversely affect safety since the affected lap joints will be subject to repetitive inspections
in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that paragraph (e) be revised to extend the compliance time for accomplishment of the ``full''
modification of the specified skin lap joints from the proposed 1,000 cycles (for airplanes that have accumulated
nearly or more than 20,000 total flight cycles) to 4 years after the effective date of the final rule. These commenters
consider the proposed compliance time to be too short and not consistent with compliance times provided for similar
actions in other AD's pertaining to aging aircraft issues. The FAA does not concur. The 1,000 flight cycle compliance
time is consistent with the mandatory modification of a lap joint that has been found to have corrosion or cracking,
as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this AD. Cold bonded lap joints such as these have a history of numerous findings
of fatigue cracks and corrosion. In light of this, and the fact that fatigue cracking is cycle-related, the FAA has
determined that modification of these lap joints cannot be delayed any further than 1,000 flight cycles, especially
on those airplanes that already have accumulated 20,000 flight cycles, without compromising safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the applicability of proposed paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3) be revised to clarify
that it is the ``lap joint,'' rather than the ``airplane,'' on which the particular modification has been accomplished.
The FAA concurs and has revised wording of the final rule to clarify this point.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requests that all references in the rule to ``landings'' be changed to ``cycles.'' The FAA concurs that
the reference should be revised. The FAA has reviewed the applicable service information related to this action and
finds that the majority of references to recommended compliance times are stated in ``flight cycles.'' Although
the FAA normally uses the terms ``landings'' and ``flight cycles'' interchangeably, the FAA considers that it is
appropriate in this case to change the verbiage of the AD to match that of the cited service bulletins. Therefore, in
this final rule, the FAA has substituted the term ``flight cycles'' for the term ``landings.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter, a non-U.S. operator, requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision specifying
that pressurization cycles of 2.0 psi or less need not be counted as a flight cycle when determining the number of flight
cycles relative to the proposed compliance thresholds. This commenter states that a pressurization cycle of 2.0
psi or less is a typical pressure used during flight training, and causes little fatigue damage of the kind addressed
by this AD action. The FAA does not concur. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to include various provisions in
an AD applicable to a single operator's unique use of an affected airplane. Paragraph (i) of this AD provides for the
approval of alternative methods of compliance to address these types of unique circumstances. Further, this commenter
does not compile data for each of its airplanes so that an individual airplane's pressurization cycles could be determined;
instead, it uses a fleet average to calculate the equivalent number of pressurization cycles. The FAA does not consider
it appropriate to use approximations for determining compliance with this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 116 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required inspections will entail 100 work hours per airplane per inspection, at an average labor rate of $55 per
work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $638,000, or $5,500 per airplane, per
inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required ``full'' modification will entail approximately 96 work hours for each 200-inch length of uncracked
and uncorroded lap joint, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary
for gaining access and closing up.) There are 100 lap joint sections per airplane, each with a length of 200 inches.
The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $61,248,000, or $528,000 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection following modification will entail approximately 56
work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $357,280, or $3,080 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is expected to be $62,243,280,
or $536,580 per airplane. This total cost figure includes the inspections and modification, for the first year of
the average five-year inspection cycle. Additionally, the total cost figure indicated is based on assumptions that
no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those
actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety
is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this
level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would
be redundant and unnecessary.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action revokes the Class D airspace area at Victorville, CA due to the closure of George AFB. An operational airport
traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace. The airport traffic control tower is closed, and, therefore,
the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area.

This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revokes the Class D airspace area at Victorville,
George AFB, CA. An operational airport traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace. The airport traffic
control tower is closed. Consequently, the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area. Because this action is a minor
technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure
under U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action revokes the Class D airspace area and establishes a Class E airspace area at Imperial County Airport and
modifies the El Centro NAF Class D airspace area. The airspace at Imperial County Airport was inadvertently classified
as Class D airspace. Imperial County Airport does not have an airport traffic control tower which is required for Class
D airspace, and, therefore, the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revokes the Class D airspace area and
establishes Class E airspace at Imperial County Airport, CA. The El Centro NAF, CA, Class D airspace area description
is modified to reflect this change. An operational airport traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace.
Imperial County Airport does not have an airport traffic control tower. Consequently, the FAA is revoking this Class
D airspace area. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested,
I find that notice and public procedure under U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

 The amendments contained in this document are being published as interim regulations to implement certain statutory
amendments to the Customs laws regarding administrative exemptions. These statutory amendments are contained
in the Customs modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. Also, the
interim regulations clarify the procedures for shipments brought into the United States by express consignment
operators or carriers and make clear that all shipments carried into the United States by express consignment operators
or carriers are required to be entered, unless specifically exempt from entry. These interim regulations also implement
the Customs modernization provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act exempting from
entry certain merchandise (undeliverable shipments, railway freight locomotives and cars, and instruments of
international traffic).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law Public Law 103&hyph;182, the North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act (107 Stat. 2057). Title VI of this Act, popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act (the Act)
amended certain Customs laws. Section 651 of the Act amended section 321, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C.
1321).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before its amendment by the Act, section 321 authorized administrative exemptions from duty and taxes on articles
such as gifts and personal and household goods, and in certain other situations. Specifically, section 321 authorized
the Secretary of the Treasury, in order to avoid expense and inconvenience to the Government disproportionate to
the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected, to disregard a difference of less than $10 between the duty
actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited. On the same basis, section 321 authorized the Secretary
to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $50 in the case of bona fide gifts ($100 if the
gift was from certain island possessions) sent from persons in foreign countries to persons in the United States.
Section 321 authorized the Secretary to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $25 in
the case of personal or household articles accompanying the traveler. In all other cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if not a bona fide gift sent from a person in a foreign country to a person in the United States or a personal or household
article accompanying a traveler), the Secretary was authorized to admit free of duty and tax any article the value
of which was less than $5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the last three cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bona fide gifts, personal or household articles, and all other cases), the exemptions were subject to the condition
that the aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipment of articles imported by one person on one day could not
exceed the authorized amount. Also, the exemptions in these cases were not to be granted in any case in which merchandise
covered by a single order or contract was forwarded in separate lots to secure the benefit of the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary was authorized to prescribe regulations to implement these provisions. Section 321 specifically
authorized the Secretary to diminish any of the dollar amounts referred to above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 651 of the Act increased the dollar amounts described and, instead of setting maximum dollar amounts below
which the Secretary was authorized to make the exemptions applicable, authorized the Secretary to make the exemptions
applicable to an amount to be specified in regulations, but not less than a stated amount. That is, the amended section
321 now provides minimum dollar amounts for the exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the difference between duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited, the dollar amount
was increased to a minimum of $20. Also, this provision was changed to authorize Customs to apply the exemption to the
total of duties, fees, and taxes, instead of only duties and taxes, as had been the case. In the case of bona fide gifts,
personal or household articles, and all other cases, the dollar amounts were respectively increased to $100 ($200,
if the gift is from one of the named island possessions), $200, and $200, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 651 removed from &sect;321 the specific authorization to, by regulation, diminish any of the dollar amounts
specified in the provision. Section 651 retained the specific authorization in section 321 for regulations to prescribe
exceptions to any exemption whenever the Secretary finds such action is consistent with the purpose of the provisions
or is necessary to protect the revenue or to prevent unlawful importations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision in the Customs Regulations containing the authorization to disregard a difference of less than $10
between the duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited is found in 19 CFR 159.6. The provisions
in the Customs Regulations pertaining to the administrative exemption for bona fide gifts are found in 19 CFR 10.152
and 145.32 and the provision for personal or household articles is found in 19 CFR 148.51 (see also &sect;&sect;148.12,
148.64). The provisions in the Customs Regulations pertaining to the $5 administrative exemption for all other articles
are found in 19 CFR 10.151 and 145.31. Conditions for the exemptions provided for in 19 CFR 10.151 and 10.152 are currently
found in 19 CFR 10.153.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions pertaining to the administrative exemptions under section 321 are also found in part 128 of the Customs
Regulations, which relates to express consignments. Section 128.24(d) of that part refers to low value shipments
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
shipments valued at $5 or less) and provides that such shipments must be segregated from shipments valued at more than
$5 when the special informal entry procedures provided for in part 128 are used. This provision was intended to cover
articles which could be administratively exempted from duties and taxes under section 321(a)(2)(C) (see T.D. 89&hyph;53,
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 8, 1989 (54 FR 19561)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These interim regulations conform the Customs Regulations to the changes made to section 321 by section 651 of the
Act. In addition, the interim regulations clarify entry procedures applicable to merchandise subject to section
321. The dollar amounts currently provided for in 19 CFR 10.151 through 10.153, 145.31, 145.32, 148.12, 148.51, 148.64
and 159.6 are changed to the minimums provided for in the amended section 321. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim regulations amend part 143 to clarify the procedures for entries of shipments qualifying for the administrative
exemptions in section 321(a)(2). Shipments covered in section 321(a)(2) are included in the merchandise which may
be entered under the procedures provided for by regulation under 19 U.S.C. 1498. That provision authorizes the Secretary
of the Treasury to prescribe rules and regulations for the declaration and entry of the merchandise described in the
section. Entries which may be provided for by regulation under section 1498 are distinguished from entries which
are required to be filed under 19 U.S.C. 1484 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
formal entries). As authorized by section 1498, these amendments provide that the person who may make entry of shipments
covered by section 321(a)(2) is the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated
by one of these persons, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. Under the same authority, an amendment to part
143 makes it clear that the person who may make entry of other merchandise (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
merchandise not qualifying for the administrative exemptions in section 321(a)(2)) which qualifies for informal
entry is the owner or purchaser of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee
of the merchandise, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A corresponding amendment to part 111, concerning Customs brokers, is added to the list of transactions for which
a broker's license is not required. The new provision provides that a person entering merchandise qualifying for
and entered under the informal entry procedures authorized by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19 U.S.C. 1498 is not required to be licensed as a broker unless required to be so licensed by regulations issued under
the authority of section 1498. A reference to the provision included in part 143 is included in the new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also under the authority of 19 U.S.C. 1498, amendments are made to part 143 to clearly provide the procedures for entries
of the merchandise covered in section 321(a)(2). Shipments of such merchandise may be entered by presenting the bill
of lading (or a manifest listing each bill of lading) or other document used to file or support entry. Manifest information
is required consisting of the country of origin of the merchandise, shipper name, address and country, ultimate consignee
name and address, specific description of the merchandise, quantity, and value. Cross references are provided to
section &sect;&sect;148.12 and 148.62 to make it clear that entry by oral declaration continues to be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No amendment to the regulations is being promulgated at this time to implement the new subsection (a)(3) of section
321, added by section 651 of the Act. This provision allows Customs to waive the collection of duties, fees, and taxes
due on entered merchandise when such duties, fees, or taxes are less than $20, in order to avoid expense and inconvenience
to the Government disproportionate to the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected. Regulations implementing
this provision are being delayed pending an analysis of the expense and inconvenience to the Government in view of
the revenue involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 159.6, authorizing Customs to disregard a difference of less than $10 (now $20 under the amended section 321(a)(1))
between duties deposited and duties actually due on an entry, is amended to authorize Customs to apply the exemption
to the total of duties, fees, and taxes, as provided for in section 321(a)(1), as amended by section 651 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs also is making amendments to the Customs Regulations in part 128 relating to express consignments. These
amendments are intended to make it clear that all shipments carried into the United States by express consignment
operators and carriers are required to be entered, unless specifically exempt from entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, a 3-tier approach applies to such shipments. That is, shipments valued in excess of $1250 are required
to be formally entered, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1484 in parts 141, 142, and 143 (except subpart C) of the Customs
Regulations. Shipments valued between $200 and $1250 may be entered under the informal entry procedures, as provided
for under 19 U.S.C. 1498 (unless the shipments consist of merchandise which may not be entered under those procedures).
These procedures consist of the filing of a Customs Form 3461, either modified to cover all importations under the
special procedures for express consignment operator or carrier importations or all such importations on a daily
or flight basis, and the advance filing of the manifest information provided for in 19 CFR 128.21. This information
consists of the country of origin, shipper name, address and country, ultimate consignee name and address, specific
description of the merchandise and the tariff classification of the merchandise, quantity, shipping weight, and
value. An entry summary (Customs Form 7501) and estimated duties are required to be filed with Customs within 10 days
of release of these shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third tier is for shipments valued at $200 or less. These shipments also may be entered under the informal entry
procedures, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1498 (unless the shipments consist of merchandise which may not be entered
under those procedures). The procedures for these shipments are the same as those for the second-tier shipments (valued
between $200 and $1250), except that the tariff classification of the merchandise is not required for the shipments
and no entry summary or estimated duties is required to be filed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An amendment to 19 CFR 101.1, adding a definition of ``shipment'', makes it clear that the monetary exemption for third-tier
shipments is based on the bill of lading or other evidence used to file or support entry, or oral declaration when applicable.
For example, if the document used to file or support entry is an individual bill of lading to the ultimate consignee
in the United States, the monetary limitation is applied on the basis of the value of the shipment on the individual
bill of lading. This is so whether the document used to file or support entry is itself the bill of lading or an advance
manifest, as described in 19 CFR 128.21, listing each of the individual bills of lading. On the other hand, if the document
used to file or support entry is a master bill of lading (as opposed to each individual bill of lading), the monetary
limitation is applied on the basis of the total value of the shipments on the master bill of lading. The same is true of
the application of the monetary limitation in section 321(a)(2) for other importations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those not involving an express consignment entity). This is so because the definition of ``shipment'' is for general
purposes in chapter I of title 19 of the CFR, unless the context of the term requires a different meaning (see 19 CFR 101.1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is true generally under these amendments, the person who may make entry for the shipments valued between $200 and
$1250 which may be entered under the informal entry procedures is the owner or purchaser of the shipment or, when appropriately
designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the shipment, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641.
The person who may make entry for the shipments valued $200 or less which may be entered under the informal entry procedures
is the owner, purchaser, or consignee or, when appropriately designated by one of these persons, a Customs broker
licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. As discussed above, the authority for this distinction is that these entries are made
under 19 U.S.C. 1498 and the Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to prescribe rules and regulations
for the declaration and entry of such shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments are also made to part 141. Section 141.4 is amended to clarify that shipments subject to the administrative
exemptions under &sect;321(a)(2) must be entered under special informal entry procedures for lower value shipments.
Only merchandise specifically exempt from entry (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
so-called intangibles, under General Note 13 (formerly General Note 4), HTSUS, and certain vessels) is exempt from
all forms of entry. Also, a conforming amendment to the citation of the General Note in &sect;141.4 is necessary because
of the redesignation of the General Note (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General Note 4, HTSUS, the predecessor to General Note 13, was redesignated as General Note 13; see Presidential Proclamation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act amended General Note 4 (now General Note 13) by adding
other articles which are exempt from entry (section 681 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The newly added articles are articles
which are returned as undeliverable to the United States within 45 days of their departure from the United States.
The articles may not have left the custody of either the carrier or foreign customs service during that time. The departure
from the United States of articles for which the exemption is granted may not be treated as satisfying any requirement
for exportation in order to receive a benefit from, or meet an obligation to, the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment to &sect;141.4 implements this provision. The amendment requires the person claiming the exemption
to certify that the merchandise complies with the provision. In addition, the amendment requires the person claiming
the exemption to provide, upon request by Customs, any evidence necessary to support the claim.

Section 681 of the Act also added a provision to the tariff schedule exempting from entry and release requirements
railway locomotives (provided for in headings 8601 and 8602, HTSUS) and railway freight cars (provided for in heading
8606, HTSUS) on which no duty is owed (Additional U.S. Note 1, Chapter 86, HTSUS). Also, section 681 of the Act provided
for the addition of a Note to Chapter 99, HTSUS, under which certain Canadian railway freight cars provided duty-free
treatment in subheadings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9905.86.05 and 9905.86.10, HTSUS, are exempt from entry and release requirements. The railway freight cars provided
for in subheading 9905.86.05, HTSUS, are those produced before July 1, 1991, or if entered after July 1, 1994, produced
not less than 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years before the date of importation, and provided for in heading 8606, HTSUS. The railway freight cars provided for
in subheading 9905.86.10, HTSUS, are those imported for temporary use in transportation in the United States and
certified by the importer to be exported within 1 year from the date of importation and provided for in heading 8606,
HTSUS. In the case of both Notes (to be added to chapter 86 and 99, HTSUS), the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized
by regulation to establish appropriate reporting requirements and to require that a bond be posted to ensure compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to &sect;141.4 implements these provisions. In the case of railway locomotives and freight cars which
are exempt from entry on the basis that no duty is owed on them and they are classified in headings 8601, 8602, or 8606,
HTSUS (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, without reference to subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS), no special evidentiary requirement is imposed
because duty-free treatment is not conditioned on any special condition (other than duty-free status because of
origin). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of railway freight cars which are exempt from entry by virtue of subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS,
because there are conditions other than the absence of duty being owed on the freight cars, the amendment contains
special evidentiary requirements. The requirements, concerning the time of production of the freight car and the
duration of the stay in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States of the freight car, shall be met by a certification (documentary or electronic), subject to Customs
verification. In the case of the requirement to export the freight car within 1 year from the date of importation, in
subheading 9905.86.10, HTSUS, the amendment specifically provides that a freight car admitted into the United States
under this provision which is not exported within the 1 year period becomes subject to entry and the payment of any applicable
duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As authorized by the statutory provision, the amendment provides that locomotives and freight cars described in
Additional U.S. Note 1 of Chapter 86, HTSUS, and freight cars described in subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS,
may be released only after the importer has filed a bond on Customs Form 301, containing either the basic importation
and entry conditions (19 CFR 113.62) or the international carrier bond conditions (19 CFR 113.64). Amendments to
19 CFR 123.12 are added concerning the entry of foreign locomotives and equipment in international traffic, to add
references to the provisions implementing these provisions.

Instruments of International Traffic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 681 of the Act added a provision to the tariff schedule exempting from formal entry procedures instruments
of international traffic, such as containers, lift vans, rail cars and locomotives, truck cabs and trailers, etc.
The provision also provided for the periodic reporting and payment of fees associated with the importation of such
instruments of international traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption from entry for instruments of international traffic is already provided for in the Customs Regulations
(see 19 CFR 10.41a). There are no fees associated with the importation of instruments of international traffic. Therefore,
no substantive amendment to the Customs Regulations is necessary to implement this provision. However, to alert
the public to the exemption from entry for instruments of international traffic, a provision is added referring to
this exemption from entry and 19 CFR 10.41a in the list of exceptions from the general rule in &sect;141.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Customs is promulgating on an interim basis amendments as described above and set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Delayed Effective Date and Public Comment Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency intends that these interim regulations become effective on the 45th day following the date of publication,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 15 days after the close of the comment period. The agency believes it has good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1) and (3)
of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) to promulgate interim regulations because the regulations
provide an immediate benefit to both the Government and the public by increasing exemptions which already exist.
These interim regulations are intended to implement Congressional intent embodied in 19 U.S.C. 1321, as amended,
that these exemptions, when granted, should exist at statutory minimums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, existing rights and obligations are not otherwise changed. The agency believes the public wants these
new statutory minimums to become effective as soon as possible as the public should benefit from the efficiencies
and savings resulting therefrom. In addition, the agency does not believe the public needs time to conform its conduct
so as to avoid violation of these regulations. The due and timely execution of the agency's responsibilities would
be unnecessarily impeded by a time consuming notice and comment period. The agency believes such delay is unnecessary
because it does not expect the public to object to the regulations being promulgated as they merely provide the relief
that Congress intended.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even though, based on the discussion set forth above, Customs believes the amendments in this document may be promulgated
on an interim basis and could be effective immediately, Customs is providing a 45-day delayed effective date, with
a 30 day comment period preceding that effective date. This represents a practical compromise between the need for
temporal urgency and the desirability of public participation in the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the spirit of the APA, the agency is soliciting public comment regarding its decision to promulgate these interim
regulations and in delaying their effective date only for that period of time necessary to review any relevant comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding that decision. Unless the comments show that there exists good cause for not making the regulations effective
on an interim basis, the regulations will become effective on an interim basis on the 45th day following the date of
publication.

Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, the agency hereby solicits comments on both the substance of these regulations and their intended
effective date. The comments should clearly state whether they address the substance of the interim rule or the agency's
determination to make the rule effective on an interim basis. If, based on the comments, good cause is shown that the
regulations should not become effective on an interim basis, a document will be issued withdrawing the interim regulations
before their effective date. If no such good cause is shown, the interim regulations will go into effect. The agency
will then be able to gain experience with the interim regulation, fully consider substantive comments, and decide
whether the interim regulation needs amendment before its promulgation as a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably in triplicate) that are timely submitted to Customs.
All such comments received from the public pursuant to this notice of rulemaking will be available for public inspection
in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

covered by a single order or contract and that it was sent separately for the express purpose of securing free entry
therefor or of avoiding compliance with any pertinent law or regulation. Merchandise subject to this exemption shall

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is issuing revised Forest Highway (FH) Program regulations to conform to the requirements of the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Section 1032 of the ISTEA amends, among other things, 23 United
States Code (U.S.C.) 202 and 204 to combine the FH category with the public lands highway category. The revised regulation
will ensure expeditious and proper allocation of funds to provide public road access to the National Forest System
(NFS).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 18, 1991, the President signed the ISTEA, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914. Section 1032 of the
ISTEA amends 23 U.S.C. 202 and 204 by, among other things, incorporating new planning provisions, including metropolitan
and statewide transportation plan requirements; establishing management systems provisions, including highway
safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway pavements; adding and revising definitions for key
terms relating to the Federal Lands Highway Program; and modifying existing allocation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of the Federal Lands Highway Program is to provide public road funding to serve the Federal lands
outside State or local government responsibility. Typically, the facilities serve recreational travel and tourism,
protect and enhance natural resources, provide sustained economic development in rural areas, and provide needed
transportation for Native Americans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA's partnership with the Forest Service (FS) began in 1916 when the Federal-Aid Road Act appropriated funds
for the construction and maintenance of roads and trails serving the national forests. There are currently over 25,000
miles of FHs, on State and local transportation systems, serving 191 million acres of national forest lands in 40 States
plus Puerto Rico. These roads connect to the approximately 370,000 miles of forest development roads that are under
the jurisdiction of the FS. The fiscal year 1994 (FY 94) authorization for FHs was $113 million. On October 5, 1993,
the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 51794). The following discussion addresses comments to the NPRM which were provided to the FHWA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule was developed by an interagency task force of the FHWA and the FS. The FHWA and the FS considered the comments
received to the Docket for the regulation in developing the revisions to the NPRM for the final rule.

Relationship to Interim Guidance Issued December 26, 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 26, 1991, the FHWA issued interim guidance to aid States and the FS in complying with the new legislative
requirements. The guidance was developed in consultation with FS headquarters staff and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 57 FR 14880 on April 23, 1992. This interim guidance is superseded by this regulation.

Written Comments Received to the Docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters submitted 29 comments to the Docket regarding the NPRM. One Federal agency and five State highway agencies
(SHAs) commented on the NPRM. The majority of commenters offered specific suggestions for revisions. Some also offered
minor editorial corrections and text enhancements. Most of the significant comments were directed at &sect;660.105_Planning
and route designation_and at &sect;660.107_Allocations. All comments were considered and have been accommodated
to the extent practical. In response to these comments, the FHWA has developed a final rule. A summary of the specific
responses to comments raised on individual sections of the NPRM follows:

One commenter expressed the need to better describe the importance of the FH Program for access to and management of
the NFS and its role as an integral part of the Federal Lands Highway Program.

This section was expanded to better describe how the FH Program enhances local, regional, and national benefits of
FHs funded under the Public Lands Highway category of the coordinated Federal Lands Highway Program. The FH Program
provides safe and adequate transportation access to and through National Forest System (NFS) lands for visitors,
recreationists, resource users, and others which is not met by other transportation programs, assists rural and
community economic development, and promotes tourism and travel.

One commenter suggested that the definition of ``public authority'' be modified so that a public authority would
be required to meet all authorities noted in the NPRM definition by changing the ``or'' condition to an ``and'' condition
regarding the public authority's authority to finance, build, operate, ``or'' maintain toll or toll-free facilities.

Because this definition is a title 23, U.S.C., definition, it was not revised, even though the ``and'' condition would
make it more restrictive. Regulations may clarify or explain, but cannot revise, a statutory definition.

Another commenter suggested revising the definition of ``forest road'' to include a road which provides ``access
to'' the NFS since many FHs in some States do not meet the criteria of a forest road as indicated by the proposed definition.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is also a title 23, U.S.C., definition and was not revised in the final rule. The present wording for the definition
of ``forest road,'' as stated in 23 U.S.C. 101, is: ``The term forest road or trail means a road or trail wholly or partly
within, or adjacent to, and serving the NFS and which is necessary for the protection, administration, and utilization
of the NFS and the use and development of its resources.'' This definition is adequate because a road which provides
access to the NFS is considered to be serving the NFS. Also, the definition for FH allows for roads providing access
to the NFS since it refers to forest roads, the definition of which allows access to the NFS.

Similar wording was used in the definition of Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in this section. Therefore,
the phrase was added to the end of the definition to clarify it. Also, a definition for ``metropolitan transportation
plan'' was added to this section because the term is used in &sect;660.105 along with the term ``statewide transportation
plan,'' which is also defined in this regulation in &sect;660.103.

Some minor wording changes were made to paragraph (a) of this section to reflect the fact that the FS will provide resource
planning and related transportation information to the ``appropriate'' MPO in accordance with part 450 of this title.
This clarification was needed because there are numerous MPOs within some States and the FS should direct the information
only to the MPO needing the information.

Two of the SHAs felt that paragraph (b) should be clarified to delineate the reporting responsibilities for management
information systems. One felt the final rule should specify that the State would be responsible for pavement, bridge,
and safety management systems where the FH is also a State highway and that cities and counties would be responsible
for those management systems where FHs are under city or county jurisdiction. The FS would then be responsible for
those management systems on all other applicable roads.

Title 23, U.S.C., 303 requires the States to develop and implement systems for managing highway pavements of Federal-aid
highways (pavement management systems), bridges on and off Federal-aid highways (bridge management systems),
and highway safety for all public roads (safety management systems). The results of bridge management systems and
safety management systems on all FHs and results of pavement management systems for FHs on Federal-aid highways are
to be provided by the SHAs for consideration in the development of programs under &sect;660.109 of this part. The FHWA
will provide appropriate pavement management results for FHs which are not Federal-aid highways. The last two sentences
in paragraph (b) were reworded to clarify these procedures and be more in concert with 23 U.S.C. 204(a).

One commenter recommended that paragraph (c)(1) be clarified by adding the word ``forest'' before the word ``roads''
to be more consistent with previous definitions and to clarify candidate roads for nomination. This would clarify
the fact that the SHA and the FS will nominate ``forest'' roads, not just any roads, for FH designation. The FH definition
also references forest roads.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter noted the restrictiveness of the NPRM in that it limits the funding of the allocated portion of the Public
Lands Highway Program exclusively to FHs. The commenter further pointed out that the 1991 ISTEA amended 23 U.S.C.
202 by striking the subsection that dealt with FHs as a part of the Public Lands Highway Program with the result that,
according to the commenter, one-third of the allocated program may be spent on highways other than FHs. Under this
broader definition of Public Lands Highways, the States would have the flexibility to spend the allocated portion
of PLH funds on all kinds of highways such as the Bureau of Land Management roads and even Indian Reservation Roads.
The ``equal consideration'' language of the ISTEA, in the commenter's view, would allow for at least half of the allocated
funds to be spent on such roads while the NPRM language restricts the allocated portion to FHs only.

The conference report on ISTEA states that ``Sixty-six percent of the public lands highway account shall be allocated
to the Forest Service regional offices for use in 41 States based on the FH criteria. The remaining 34 percent shall
be allocated by the Secretary based on national competition for other forest or public lands highways.'' (H.R. Conf.
Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 331 (1991).) Therefore, the interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 202(b) is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Thirty-four percent of the public lands highway funds shall be allocated in a discretionary manner, giving preference
to States that contain at least 3 percent of the total public lands in the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sixty-six percent of the public lands highway funds are to be allocated to the FS Regions in accordance with section
134 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, 101
Stat. 132, 173). Section 134 pertained to the allocation of FH funds, which is part of the Public Lands Highway category.
Therefore, the language of this section was not changed.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the SHAs took exception to the fact that this section requires the allocation of Public Lands Highway Funds by
FS Region, citing an apparent inconsistency with section 134 of the STURAA which allocates ``for expenditure in each
State.'' It was suggested that, for some States which have more than one FS Region, allocation by FS Region potentially
creates difficulties, such as competition or conflicts between States, and that FH funds should continue to be allocated
as outlined in the STURAA. Also, because the ISTEA requires that all FS projects be included in each State's ``Statewide
Transportation Improvement Program'' (STIP), allocation of funds by State would make it easier for each State to
project available funding and projects for inclusion in its STIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM may have given the appearance that the allocation method is being changed. Actually, the NPRM proposed to
continue with the same FH allocation method which has been in existence since FY 85. If FH funds were to be allocated
to the States, 34 States would have their ``hold harmless'' funds reduced by an aggregate total of approximately $90
million per year (based on FY 94 allocation amounts). This represents nearly 85 percent of the total FY 94 FH funds allocation.
The regulation will continue with the allocation in its present form.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the word ``elements,'' used in the NPRM to state that the allocation of funds for FHs uses
values based on relative transportation needs of the various elements of the NFS, should be replaced with the word
``resources.'' The commenter pointed out that the word ``element'' is used in the definition of renewable resources
and could be construed to limit allocations based on renewable resources only. The commenter also believes the term
``resources'' was defined to include both renewable and nonrenewable resources and is more appropriate to use in
defining the allocation process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This wording was carried forward from the previous wording of the existing regulation. However, the sentence was
clarified by deleting the entire phrase ``the various elements of,'' thereby eliminating the need for referring
to either ``resources'' or ``elements.'' It now refers only to ``using values based on relative transportation needs
of the NFS.''

One commenter proposed that a seventh FH project selection criterion should be added to the existing six criteria
in paragraph (a) of this section. The new criterion, which would read: ``The results for forest highways from the pavement,
bridge, and safety management systems'' is needed to comply with &sect;660.105(b) of this part, which discusses
the management systems required under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135. It would also have to be consistent with any changes made
in 23 U.S.C. 105.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

with the FS and the State Highway Agency (SHA) to jointly select the projects which will be included in the programs.

Under current procedures, the State represents the interests of the cooperators. The program meetings are always
open to interested cooperators who may wish to attend. The States may invite cooperators to the meetings, if they wish.
Thus, there is no need to change the wording of the NPRM.

The previous commenter also called attention to paragraph (a) of the NPRM which stated that the FS and the SHA will ``jointly
select the projects which will be included in the programs for the current fiscal year and at least the next 4 years.''
The commenter recommended that, since the projects selected will ultimately be added to the STIP, the planning and
selection of FH projects should cover the same timeframe as the STIP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, at least 5 years are needed to identify early environmental and other preliminary engineering required
to ensure meeting the schedule to advance a project to construction. The proposed FH timeframe is consistent with
this since the TIP generally shows 3 years of the 5-year FH program. Thus, there is no need to change the wording of the
NPRM.

One commenter requested that, in paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``recommended,'' as used in the first sentence,
``The recommended program will be prepared by the FHWA and concurred in by the FS and the SHA,'' should be replaced with
the term ``selected.'' This would more accurately reflect the current procedure, as stated in paragraph (a), that
the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA will ``jointly select the projects,'' not just recommend them. One of the SHAs felt the
second sentence should be revised to read, ``The FHWA will approve the program `only when there is concurrence by the
FS and the SHA.''' Otherwise, the FHWA could conceivably approve the program without waiting for concurrence by the
other two agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A review of this section indicated that the wording of the NPRM may still create some confusion, even with the recommended
word changes, because the first two sentences of paragraph (b) state that ``The recommended program will be prepared
by the FHWA and concurred in by the FS and the SHA'' and that ``The FHWA will approve the program.'' This would make it
appear that the FHWA simply prepares and approves its own program. Consequently, the wording of the first sentence
of this paragraph was revised to read: ``The recommended program will be prepared and approved by the FHWA with concurrence
by the FS and the SHA.'' The second sentence was deleted.

One commenter pointed out that the term ``incorporate,'' as used in the third sentence of NPRM paragraph (b), which
states that ``the SHA shall advise any other cooperators in the State of the projects included in the final program
and shall incorporate the approved program into the STIP,'' seems vague. It appears to imply that the approved FH program
is independent of the regional and statewide STIP planning requirements of the ISTEA. The commenter felt that, although
this may be the correct way to handle a program of this nature, the process required to ``incorporate'' the final program
into the STIP should be clarified.

One commenter felt that the 41 statewide FH agreements currently in effect between the FHWA and the States (including
Puerto Rico) should be updated and made into tri-party agreements with the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA. This would perpetuate
the ``partnership'' spirit of the ISTEA and facilitate cooperation among the three agencies. It would also eliminate
separate agreements between the FS and the SHA and between the FHWA and the SHA in each State. The wording of this section
should be revised by inserting the words ``the Forest Service'' where necessary, such as after the word ``FHWA'' in
paragraph (a), to include the FS as a signatory agency to the agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because there are some overall FH procedures that not only involve the SHAs, but the FS as well, tri-party agreements
among the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA will be a requirement in the final rule. Because the FHWA and the FS already have separate
two-party FH program agreements for all 40 States, plus Puerto Rico, and because the FHWA does not want to delay the
FH program until all new tri-party agreements are executed, the first sentence of this section of the NPRM was revised
to delete the phrase ``prior to the expenditure of any funds by the FHWA in the State.''

One commenter suggested that, in the first sentence of paragraph (a), the phrase ``or a public authority'' should
be added after the words ``Projects will be administered by the FHWA.'' This would acknowledge that the FS may, in some
cases, administer the design and construction of FH projects. The same commenter also suggested adding the phrase
``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' to the end of the sentence to allow for items included in
statewide agreements to supplement Federal-aid procedures, where appropriate.

Because the FS wants to be able to administer FH projects, this sentence was reworded to add the words ``or the FS'' instead
of ``or a public authority.'' Also, the phrase ``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' was added
to the end of the sentence. This will allow the parties to determine the procedures to be followed in a State.

One commenter suggested that the words ``a public authority'' be substituted for ``cooperator'' in paragraph (b)
of this section. This would allow the FS to perform construction, if appropriate. Cooperators would still be included
since they are, by definition, a public authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because other public authorities that might potentially be involved in a project would also be cooperators, the word
``cooperator'' was kept in the sentence in paragraph (b). However, by adding the words ``the FS'' after FHWA, the FS
will be explicitly allowed to perform construction, if appropriate. Also, paragraph (c), which deals with final
acceptance of the project, was revised to clarify the intent. The word ``construction'' was retained in the language
to differentiate acceptance of the construction work (for the purpose of releasing the contractor) from that of acceptance
of the entire project, including any extra work required to resolve noncontractor-related matters.

In dealing with the same issue discussed in the previous section, as to what constitutes final acceptance of a project,
it was suggested by one commenter that the word ``construction'' be deleted to avoid confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``construction'' is not incorrect in the context of this paragraph, because it describes the type of acceptance
being made. However, the entire sentence was reworded to clarify and minimize possible confusion. By referencing
&sect;660.113(c), which includes the word ``construction,'' the meaning of the term ``construction acceptance''
was retained.

One commenter suggested deleting the phrase ``and the SHAs'' from paragraph (e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the term ``cooperators'' includes SHAs, the phrase was considered redundant and, therefore, deleted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested adding the word ``Generally'' at the beginning of the sentence in paragraph (f) to allow for
those special cases where cash is not obtained in advance of construction procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adding the word ``generally'' to the sentence makes the requirement too much less restrictive. Instead, the following
phrase was added to the end of the last sentence: ``Unless otherwise specified in a project agreement.'' Also, the
word ``shall'' was changed to ``should'' to allow more flexibility.

and Procedures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has determined that this action is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within
the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic
impact of this rulemaking would be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This rule merely
requires the States and Federal agencies to conform to the requirements of the ISTEA. The requirements are basically
incremental to what the States and Federal agencies are required to do under the new ISTEA provisions, such as incorporating
new planning provisions, including metropolitan and statewide transportation plan requirements; and establishing
management systems provisions, including highway safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway
pavements.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation,
the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The revised regulation will not directly affect small businesses because the regulation applies only
to Federal agency, State, and local government transportation programs. However, a minor positive secondary effect
may result from the employment of small businesses, such as engineering consultant firms, to implement some of the
planning and management systems required by the ISTEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Forest Highway (FH) Program which enhances local, regional, and national
benefits of FHs funded under the public lands highway category of the coordinated Federal Lands Highway Program.
As provided in 23 U.S.C. 202, 203, and 204, the program, developed in cooperation with State and local agencies, provides
safe and adequate transportation access to and through National Forest System (NFS) lands for visitors, recreationists,
resource users, and others which is not met by other transportation programs. Forest highways assist rural and community
economic development and promote tourism and travel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1 of each fiscal year, the FHWA will allocate 66 percent of Public Lands Highway funds, by FS Region, for FHs
using values based on relative transportation needs of the NFS, after deducting such sums as deemed necessary for
the administrative requirements of the FHWA and the FS; the necessary costs of FH planning studies; and the FH share
of costs for approved Federal Lands Coordinated Technology Implementation Program studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62560), EPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The NPR proposed two actions:
(a) A limited approval/limited disapproval of the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation, Chapter 129.82
submitted on March 4, 1992; and (b) approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by section 6.7(b), (c), and (h) and section
17(2) of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act as amended on June 29, I992. EPA proposed the approval of Chapter
129.82 as supplemented by sections of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act in the event that Pennsylvania submitted
those sections of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act as a formal SIP revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since Pennsylvania has not submitted the applicable sections from its Air Pollution Control Act as amended on June
29, 1992, EPA is withdrawing its proposed approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by section 6.7(b), (c), and (h)
and section 17(2) of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act, as amended on June 29, 1992. Therefore, this notice
is a final rulemaking action of the March 4, 1992 submittal alone. Other specific requirements of Pennsylvania's
Stage II regulation and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here.
Only one comment pertaining to the NPR was received. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DER)
requested that EPA withhold final action on the Stage II vapor recovery regulation submitted on March 4, I992 until
EPA resolves the issues concerning applicability of Stage II in moderate ozone nonattainment areas. EPA has no issues
to resolve concerning Stage II in moderate ozone nonattainment areas. The onboard vapor recovery requirements required
to be issued prior to January 22, 1994 do not affect requirements in the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter
129.82. States are free to continue to enforce Stage II regulations in moderate ozone nonattainment areas, even after
the promulgation of onboard vapor recovery requirements by EPA. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its limited approval/limited
disapproval of the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82, and the associated definition of gasoline
dispensing facilities located in Chapter 121.1, which is applicable in moderate, serious and severe ozone nonattainment
areas in the Commonwealth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the definition of gasoline dispensing facility in Chapter 121 and the Stage II vapor recovery requirements
in Chapter 129.82 as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP. EPA is also disapproving the Stage II vapor recovery requirements
in Chapter 129.82 for the limited purpose of allowing Pennsylvania the opportunity to correct the testing and certification
requirement deficiencies previously identified by EPA. This final limited disapproval begins the 18 month sanctions
clock for the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the previously identified deficiencies, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 110(k)(3)
and part D. Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements
of the CAA, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted rule(s) under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority
pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval
is limited because EPA's action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does
not meet the section 182(b)(3) requirement of part D because of the noted deficiencies. Thus, EPA is approving the
Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation, Chapter 129.82 submitted under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of
the CAA for the limited purpose of strengthening the Pennsylvania SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also disapproving the Pennsylvania Stage II rule because it contains deficiencies that have not been corrected
and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2),
if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based
on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one
of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval.
Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: highway funding and offsets. The 18 month
period referred to in section 179(a) begins at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover,
the final disapproval triggers the Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). The 18 month
sanctions clock for the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation begins on June 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval.
Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval
of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements
and impose any new Federal requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866,
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action, pertaining to the Pennsylvania
Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82, must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit
by August 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the
finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial
review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged
later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

 NMFS implements provisions of the International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA) that make it unlawful, after June
1, 1994, for any person, to sell, purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship, in the United States, any tuna or tuna
product that is not dolphin safe. The intent of this action is to ensure that the U.S. market does not act as an incentive
to the harvest of tuna caught in association with dolphins or with driftnets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS is required to monitor the importation of certain fish and fish products to ensure compliance with various provisions
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended by the IDCA and the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information
Act (DPCIA). The IDCA states, among other things, that ``It is the policy of the United States.. to ensure that the market
of the United States does not act as an incentive to the harvest of tuna caught in association with dolphins or with driftnets.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IDCA makes it unlawful, after June 1, 1994, for any person to sell, purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship,
in the United States, any tuna or tuna product that is not dolphin safe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna, or a tuna product, is not dolphin safe if it contains tuna that was harvested on the high seas by a vessel engaged
in fishing with driftnets 2.5 km or longer in length (``large-scale driftnets''). As of May&blank;31, 1994, the Secretary
had not identified any nation whose vessels are engaging in fishing with large-scale driftnets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna or a product containing tuna that was harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) by a vessel 400 short
tons (362.8 metric tons (mt)) carrying capacity or greater, is dolphin safe only if it is accompanied by two written
statements: one executed by the captain of the vessel that harvested the tuna, certifying that purse seine nets were
not intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins at any time during the fishing trip (captain's statement);
and the other from a NMFS or Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission official certifying that there was an approved
observer on board the vessel during the entire trip and that purse seine nets were not intentionally deployed during
the trip on, or to encircle, dolphins (observer's statement). Both the captain's and the observer's statements must
be endorsed in writing by each exporter, importer, and processor of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna or a product containing tuna harvested outside the ETP by a purse seine vessel, is dolphin safe if it is accompanied
by a captain's statement, certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on, or to encircle, dolphins
during the particular voyage on which the tuna was harvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna or a product containing tuna harvested outside the ETP by a purse seine vessel in a fishery in which the Secretary
has determined that a regular and significant association occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which tuna
is harvested through the use of purse seine nets deployed on, or to encircle, marine mammals, is dolphin safe if it is
accompanied by a captain's statement and an observer's statement. As of May&blank;31, 1994, the Secretary had not
made such a determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS anticipates that the dolphin-safe documentation requirements of the IDCA and this final rule will primarily
affect tuna harvested with purse seine nets outside of the ETP. In accordance with the importation requirements of
50 CFR 216.24(e), all tuna, other than fresh, is required to be accompanied by a NOAA Form 370 ``Fisheries Certificate
of Origin'' (FCO) upon importation into the United States. NMFS believes that most tuna marketed in the United States
(U.S.-harvested, as well as imports) is labeled ``dolphin safe'' in accordance with DPCIA labeling standards. Therefore,
most tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying capacity or greater and sold
in the United States meets the dolphin-safe documentation requirements (i.e., it is accompanied by an FCO, as well
as captain's and observer's statements and endorsements). For imported tuna harvested outside the ETP by a purse
seine vessel, this regulation requires that a captain's statement be attached to the FCO. In addition, for tuna harvested
outside the ETP by a U.S. purse seine vessel, this regulation requires a captain's statement. The FCO's must be endorsed
by each exporter, importer, and processor of the tuna, as described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Customs Service (USCS) controls the importation of tuna and tuna products into the United States. USCS will
verify that a captain's statement accompanies shipments of tuna and tuna product containing tuna harvested by purse
seine outside the ETP, and that a captain's statement and an observer's statement, endorsed in writing by every exporter,
importer, and processor, accompany tuna or tuna product containing tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is codified in 50 CFR 216.24(e)(9). The former text of paragraph 216.24(e)(9) that is replaced by this regulation
was effective only through 1986. Therefore, deletion of that language has no regulatory effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule codifies statutory requirements and prohibitions that became effective pursuant to the IDCA after June
1, 1994. Therefore, under authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists to waive the notice and comment
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act as such procedures are unnecessary. Further, in that this rule
incorporates a statutory requirement already in effect, good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day
delay in effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collections
found at 50 CFR 216.24(e) have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Control
Number 0648&hyph;0040 for tuna or a tuna product that contains tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of 400
short tons (362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity or greater and that is labeled ''dolphin safe.'' The public reporting
burden for this collection was previously estimated to be 0.66 hours per response, including the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information (56 FR 47418, September 19, 1991). The IDCA now mandates that the same reporting requirement
apply to all tuna or tuna products containing tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP by these vessels, and it is expected
that the same reporting burden will apply. In addition, all tuna or tuna products containing tuna harvested by purse
seine vessel outside the ETP must now be accompanied by the captain's statement described above. The reporting burden
for the completion of the captain's statement for tuna harvested by purse seine outside of the ETP is estimated to be
0.083 hours per response. Also, tuna harvested outside the ETP must now be accompanied by an FCO and captain's statement.
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or on any other aspect of this collection of information, including
suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (see ADDRESSES) and to the Office of
Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 0648&hyph;0400, Washington, D.C. 20503 (Attn: NOAA Desk Officer).

 The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut
Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol
Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this inseason action pursuant to
IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State
of the United States of America (58 FR 17791, April 6, 1993). On behalf of the IPHC, this inseason action is published

North Washington Coast Sport Fishery to Close
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The north Washington coast (waters west of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line and south to the Queets River) sport halibut harvest
through May 22 is 47,699 lb (21.6 mt). It is anticipated that the catch limit of 68,039 lb (30.9 mt) for this area will
be reached on May 28. Therefore, the sport halibut fishery in this area will close at 11:59 p.m. on May 28, and remain
closed for the remainder of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anglers have landed an estimated 6,500 lb (3.0 mt) of Pacific halibut in Neah Bay, WA, that were caught in Canadian waters.
Fishing remains open in Canadian waters with a two fish daily bag limit, no size restriction. Anglers desiring to fish
in Canadian waters are strongly urged to contact Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans at (604) 666-0383/0583
for sport fishing information concerning licensing and the nautical description of closed areas.

 NMFS is prohibiting retention of Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands
management area (BSAI). NMFS is requiring that catches of Greenland turbot in the BS be treated in the same manner as
prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the Greenland turbot
total allowable catch (TAC) in the BS has been reached.

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the BS was established by the final 1994
initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59
FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 4,667 metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS has determined in accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(9), that the Greenland turbot
TAC in the BS has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of Greenland turbot in the BS be treated
as prohibited species in accordance with &sect;675.20(c)(3), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 8, 1994, until
12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) restricts the operation of longer combination
vehicles (LCV's) on the Interstate Highway System and commercial motor vehicle (CMV) combinations with two or more
cargo-carrying units on the National Network (NN) to the types of vehicles in use on or before June 1, 1991, subject
to whatever State restrictions were in effect on that date. The ISTEA also includes special variances from the June
1 date for Alaska, Ohio, and Wyoming. As required by the ISTEA and based on information provided by the States, industry,
and the public, the final rule lists applicable limitations by specific vehicle combination, by State, in effect
on June 1, 1991, and does not further restrict the operation of any vehicle in lawful operation on or before June 1, 1991.
This rule also establishes criteria for States to make minor adjustments to the list of limitations; defines certain
terms, such as ``nondivisible load,'' ``beverage container,'' and ``maxi-cube'' vehicle; makes technical amendments
to the list of federally-designated routes on the NN; and makes other minor changes to conform existing regulations
to the ISTEA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1023 of the ISTEA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1951, codified at 23 U.S.C. 127(d)) required States,
within 60 days of the date of enactment, to submit to the Secretary of Transportation for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 30 days thereafter a complete list of (1) all operations of LCV's being conducted as of June 1, 1991; (2) State laws,
regulations, and any other limitations and conditions, including routing-specific and configuration-specific
designations governing the operation of LCV's; and (3) a copy of such laws, regulations, limitations, and conditions.
An LCV is defined in the ISTEA as any combination of a truck tractor and two or more trailers or semitrailers which operates
on the Interstate System at a gross vehicle weight greater than 80,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, section 4006 of the ISTEA (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j)) required the States to submit a complete list of State
length limitations applicable to CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units in effect on or before June
1, 1991. This section prohibits States from allowing the operation (by statute, regulation, permit, or other means)
of CMV's with cargo-carrying unit lengths that exceed the length, by specific configuration, allowed and in actual,
lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) on the NN in that State
on or before June 1, 1991. The NN is defined in 23 CFR 658.5, and includes the Interstate System, with minor exceptions,
and selected non-Interstate routes. The non-Interstate NN highways are listed in appendix A to part 658. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1023 and 4006 provide that no statute or regulation shall be included on the list submitted by a State or published
by the Secretary merely on the grounds that it authorized, or could have authorized, by permit or otherwise, the operation
of LCV or CMV combinations not in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis on or before June 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may continue to issue special permits, in accordance with applicable State laws, for those vehicles and loads
which cannot be easily dismantled or divided. A definition of such nondivisible loads is included in this final rule.

The ISTEA included three narrow exceptions to the June 1, 1991, freeze date. Wyoming would have been able to allow the
operation of additional vehicle configurations not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, provided they were authorized
by State law not later than November 3, 1992. No additional vehicles were authorized, however, and accordingly no
additional vehicles are included in appendix C over those listed in the previous two rulemakings on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio may allow LCV's with three cargo-carrying units of 28.5 feet each (not including the truck tractor) not in actual
operation on June 1, 1991, to be operated within its boundaries on the 1-mile segment of Ohio State Route 7 which begins
at, and extends south of, Exit 16 on the Ohio Turnpike. Alaska may continue to allow the operation of CMV's which were
not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but which were in actual operation prior to July 6, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A preliminary list of the information provided by the States in response to sections 1023 and 4006 was published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on March 20, 1992 (57 FR 9900). A second proposed list of vehicles and restrictions,
including corrections, clarifications, and additional material submitted to the docket in response to the NPRM
was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) on February 25, 1993 (58 FR 11450). In the NPRM
the information provided by the States was organized into appendices C and D to part 658; in the SNPRM that information
was combined into a single list of vehicles and restrictions and presented as a new appendix C. The format of the SNPRM
has been retained for the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to publication of the SNPRM, 154 sets of comments were received from 136 separate entities. The vast majority
of those comments deal with specifics on the information published in the SNPRM, and they will be discussed under individual
topical headings. Four of the commenters, however, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), the Wyoming
Trucking Association, Inc. (WTA), the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, and the Citizens
for Reliable And Safe Highways (CRASH), provided comments concerning the rulemaking in general, and the philosophy
used by the FHWA in presenting the information. These particular comments provide an opportunity for the FHWA to explain
its approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA stipulates that the ``final list'' of LCV operational requirements for each State be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not later than 180 days after the date of enactment. That date was June 15, 1992. The lead comment by the CRASH in its docket
submission was that publication of the final list by the FHWA was ``long overdue.'' The CRASH contends that since the
freeze does not take effect until the Secretary publishes the final list, the FHWA's delay in publication has prevented
the law from taking effect. This in turn means that LCV's may today be operating on highways from which Congress intended
they be barred. It concludes this comment by stating that the review and correction process included with the final
rule can be used to make corrections after publication of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the FHWA stated in the Supplementary Information section of the SNPRM, the content of the States' original responses
to the ISTEA request for LCV operational information covered the full range of what could be supplied, both in terms
of items covered and volume of material. The diversity of the contents of the responses was so great that the FHWA determined
that before any list could be finalized, increased uniformity both in terms of items covered and the type of information
would be necessary. Thus, despite the likelihood that the statutory due date for a final rule might be missed, the FHWA
determined that it was in the public's interest to publish a SNPRM soliciting further public comment on revisions
to the initial list. The FHWA considered publishing a ``final list'' without this additional public procedure, but
believed that the list published at that stage would have required numerous subsequent changes. We believe that the
intent of Congress in including a correction process was to take care of relatively minor single-issue situations
which may be discovered after publication of this final rule, not to make wholesale changes in a State's submission
without good cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA expressed concern that the interpretations used by the FHWA in developing this rule have involved many combination
vehicles that, until passage of the ISTEA, were not considered by anyone to be LCV's. In a similar vein, Alaska commented
that the SNPRM ``seeks to significantly expand the ISTEA legislation and, we believe, severely constrains the states'
abilities to legitimately regulate commercial traffic within each state.''

This final rule implements two similar, yet separate provisions of the ISTEA. Section 1023, as discussed earlier,
involves LCV's and includes an LCV definition. The scope of vehicle combinations covered by this section is narrow.
The definition requires that an LCV combination include a truck tractor, which by previous congressional action
(section 411(f), Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982) is defined as a noncargo-carrying power
unit and two or more trailers or semitrailers. The combination must operate on the Interstate System, and its gross
vehicle weight must be in excess of 80,000 pounds. The vehicles listed in appendix C as a result of this statutory definition
include only what might best be described as the ``traditional'' LCV's, that is, the ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike''
Doubles and the ``Triple.'' Under the definition of LCV provided by the ISTEA, it is true that the State of Alaska has
no LCV's because it has no Interstate System mileage in the sense used in the ISTEA; that is, Alaska does not have Interstate
System mileage designated under 23 U.S.C. 103(e), 139(a), or 139(b). Accordingly, all references to LCV's for Alaska
have been deleted from this final rule.

Alaska does, however, have mileage that is part of the NN. Section 4006 of the ISTEA requires the FHWA to include in the
final list ``any commercial motor vehicle combination *&blank;*&blank;* with 2 or more cargo carrying units.''
A ``cargo-carrying unit'' is defined as ``any portion of a commercial motor vehicle combination *&blank;*&blank;*
used for carrying cargo, including a trailer, semitrailer, or the cargo carrying section of a single unit truck.''
While section 1023 is relatively narrow in scope, section 4006 has very widespread applicability. If, as the WTA contends,
vehicles not previously considered to be LCV's are covered by this final rule, it is because of section 4006. This section
is also the reason that vehicles are listed in appendix C for Alaska. Thus, vehicles not previously considered LCV's
are included in this final rule, because the statute applies to more than just LCV's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA expressed concern that the FHWA's attempt to organize the vehicles subject to the freeze into four basic categories
requires the FHWA to go beyond the role established for it in the ISTEA. The ATA contends that the ISTEA limits the role
of the Secretary to reviewing for accuracy and publishing State information and that the categorization made by the
FHWA involves the interpretation of State laws and regulations. Similarly, Alaska commented that the nomenclature
used in designating the four basic categories ``is not universally acceptable.'' The categories used in appendix
C, as included in the SNPRM, were (1) Rocky Mountain Doubles, (2) Turnpike Doubles, (3) Triples, and (4) Other. These
names were chosen in an attempt to describe the vehicles covered by the freeze in terms commonly used in the trucking
industry. Since there is no industry-wide or statutory definition for categories 1, 2, or 3, a degree of confusion
remained as to just what vehicle combinations were covered, especially by categories 1 and 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA required the FHWA to list vehicles by ``configuration type'' (section 1023) or ``specific configuration''
(section 4006). In creating the basic configuration categories used in the NPRM and SNPRM, the FHWA believed it had
to go beyond just publishing State-submitted information. For example, many States do not differentiate between
a ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Double in the statutes or regulations which authorize their operation. Typically,
these States allow a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer, or a truck tractor and two trailing units where each trailing
unit can be up to some maximum length. Interpretations were required to develop the maximum parameters that would
apply if the State did differentiate by vehicle type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has re-examined the meaning of ``configuration,'' however, and determined that there is no statutory requirement
to classify vehicle combinations according to industry usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to reduce confusion and simplify the description of vehicles covered by the freeze, the vehicles described
in appendix C of this final rule have therefore been regrouped into three categories: (1) Truck tractor and two trailing
units, (2) Truck tractor and three trailing units, and (3) Other. This preserves the freeze required by the ISTEA without
limiting the discretion allowed by some States before June 1, 1991.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing the March 20, 1992, NPRM and the February 25, 1993, SNPRM, the FHWA decided not to include certain vehicle
combinations submitted by the States, which it determined Congress did not intend to include in the ISTEA freeze.
No additional information regarding conditions, routes, or authority to operate these vehicles was required. In
addition to describing the categories of vehicles proposed for exemption, a detailed listing by State of the vehicles
submitted but exempted was contained in the SNPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments, the ATA urged the FHWA to include in the regulatory language of the final rule the list of exempted vehicles
included in the preamble to the SNPRM. The basis for the ATA's suggestion was ``to ensure that only the vehicles intended
by Congress are restricted and to help clarify the intent of the restriction for enforcement and judicial purposes.''
The ATA's proposal was to include the list of excepted vehicles in an expanded definition of LCV in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The categories of multiple cargo unit vehicles exempted from coverage by the freeze include: (1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer
and truck tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations with a maximum length of the individual cargo units of
28.5 feet or less, (2) conventional automobile and boat transporters with an overall length of 65 feet or less, (3)
stinger-steered automobile and boat transporters with an overall length of 75 feet or less, (4) truck-trailer and
truck-semitrailer combinations with an overall length of 65 feet or less, (5) maxi-cubes, (6) most tow trucks with
vehicles in tow, and (7) combination vehicles which include a truck tractor containing a dromedary box, deck, or plate,
and one semitrailer or trailer. With respect to the dromedary equipped vehicle exclusion, strict interpretation
of ISTEA section 4006 would include this equipment under the freeze. By its function, a dromedary box, deck, or plate
is a cargo-carrying unit. When combined with a semitrailer, the result is technically a combination with two cargo-carrying
units, thus subjecting the combination to the freeze. However, dromedary equipped truck tractors in actual operation
on December 1, 1982, are grandfathered under &sect;658.13(f), causing a combination consisting of one of these units
and a semitrailer to be considered as simply a truck tractor-semitrailer under the provisions of part 658. Dromedary
equipped semitrailer combinations are a minor segment of the industry which probably escaped the notice of Congress,
and which would require a good deal of additional time and effort to list. Should States or carriers try to evade the
ISTEA freeze mandate by expanding the size of these unlisted combinations, the FHWA may have to initiate rulemaking
to close this loophole.

The exclusion information is codified by this final rule at &sect;658.23(b)(1) through (b)(5). The list of exempted
vehicles by State included in the SNPRM has not been codified, however, because of the likelihood that it is not a complete
list. The original instruction to the States about these vehicles was to submit anything they thought might be covered
by the freeze. Since the effect of ATA's comment would be to exempt only those vehicle combinations listed, some States
could be penalized in terms of allowing certain vehicles simply because they reviewed the guidelines and made a decision
that certain vehicles were not involved in the freeze coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of LCV used throughout this proceeding is that established in the ISTEA. In the interest of avoiding

Under the terms of ISTEA section 1023, an LCV may continue to operate only if on or before June 1, 1991, the specific configuration
was (1) legally allowed in the State and (2) was in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis. Under section
4006, the overall length of two or more cargo-carrying units used in a specific configuration may not exceed the length
allowed by State law, and in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis, on or before June 1, 1991. If a specific
multi-trailer configuration was authorized by State statute or regulation, but

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the vehicles listed in appendix C meet the requirements for continued operation set forth in ISTEA sections
1023 and 4006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information on these vehicles which the States supplied in response to the ISTEA, the March 20, 1992, NPRM and the
February 25, 1993, SNPRM, satisfies the legal requirement for operation, i.e., authorized by State law. In a similar
manner, various commenters, responding to a request contained in the SNPRM, have documented the actual operation
on a regular or periodic basis of the vehicle combinations listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNPRM requested information, from any source, to show the actual operation of vehicles described in appendix
C. While a copy of the special permit under which operations occurred was listed as the preferred means of satisfying
the documentation requirement, any item which could support operation of these vehicles would be considered as acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an early response to the docket, the ATA expressed concern that the FHWA was placing a ``tremendous burden on State
DOT's and the trucking industry to satisfy a totally new requirement in a very short time period.'' The SNPRM allowed
for a 45-day comment period with April 12, 1993, as the docket closing date. The ATA also stated that ``(i)t is unlikely
that two year old copies of the actual permit will be available,'' and that working with the permit issuing offices
in each State to locate these records would ``no doubt be a very time consuming and cumbersome process.'' As an alternative,
the ATA suggested that the FHWA allow the submission of an affidavit from a carrier and/or State agency to satisfy the
documentation requirement, and further that a time extension be granted to allow appropriate review and certification
of these documents, if allowed. A request for a time extension for the docket was also received from the WTA and Coastal
Chem Sales Company of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The need to accurately comply with the actual operation documentation requirement
was given as the reason for the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments, the CRASH stated that the proof requirement contained in the SNPRM was ``far too broad, and (could)
easily lead to mistake or fraud.'' That organization argued that anything less than ``verifiable documentary evidence
created and dated on or before June 1, 1991, specifically detailing the vehicle length, weight, configuration and
routes traveled'' would fail to comply with ISTEA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the time extension requests, the FHWA agreed that more time was needed to help assure that accurate and
complete documentation information, including affidavits, was submitted to the docket. On April 14, 1993, a 45-day
extension of the comment period, to May 27, 1993, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 19367. The type of information the CRASH argued the FHWA should require appears to exceed the documentation
most States demand of LCV operators. It would distort the purpose of the ISTEA freeze to ban certain vehicles or routes
simply because the States lacked the foresight to issue permits that met the maximum possible data requirements of
a Federal law not yet enacted.

An affidavit made by an individual familiar with the issue at hand is both reasonable and within the documentation
parameters established by the SNPRM. The authenticity of any document proposed as evidence to support activity occurring
over 21/2 years ago could be challenged by any party. Of the possible items of documentation which could be submitted,
a notarized affidavit may be the least susceptible to alteration. It represents an individual's witnessed, sworn
statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An affidavit could, of course, be fraudulent, and the FHWA would be reluctant to take regulatory action based solely
on an affidavit without other support. In fact, however, affidavits are merely one kind of information which the FHWA
has combined with other types of documentation to demonstrate the operation of vehicles that State law and/or regulation
allows. In addition, section 1023(c) of the ISTEA amended 23 U.S.C. 141(b) by adding at the end the following sentence:
``Each State shall also certify that it is enforcing and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
complying with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the provisions of section 127(d) of this title and section 411(j) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of
1982 (49 U.S.C. App. 2311(j))'' (emphasis added). Additional discussion of the certification change is contained
elsewhere in this document. However, for this discussion the statement means that if a State is found not to be complying
with the ISTEA LCV requirements, it will be subject to Federal-aid highway funding sanctions involving millions
of dollars annually.

Two permits were issued by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for ``Triples'' at the request
of the California legislature in 1971 in order to conduct a test to evaluate the possible allowance of ``Triples''
in California. In 1983, permits were issued to allow the operation of the above described vehicle combinations in
order to conduct an over the road test of these vehicles. The State, in its comments, points out that the 1983 tests were
conducted, in part, to assist the FHWA in its study of the costs and benefits of a national intercity LCV route network.

Based on these two occurrences, California claims the right to issue permits for good cause for the future operation
of these vehicles up to the limits stated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has rejected California's claim because it fails to meet the standard for ``regular or periodic'' use established
by Congress in writing the ISTEA. According to the Conference Report on the ISTEA (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong.,
1st Sess. 314 (1991)), ``Use of an LCV on only one or two occasions pursuant to a special permit would not provide a basis
for satisfactorily certifying grandfather rights or operations under this subsection.'' Clearly the California
situation falls within the scope of the congressional guidance. ``Triples'' were allowed twice, for very brief periods
12 years apart, the last being more than 10 years ago. ``Turnpike Doubles'' and ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' were authorized
only once, over 10 years ago, during a single 5-day period. These occurrences do not constitute ``regular or periodic''
use.

No documentation was received in the docket to support the actual operation of this vehicle on or before June 1, 1991.
This vehicle was originally included because it appeared to meet the LCV or extra-length multi-unit commercial vehicle
requirements. This vehicle is made up of a truck tractor and a dolly unit. Since the weight of a cargo, for example utility
poles, is carried partially by the truck tractor and partially by the dolly unit, the argument might be made that this
vehicle has two cargo-carrying units.

4 feet for interunit spacing to the twin 29-foot dimension. Due to the de-listing of a vehicle combination with twin

No documentation was received in the docket to support the actual operation of this vehicle on or before June 1, 1991.
The initial submission by New Hampshire, to satisfy the LCV freeze requirements, indicated the listed combination
was allowed because State law does not prohibit a straight truck of up to 40 feet long from pulling a trailer that may
be up to 48 feet long. Due to the de-listing of the described vehicle combination, the maximum cargo-carrying length
of any truck-trailer combination on NN highways reverts to 58 feet. This length is derived by subtracting 7 feet for
the cab from the 65-foot overall length for this combination allowed by this rule without a requirement to document
actual operations. Off the NN, the maximum lengths allowed by State law continue to apply.

List of ISTEA Vehicle Operations and Conditions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the lists of vehicle configurations, the ISTEA also required each State to submit a copy of all its statutes,
regulations, limitations, and conditions which apply to the operation of each of the LCV's or extra-length vehicles
reported as in use on or before June 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The content of the States' original responses to this request covered the full range of what could be supplied, both
in terms of items covered and volume of material. The diversity of the contents of the responses was so great that the
FHWA determined that before any list could be finalized, increased uniformity would be necessary. One of the subheadings
for each LCV or extra-length vehicle described in the NPRM was ``Operational Conditions.'' The information in the
NPRM was taken directly from the initial State responses to the LCV information request contained in the ISTEA, regardless
of content. In those cases where another document was referenced, the FHWA attempted to summarize that document.
Because of the differences in State-provided responses, there was little consistency as to coverage or depth. Therefore,
in addition to asking for comments, the NPRM also asked the States and all other sources, including industry trade

The State DOT commented that the weight restriction discussion in the SNPRM for Alaska should not apply because the
section 1023 freeze applies only to the Interstate System, and Alaska does not have Interstate System mileage designated
under 23 U.S.C. 103, 139(a), or 139(b). The FHWA agrees with this comment. Accordingly, the weight condition for each
vehicle described has been revised to indicate that a carrier has to be in compliance with State laws and regulations
and does not list maximum weight limit values. In addition, because LCV's, as defined in the ISTEA, do not operate in
Alaska due to the lack of Interstate System mileage, the ``LCV'' notation previously included by the combination
description has been removed.

The CRASH stated that Alaska Administrative Permit Manual Section 11.6 provides that ``all oversize or overweight
vehicles not in convoy shall maintain a minimum distance of 800 to 1,500 feet from any other oversize vehicle or vehicle
with load and pilot car traveling in the same direction on the same highway in rural areas.'' Since Alaska is not contiguous
to any other State this type of information would be of little use to any out-of-State trucker. Any vehicle requiring
a permit would be subject to the Alaska permit rules which would be given to the driver when the permit was obtained.
Therefore, in view of its limited usefulness in terms of general information, we will not add this provision to appendix
C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4006(a) of the ISTEA provides that Alaska ``may allow operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations
which were not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but which were in actual operation prior to July 6, 1991.'' Verification
has been furnished that ``Triples'' with trailers not over 45 feet in length were in actual operation under permit
prior to July 6, 1991. The CRASH believes that the operation of ``Triples'' after June 1, 1991, was authorized only
on an experimental basis as provided in 17 AAC 25.106(b)(4). However, the ISTEA allows the continued operation of
any combinations put into service between June 2 and July 5, 1991, without further condition. Therefore, ``Triples''
may continue to operate, as indicated in appendix C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State advised that under Alaska regulations, a truck tractor equipped with a dromedary box is defined as not being
cargo carrying. Dromedary boxes do in fact carry cargo. However, for the reasons given above, the FHWA has decided
for the time being not to list the cargo-carrying length of dromedary tractor-semitrailer combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State indicated that an additional route, AK&hyph;1 from Palmer-Wasilla Highway Junction to Wishbone Hill Coal
Access Road, must be added to Alaska's routes chart under the caption for ``Rocky Mountain Double-LCV'' (58 FR 11467)
of the SNPRM. However, this is incorrect because the freeze on vehicle length is applicable only on the NN, and this
is not an NN route. The State is free to regulate the size and weight of vehicles off the NN as it sees fit.

The CRASH stated that Arizona statute ARS 28&hyph;1011.N should not be shown as authority for permitting overweight
vehicles on the NN since it only covers the issuance of permits on other than NN routes. We agree, since the provisions
of Section 4006 of the ISTEA apply only to vehicles on the NN. Therefore, ARS 28&hyph;1011.N has been deleted from the
``Legal Citations'' for Arizona in appendix C.

The CRASH stated that the legal size for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' is 90 feet, and not 92 feet as shown in proposed appendix
C contained in the SNPRM. Arizona statute ARS 28&hyph;1011.A provides that the Arizona DOT may issue oversize permits
for vehicles exceeding otherwise applicable length limits on the State highway system. Further, the change in categories
from those listed in the SNPRM makes this a moot point insofar as the final appendix C is concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH stated that the State may not issue ``verbal policy directives'' authorizing overlength vehicles. It adds
that the State appears to be violating its own statutes. The question cannot be resolved in this proceeding but the
FHWA will investigate the issue in connection with Arizona's certification of compliance with 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH also stated that weight limits for LCV's on US 89A and I&hyph;15 cannot be determined under ARS 28&hyph;1011.N.
The FHWA agrees. Since the ISTEA freezes the weight of LCV's only on the Interstate System, we will not further consider
weight limits on US 89A. The State indicated that the maximum allowable weight limits for all LCV's on the Interstate
System is 111,000 pounds, except for ``Triples,'' which it said are subject to a maximum allowable weight of 123,500
pounds. The 111,000-pound maximum weight limits are specifically authorized under ARS 28&hyph;1011.M, and higher
maximum weights may be authorized under ARS 28&hyph;1011.A on the State highway system. Since the State indicated
that the highest weight authorized for ``Triples'' on or before June 1, 1991, was 123,500 pounds, that value is retained
in appendix C.

Appendix C in the SNPRM showed the cargo-carrying length for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' in Colorado as 85 feet, for
``Turnpike Doubles'' 95 feet, for ``Triples'' 95 feet, and for truck-trailer combinations as 78 feet. However, on
June 1, 1991, the State actually allowed one of the trailing units in ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' to be up to 48 feet long
and the other up to 28 feet 6 inches long, with not over 15 feet of hitch between the two units, or a total cargo-carrying
length of 91.5 feet. The State also allowed ``Turnpike Doubles'' to have two trailers of approximately equal length,
not to exceed 48 feet each, with a hitch not to exceed 15 feet in length. The resulting cargo-carrying length becomes
111 feet. Revised appendix C has been changed to reflect these values.

42&hyph;4&hyph;409(11)(a)(II)(A), (B), or (C), and comply with Rule 4&hyph;15 in the rules pertaining to Extra-Legal
Vehicles or Loads.'' The State also commented that the time restrictions on the operation of ``Rocky Mountain Doubles''
in the next sentence should be changed from 7 a.m. to 6 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 3 p.m. and that the sentence in parentheses
should read as follows: ``('Rocky Mountain' doubles not operating at greater than the legal maximum weight of 80,000
pounds are subject to different hours of operation restrictions. Refer to rules pertaining to the Operation of Longer
Vehicle Combinations on Designated State Highway Segments).'' The CRASH said motor carriers that operate ISTEA
vehicles must have an established safety program as provided in Chapter 9 of the Colorado Department of Highways Rules
and Regulations for Operation of Longer Vehicle Combinations on Designated State Highway Segments. Elements of
the program include compliance with minimum safety standards at 8 CCR 1507&hyph;1; hazardous materials regulations
at 8 CCR 1507&hyph;7, 8, and 9; Colorado Uniform Motor Vehicle Law, Articles 1 through 4 of Title 42, C.R.S., as amended;
and Public Utility Commission's regulations at 4 CCR 723&hyph;6, 8, 15, 22, and 23. Revised appendix C includes these

Vehicles or Load Rules. However, when the rules address the same subject, the LVC, since it is operating at greater
than 80,000 pounds, must comply with the Extra-Legal Vehicles or Loads Rules. Such rules are: 4&hyph;1&hyph;2 and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State pointed out that no maximum gross weight is shown in connection with the truck-trailer combination listed
in appendix C. This is correct because a truck-trailer combination is not an LCV as defined in the ISTEA since it is not
a combination of a truck tractor and two or more trailers or semitrailers. Therefore, its maximum weight on the Interstates
is not frozen as of June 1, 1991, but remains as provided in 23 U.S.C. 127(a). The listing for this combination has been
changed in appendix C by adding ``WEIGHT'' as a separate category under ``Operational Conditions'' and indicating
that the vehicle must be in compliance with State laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also noted that ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' could operate from milepoint 8.9 to milepoint 9.7 on State Highway
133 in Delta. However, as this is not on the Interstate System or the NN, the ISTEA freeze provisions do not apply. Accordingly,
the route is not listed in the vehicle descriptions. The CRASH said that prior to June 1, 1991, ``Rocky Mountain Doubles''
could operate on I&hyph;70 from the Utah State Line only to State Highway 65 (Exit 49). In fact, the route was extended
from State Highway 65 to State Highway 13 (Exit 90) on April 5, 1990. Since this was prior to June 1, 1991, ``Rocky Mountain
Doubles'' may continue to operate from the Utah State Line to State Highway 13 (Exit 90) after that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also commented that the freeze on the operation of LCV's on the Interstate System and the freeze on the operation
of CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN may create administrative and enforcement problems. However,
it also recognized that this arises from the ISTEA and cannot be changed in this proceeding.

Florida commented that the 106-foot length previously given for ``Turnpike Doubles,'' now shown for a truck tractor
and two trailing unit combination, is incorrect. The maximum length should be 116 feet. The 116-foot dimension is
the maximum overall vehicle length established by State regulation. Appendix C is a listing which includes maximum
cargo-carrying length. The convention used throughout this rulemaking is that, in the absence of any information
to the contrary, cargo-carrying length for a truck tractor combination is the maximum overall length minus 10 feet.
Thus, 106 feet remains the cargo-carrying length value for Florida's truck tractor and two trailing unit combination.

The State also expressed concern over the fact that the vehicles listed for Florida are not considered LCV's as provided
in the ISTEA definition, because the route on which they operate, Florida's Turnpike, is not part of the Interstate
System. The State made the point that the twin-trailer combinations which operate on the Florida Turnpike match the
configuration and weight criteria for LCV's, and only an administrative action, whether or not the Turnpike is part
of the Interstate System, keeps them from being designated as such.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until the ISTEA was enacted, the meaning of the term LCV differed from one region to another, and sometimes depended
on the commodity being transported. By providing a definition of LCV, Congress has provided a basis for describing
these combinations on a national basis. Any combination which does not meet all of the criteria, including operation
on the Interstate System, is not to be considered an LCV.

The CRASH stated that the SNPRM omitted the provisions for time-of-travel restrictions for overlegal loads published
in Idaho Transportation Department Rule 39.C.11.5, and the requirement that an applicant for a permit certify that
the load is indivisible. These restrictions apply only to nondivisible loads as indicated in Rule 39.C.11.4.c. There
are no time-of-day restrictions for Extra-Length Vehicle Combinations operating under permits issued pursuant
to Rule 39.C.22. The CRASH also indicated that time-of-travel restrictions applied to overweight loads under Rule
39.C.11.5. Although the rule is entitled ``Time of Travel Restrictions for Overlegal Loads,'' the text deals only
with ``oversize'' loads. The CRASH said that the SNPRM omitted seasonal weight limits in Rule 39.C.14. The Rule simply
provides that such limits will be posted. Therefore, they are in the same category as speed limits or other general
restrictions that all vehicles must observe.

The ``Dromedary tractor semitrailer'' combination listed in the SNPRM has been removed from appendix C due to the

combination has also been removed from appendix C due to the dromedary equipment exclusion. This vehicle is covered
by the listing for the truck tractor and two trailing unit LCV's.

I&hyph;70 in Western Kansas: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kansas allows SVC's on the short segment of I&hyph;70 from Goodland to the Colorado State line. Kansas submitted this
information and it was published in the NPRM. The FHWA subsequently learned that SVC operations began on that route
only on May 31, 1991, the day before the June 1 freeze date.

The ISTEA provides that LCV's (including SVC's) must have operated ``on a regular or periodic basis'' on or before
June 1, 1991 (23 U.S.C. 127(d)(1)(A)). According to the ISTEA conference report:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To be considered ``regular or periodic'' use, operations must have occurred at recurring intervals over a period
of time. Moreover, periodic operations must have occurred on an intermittent but consistent basis. Use of an LCV on
only one or two occasions pursuant to a special permit would not provide a basis for satisfactorily certifying grandfather
rights or operations *&blank;*&blank;* . (H.R. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., at 314 (1991))

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because SVC operations on I&hyph;70 did not appear to be ``regular or periodic'' by this standard, the FHWA revised
the SNPRM to remove the Goodland segment from the list of authorized Kansas LCV routes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Thirty-seven commenters discussed this subject, and all of them favored restoration of the I&hyph;70 route. Yellow
Corporation, the parent company of Yellow Freight, explained in detail how the problem arose. Yellow Freight uses
a hub and spoke system. The company commented that ``(w)here distances between hubs do not allow for the journey to
be made within the ten-hour federal drivers hours of service limit, Yellow Freight has established driver relay facilities
(where) *&blank;*&blank;* drivers *&blank;*&blank;* are changed, with the equipment moving on to meet customer
service demands.'' Yellow Freight has for 25 years maintained a driver relay facility at Goodland which serves vehicles
moving between its Kansas City and Denver hubs. ``Linehaul drivers leave Kansas City westbound to Goodland, layover
and return eastbound the next day. Goodland-domiciled linehaul drivers operate a turn between Goodland and the Denver
hub.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado authorized triple-trailer and other large combinations in 1989. Unlike competitors with facilities in
eastern Colorado, Yellow Freight was unable to use these vehicles between Goodland and Denver because Kansas did
not allow them on I&hyph;70. Rather than move its relay facility into Colorado or forgo the economic advantages of
``Triples,'' Yellow Freight asked Kansas in September 1989, to allow SVC's on
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
I&hyph;70 between Goodland and the Colorado line. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) announced a rulemaking
proposal in January 1990, that would have allowed ``Triples'' on all Kansas Interstates. The Kansas Railroad Association
(KRA) responded by having a bill to ban ``Triples'' introduced in the legislature; the KDOT withdrew its proposal.
Yellow Freight and the KRA negotiated a compromise which, among other things, allowed triple-trailer combinations
on the Goodland segment of I&hyph;70. The bill was approved on April 12, 1990, and SVC regulations to implement it were
promulgated on March 4, 1991. Yellow Freight ran one ``Triple'' on May 31, 1991, and a second on June 1.

I&hyph;70 operations on the FHWA's failure to clarify its position on the State's grandfather rights in a timely fashion.
The FHWA and a number of States_not including Kansas_had long disagreed on the question of whether LCV operations
were legitimately grandfathered. One of the purposes of the LCV freeze was to resolve these disputes by ratifying
actual operations allowed by State law on June 1, 1991. The KDOT's announced intention to allow SVC's on I&hyph;70
was one more indication of the rapid spread of LCV's in States west of the Mississippi. Because of the desirability
of a uniform policy toward all States that allowed LCV operations, the FHWA did not immediately address the question
of Kansas' grandfather rights. However, on April 8, 1991, just over a month after the KDOT's regulations authorizing
SVC permits became effective, the FHWA asked for an opinion by the Kansas Attorney General (AG). The KDOT requested
the opinion on April 26, 1991, and the AG replied on May 30, 1991, that the State's grandfather rights were broad enough
to encompass SVC operations on I&hyph;70. Since the issue here is ``regular or periodic'' operations, it would serve
no purpose to discuss the AG's grandfather claims. The KDOT quickly issued an annual SVC permit to Yellow Freight and
operations began the following day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's regulatory process was not completed until March 4, 1991, and the Kansas AG required more than a month to
respond to the KDOT's request for an opinion. The FHWA had no part in these delays. It is true, however, that the KDOT
made a good faith effort to satisfy the FHWA's legal concerns and postponed the start of SVC operations on I&hyph;70
until the deadline included in the draft ISTEA legislation had nearly passed. We do not wish to penalize Kansas simply
for cooperating with the FHWA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Yellow Freight asserted that ``(a)s originally drafted, the Federal LCV freeze date would have been April 1, 1991.
Senator Dole's office intervened to move that federal freeze date to June 1, 1991, specifically to accommodate the
Goodland triples route.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA was deeply involved in the Congressional deliberations leading to the LCV freeze. It is our understanding that
the language in the Conference report was designed to preclude establishing LCV operations based on single trip permits
for infrequent truck movements. Therefore one or two movements of heavy machinery by a specialized carrier would
not create ``grandfathered rights.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA understands that for Kansas, a single trip permit would normally be issued for ``occasional use'' purposes. It
is clear that the intent of the (SVC) permit was for multiple trip purposes and not occasional ``one or two trips.''
The permit had been applied for long before the freeze language was proposed. It was only a matter of timing that so few
trips were made.

There is nothing in the ISTEA legislative history that clarifies the meaning of ``regular or periodic basis,'' but
the ATA's interpretation is plausible, especially in view of the Caltrans' response to the SNPRM. The Caltrans stated
that it

[I]ssued two permits, at the request of the California Legislature, allowing two vehicle combinations with three
26.5-foot trailers to operate from October 27 to November 5, 1971. These vehicle combinations had an overall length
of 94.25 feet with gross vehicle weights of 76,800 pounds and 90,000 pounds. The 1971 permits were issued to gather
information on truck tractor and triple trailer combination operations. The information was used to consider whether
triple combination operations should be allowed in California.

In 1983, the Caltrans issued permits for operational tests of (1) a 111,000-pound ``Triple'' (28-foot trailers)
between October 24&hyph;28; (2) a 106,850-pound ``Rocky Mountain Double'' (48-foot semitrailer, 28-foot pup)
between November 7&hyph;10; and (3) a 122,650-pound ``Turnpike Double'' (two 48-foot trailers) between November

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The brief tests performed by California one and two decades ago, which never resulted in the authorization of LCV's,
are certainly among the minimal operations that the requirement for ``regular or periodic'' use was intended to exclude.
The FHWA has therefore declined to list these vehicles in appendix C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kansas and Yellow Freight, on the other hand, clearly expected LCV's to use I&hyph;70 routinely and for years to come,
and made elaborate preparations on that basis. In addition, the KDOT's efforts to cooperate with the FHWA delayed
the issuance of the first permits, which would otherwise have been available in March 1991. On balance, the FHWA believes
that the SVC operations on I&hyph;70 satisfy the statutory standard. The Goodland route has therefore been restored
to appendix C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH commented on the accuracy of the lists of routes available to the different vehicle combinations. Appendix
C now reflects the proper route listings. Due to the SVC and Turnpike operations, the truck tractor and three trailing
unit combination does have more route mileage available to it than do two trailing unit combinations. The new route
lists show that I&hyph;70 between the Colorado State Line and Goodland is available only to SVC's with three trailing
units and not to LCV combinations with two trailing units.

The State commented that the vehicle in question is a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer where one of the cargo units

of the first trailer to the rear of the second trailer, of 58 feet, including the load. This vehicle configuration was
excluded from the original listing of LCV's in the NPRM. The exclusion was based on a definition of excepted combination
used in the NPRM (57 FR 9901, March 20, 1992) as follows:

 configurations with a maximum length of cargo-carrying units of 62 feet or less are subject to the provisions of 23

Michigan contends that the vehicle was correctly excepted in the NPRM since the Michigan vehicle clearly fell within
the length parameters of non-LCV vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion by the FHWA in the NPRM was erroneous. The vehicle was included in the SNPRM and is now in the final rule
since it can consist of a truck tractor and two trailing units and can carry more than 80,000 pounds on the Interstate
System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also commented that the ``Rocky Mountain Double_LCV'' description in the SNPRM was inappropriate for the

The State commented that the table listing vehicle combinations subject to the ISTEA, illustrating a Michigan vehicle
listed under ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' with a 128,000-pound maximum gross weight, was inappropriate. Michigan,
the State argued, is an axle weight State with a grandfather provision and maximum gross weights are determined based
on axle and axle group weight limits. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to specify a single maximum gross weight
for Michigan. The FHWA does not agree. The table and text have been revised to show a maximum allowable gross weight
of 154,000 pounds. The 154,000-pound figure was determined from the maximum axle weight limits for an 11-axle vehicle
(the maximum number of axles allowed under State law) with optimum axle spacing and with a combined cargo-carrying
box length of 58 feet. Vehicles with fewer axles or less than optimum axle spacing will have a lower allowable gross
weight based on State requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CRASH claimed that an error in available routes had been made in the SNPRM, and that the SNPRM did not include several
items that pertain to permitted loads. The CRASH not only questioned the availability of several Interstate routes
in the Kansas City metropolitan area, but also the availability of I&hyph;44 in southwest Missouri. It stated that
``the only National Network route from which LCV's can enter Missouri is I&hyph;70 in Kansas.'' Several NN routes
in Kansas and Oklahoma come up to the Missouri State Line. LCV's are allowed to operate on I&hyph;44 in Oklahoma, thus
making I&hyph;44 available to enter Missouri. In Kansas, LCV's have access to the northeastern end of the Kansas Turnpike,
over any route within a 20-mile radius. Within that 20-mile radius in Kansas, several Interstate and other highways,
which prior to passage of the ISTEA were designated as Federal-aid Primary highways, come up to the Missouri State
Line. LCV's may use any of these routes to reach terminals in Missouri which fall within a 20-mile band of the Kansas
State Line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH indicated that the State indivisible load requirement had been omitted from the SNPRM. In addition, the
CRASH contends that several operational requirements were also omitted, including those involving time-of-day
restrictions, weather requirements, oversize load signs, speed, tractor unit power, and the need for insurance.
The State responded that routine overdimension and overweight special permit issuance in Missouri is made in accordance
with State Rule 7 CSR 10&hyph;2.010 (based on Section 304.200, Revised Statutes of Missouri 1992), which provides
for a uniform administration of large and heavy loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rule (7 CSR 10&hyph;2.010) as originally promulgated by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission
disallows routing reducible loads (except for farm products) under permit, in July 1986 the State's chief engineer,
exercising other authority within the rule, authorized travel for multi-unit LCV's carrying reducible loads. To
quote Rule 7 CSR 10&hyph;2.010:

It was determined to be in the public interest to allow LCV operation to relieve economic stress and give motor carriers
the incentive to retain terminals in Missouri. Missouri would then be more competitive with adjacent western States
which allow LCV operations. The operation of LCV's has gone without reported incident, according to annual documented
safety assessments made by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, the Missouri State Highway Patrol,
the Kansas City Public Works Department, and the Kansas City Police Department.

In response to other items listed, the State made the point that Missouri Revised Statute &sect;304.200 (1992) gives
the chief engineer significant latitude in allowing the operation of LCV's, and that several items including speed
and weather restrictions are conditions of the permit issued for the operation of LCV's.

61&hyph;10&hyph;124, increased the length of Turnpike Doubles from 95 to 100 feet in length effective January 1,
1992, and, therefore, the cargo-carrying length in appendix C should be based on the shorter length. This is incorrect.

The cargo-carrying length restriction does not apply to two trailing unit combinations. The length of each trailing
unit is limited to 28.5 feet. This describes a two trailing unit vehicle whose operation is guaranteed by the STAA regardless
of inter-unit spacing. As long as each trailing unit is 28.5 feet long or less, cargo-carrying length is not restricted.
This combination is listed as an LCV because it can exceed the 80,000-pound threshold established in the congressional
definition. New Mexico has a grandfathered gross weight limit of 86,400 pounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cargo-carrying unit length for the two trailing unit combination has been listed in this final rule at 110 feet.
This length was determined after further review of docket comments submitted by the CRASH, actual operation documentation
submitted by various carriers, and the appropriate State statutes and regulations. The composite of the information
available leads the FHWA to conclude that on or before June 1, 1991, the longest legally allowed multi-unit combination
vehicle in regular or periodic use in the State consisted of a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer, wherein each of
the trailing units was 53 feet long. Combining twin 53-foot units with a 4-foot drawbar results in the 110-foot cargo-carrying
length. In the NPRM the cargo-carrying length listed for both the ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Doubles was
123 feet. In the SNPRM, 123 feet was again listed for the ``Turnpike'' Double. The 123-foot distance was the result
of combining a 4-foot drawbar with twin 59-foot 6-inch units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of establishing a cargo-carrying length subject to the freeze provisions of the ISTEA, the State incorrectly
interpreted relevant provisions of the STAA of 1982. It appears the State reasoned that since the STAA required (1)
that all States allow truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer ``Doubles'' combinations, and (2) that Oklahoma must
allow a 59-foot 6-inch semitrailer to meet the grandfather provisions of the STAA (53 FR 2599, Jan. 29, 1988), it follows
that Oklahoma must therefore allow twin 59-foot 6-inch units to operate as part of a multi-unit combination vehicle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the STAA does require all States to allow ``Doubles,'' the only applicable length requirement is that each State
must allow at least 28.5-foot trailing units. The allowance of any longer unit is at a State's discretion within the
parameters established by this final rule. The grandfathered semitrailer length applies only for truck tractor-semitrailer
combinations. The STAA requires that each State continue to allow trailers or semitrailers of such dimensions as
those that were in actual and lawful use in the State on December 1, 1982. The January 1988 rulemaking referred to earlier
established that length as 59 feet 6 inches for Oklahoma.

For purposes of establishing a cargo-carrying length subject to the freeze provisions of the ISTEA, a determination
must be made as to the unit lengths comprising combination vehicles authorized by State statute or regulation and
in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis on or before June 1, 1991. Re-examination of all submitted material
and docket comments resulted in the 110-foot length.

The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) commented that overall length requirements for three trailing unit
combinations have a significant impact on public safety and must be retained. The ODOT also said that the length of
tractors in combination with three trailing units is not a uniform 10 feet long but can range from 9 to 14 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The freeze does not affect the authority of the ODOT to enforce an overall length limit on triple-trailer combinations.
However, it does limit the overall length of the cargo-carrying units to what was authorized and in use on or before
June 1, 1991. Although the comment does not specifically indicate that 9-foot-long tractors were in use with ``Triples''
on or before June 1, 1991, we assume that was the intent. Therefore, appendix C has been changed to correct the cargo-carrying
length of three trailing unit combinations from 95 to 96 feet.

The CRASH commented that ORS 818.150(5) provides that any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety
chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables
must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached
with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel
coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated. Appendix
C has been amended accordingly.

The ODOT indicated that there is no direct relationship between approved routes for three trailing unit combinations
and the NN highways. The connection is that the freeze applies only on NN highways. Consequently, truck tractor and
three trailing unit combinations may not operate with more than 96 feet of cargo-carrying length on routes shown in
appendix C. The State is free to regulate the use of triple-trailer combinations as it sees fit on other highways.

The State said that the maximum weight limit for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' is not ``129K'' as shown on the table at
58 FR 11465&hyph;11466 of the SNPRM but is the ``Uncapped Federal Bridge Formula.'' For LCV's the maximum allowable
weight is capped at what was allowed and in actual operation on June 1, 1991. Based on the information submitted by the
State, a ``Turnpike Double,'' which must also comply with the Federal Bridge formula, is limited to a maximum of 129,000
pounds. The recategorization of the vehicles subject to the LCV freeze has adopted the 129,000-pound value for the
``Turnpike Double'' as the maximum for a truck tractor and two trailing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State showed the length of the road tractor-trailer-trailer combination as 80 feet. However, this is the overall
length. When the length determination in the SNPRM is used, the cargo-carrying length is the overall length minus
10 feet for the length of the tractor. Therefore, the cargo-carrying length of this combination is shown in appendix
C as 70 feet.

This vehicle is therefore covered by the listing for the truck tractor and two trailing unit LCV which also has a cargo-carrying
length of 68 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also commented that the length of the cargo-carrying units for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' should indicate
that the 68-foot length includes the load. We disagree. The ISTEA limited the length of cargo-carrying units, not
loads. If the State wants to prohibit, or allow, cargo overhangs over that length, it is free to do so since it retains
all the authority it possessed prior to the ISTEA to regulate cargo overhangs.

On or before June 1, 1991, Wyoming only allowed combination vehicles consisting of not more than three single vehicles.
This precluded the operation of triple-trailer combinations which consist of four single vehicles_a truck tractor,
a semitrailer, and two trailers. A provision of the ISTEA, in effect, gave the State until the next general election
day following enactment (November 3, 1992) to decide whether to allow ``Triples.'' A Statewide referendum to allow
their use was defeated in the November 3, 1992, election and, as a result, the ISTEA bars the use of ``Triples'' in Wyoming.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions relating to the length of a semitrailer in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination will not be added to
appendix C since this vehicle is not subject to the ISTEA freeze. The State DOT argued that its 60-foot semitrailer
length limit would apply to automobile and boat transporters with no overall length limit. This is not consistent
with the Federal requirement that States must allow standard automobile and boat transporters to have a minimum overall
length of 65 feet (75 feet if stinger-steered), with no specific limit on the length of the semitrailer. However, application
of the State rule does not conflict with the Federal requirement since, as a practical matter, it only applies to vehicles
longer than 65 or 75 feet. Such longer combinations would be subject to the ISTEA freeze. As a result, appendix C has
been changed to list the overall length of auto and boat transporters, since cargo is typically carried on a headrack
the same length as the tractor, in addition to the cargo on the trailer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WTA said that a truck-trailer combination falls under the definition of ``any other combination of vehicles''
in Wyoming law and, therefore, is limited to a total overall length of 85 feet with no single unit exceeding 60 feet.
While the combination is limited to 85 feet, the 60-foot limit applies only to semitrailers in a truck tractor-semitrailer
combination. The showing of 78 feet for the length of the cargo-carrying units was based on allowing 7 feet for cab length.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA said that it could not understand why the cargo-carrying length of saddlemount combinations was shown in the
SNPRM as 75 feet. Under Wyoming law it would be considered as ``any other combination'' subject to an overall length
of 85 feet. We agree. Since the tractor in a saddlemount combination is part of the cargo being transported, we have
changed the length of the cargo-carrying units for this combination to 85 feet.

TOW TRUCK OPERATIONS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nature of the service provided by wreckers or tow trucks is such that these vehicles need to have immediate access
to all roads in a State to remove disabled or abandoned, as well as accident-damaged, vehicles. They are, to that extent,
emergency vehicles. There is no evidence that Congress intended to include these operations under the freeze restrictions.
Therefore, the FHWA proposed in the SNPRM to exclude emergency towing operations from any of the freeze provisions
proposed in appendix C. Comments on this issue were received from the California and Washington DOT's and the California
Highway Patrol.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both of the California agencies recommended that proposed 23 CFR 658.23(b)(5), which would allow tow trucks and vehicles
in tow to operate on the NN without regard to the freeze on length, be amended to require a State permit to operate overlength.
This is unnecessary since 23 CFR 658.23(b)(5) merely means that they are not limited to whatever length was allowed
and in use on June 1, 1991. Since they also are not STAA vehicles, the State may regulate their length in any manner it
sees fit, including the requirement for a permit, if it wishes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Washington DOT asked if tow truck operations are restricted to the length and weight in effect on June 1, 1991. As
stated in the SNPRM, emergency towing operations are excluded from any of the freeze provisions in appendix C. However,
the proposed provisions in paragraph (b) of 23 CFR 658.23 only excluded tow trucks from the length provisions of appendix
C. In order to fully exclude emergency towing operations from any of the provisions contained in new 23 CFR 658.23,
the underlined phrase in paragraph (a)(1) has been added:

Pole Trailers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the SNPRM the FHWA proposed to list, as the authorized length for expandable trailers used for carrying poles, logs
or pipe, etc. (pole trailers), the lengths allowed by State law, even if these limits refer to the cargo rather than
the vehicle itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only five sets of comments were received which specifically addressed the issue of pole trailers. The South Dakota
DOT supported the position that the State-allowed length of the cargo should be considered the cargo-carrying length
of the unit. The State added that the FHWA should establish a national cargo overhang policy similar to that in effect
for automobile and boat transporters; that is, 3 feet in front and 4 feet to the rear of the vehicle. The Pennsylvania
DOT commented that its special length limitation (70 feet) for any combination transporting nondivisible articles
has been in place for over 20 years, and that it should be listed as Pennsylvania's length for these vehicles. The California
Highway Patrol provided that State's applicable length limits for pole or log trailers. Taking a different tack,
both the ATA and the WTA stated in their comments that pole trailers should not be considered or regulated as LCV's.
The ATA stated that the ``FHWA is incorrect in believing that establishing length limits for pole trailers is consistent
with the purpose of section 4006 of ISTEA.'' In addition to echoing the ATA's comment, the WTA went on to state that the
FHWA's proposal with regard to regulating pole trailers as an LCV, ``does not recognize that timber harvesters do
not cut logs in the same lengths all the time. Utility poles transported by telephone and power companies are not the
same length and neither are the joints of pipe used in oil well drilling, pipe line construction and water and sewer
line repair and construction.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has re-examined this issue. In the SNPRM, the FHWA admitted that the statutory language concerning the freeze
is not readily applicable to such vehicles. The discussion of pole trailers and the inclusion of these vehicles in
the SNPRM was based on an interpretation that the two cross-members on which the cargo rests constitute individual
cargo-carrying units for purposes of section 4006 of the ISTEA. That argument is difficult to maintain. In fact, the
hitch, the load, and rear dolly combine to create a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
semitrailer. The FHWA has decided not to include these vehicles in appendix C, as truck tractor-semitrailers are
not subject to the requirements of the freeze. Two separate pole trailers pulled by a tractor, however, must comply
with section 4006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Further Restrictions on ISTEA Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ISTEA provides that States may further restrict, or even prohibit, the operation of LCV's or CMV's with two or more
cargo-carrying units after June 1, 1991. Such restrictions, however, must be consistent with sections 411, 412,
and 416(a) of the STAA. This means that States may not prohibit twin trailer combinations with trailers not over 28
feet long (28.5 feet if grandfathered) from operating on the NN or reasonable access routes. States may not restrict
the width of vehicles on the NN or reasonable access routes to less than 102 inches or the metric equivalent, 102.36
inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State must notify the Secretary within 30 days after the imposition of further restrictions or prohibitions on the
operation of LCV's or CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units. The FHWA does not have approval authority over any
additional restrictions a State may impose, but is required to publish such restrictions in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FHWA may require further information or clarification before publishing the restrictions in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additional comments were received on this issue in response to the SNPRM. The proposed regulatory language in the
SNPRM directly reflected congressional intent as expressed in the ISTEA. That language has been adopted unchanged
by this final rule in &sect;658.23(e).

Minor Adjustments to Listed Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA allow States to make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature which
will relax route designations and vehicle operating restrictions in effect on June 1, 1991. They also direct the Secretary
to issue regulations establishing criteria for the States to follow in making such adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor adjustments must be both temporary and caused by an emergency. According to the Conference Report on the ISTEA
(H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 314 (1991)), such adjustments are intended to be temporary and limited,
e.g., a bridge failure that would require the rerouting of ISTEA vehicles to highways where they would otherwise be
prohibited. Since it is impossible to foresee all types of emergencies that might necessitate a minor adjustment,
and it is not the intent of the FHWA to establish a burdensome reporting requirement, the proposed regulation would
require a State to report the details of an adjustment only if the duration was expected to exceed 30 days. Emergency
adjustments with a duration of 30 days or less would not be reported to the FHWA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to cap the duration of minor adjustments at 1 year. Adjustments lasting more than 1 year would not
be considered to be of a temporary or emergency nature. Minor adjustments for the same emergency would not be permitted
to be broken into periods of less than 1 year to extend the emergency for a period longer than that. Similarly, an emergency
would not be permitted to be broken into 30-day or shorter periods to avoid reporting. The FHWA re-examined the issue
in light of the comments received to the NPRM docket. Subsequently, the SNPRM removed the NPRM's 1-year maximum duration
for a minor adjustment, but clearly spelled out that the FHWA must approve any minor adjustments which exceed 30 days.
The SNPRM proposal also clearly spelled out that rejection of a State's request would cause the immediate reimposition
of freeze restrictions, with failure to do so putting a State at risk of a funding penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two sets of comments to the SNPRM addressed the issue, those of the CRASH and those of the Advocates For Highway and Auto
Safety (Advocates). Both organizations objected to the removal of the original 1-year time limit. They feared that
under the SNPRM States would be allowed to detour LCV's onto highways less capable of safely accommodating these vehicles
for unspecified, indefinite lengths of time. The Advocates also objected to the SNPRM proposal because
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It fails to provide any criteria for the states to use in choosing alternate routes. The agency (FHWA) simply asserts
that it will exercise its discretion to review and approve or disapprove any state's request for an LCV routing adjustment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
It argues that the FHWA is reserving for itself a power to make decisions on an important issue without publicly available
guidelines which have been developed through a rulemaking process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria represented in the final rule by &sect;658.23(c) are necessarily general and rely on the review-and-approval
nature of the Federal-State relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not practical to develop specific criteria to evaluate requests which might originate for any number of reasons.
However, to allay the concerns of both the CRASH and Advocates_that minor adjustments, insofar as alternate routes
are concerned, will result in LCV's temporarily operating on highways perceived to be less safe_this final rule includes
additional guidance in selecting alternate routes. Section 658.23(c) now provides that in selecting alternate
routes, States should, to the extent possible, select routes with geometric and pavement design features equivalent
to those of the highway segment which is temporarily unavailable. In addition, each request involving an alternate
route should include a discussion of what steps the State will take to mitigate any operational and/or safety problems
that may develop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operating philosophy of the FHWA with respect to State issues has always been that of individual office autonomy
within broad national guidelines. The Division Office of Motor Carriers within each State is in the best position
to evaluate requests involving truck issues in the State. However, in order to assure that a degree of uniformity is
applied to such requests, the Regional Office of Motor Carriers must be consulted before a decision is made on a State's
request. On issues which involve alternate routes for LCV's, the final rule directs the Division Office of Motor Carriers
to coordinate with the Division Administrator before consulting with the Regional Office.

Definition of Nondivisible Loads

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of a nondivisible vehicle or load included in the NPRM was criticized by many commenters, and the following
revised definition was therefore proposed in the SNPRM:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nondivisible vehicle or load. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in this part, ``nondivisible'' means any vehicle or load exceeding applicable length or weight limits which
cannot readily be separated into smaller vehicles or loads that comply with such limits without:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compromising the intended use of the vehicle,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Destroying the value of the load, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Using expert knowledge or specially designed tools. The intended use of a vehicle would be compromised if separating
it into smaller units would make it unable to perform the function for which it was designed. The value of a load would
be destroyed if separating it into smaller units would make the load unusable for its intended purpose. Expert knowledge
means familiarity with procedures required to dismantle and reassemble a load which are beyond the job requirements
typically associated with positions in the motor carrier industry. Specially designed tools means equipment designed
and manufactured only for use with the load in question. A State may treat a sealed containerized load moving in international
commerce as a nondivisible load.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of those who responded to the SNPRM discussed nondivisible loads, but a number of comments suggested that the
scope of the definition requires clarification. The definition adopted here (and the others already codified in
23 CFR 658.5) apply, like the ISTEA freeze itself, to the same highways and vehicle characteristics as the underlying
Federal law. The following paragraphs explain that principle in more detail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Weight: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a condition of receiving Federal-aid funds, States are required to enforce Federal weight limits (23 U.S.C. 127)
on the Interstate System and on routes providing reasonable access to and from the Interstate. The penalty for failure
to do so is the withholding of a State's National Highway System (NHS) apportionment. A State may set any weight limit
it wishes on other highways, though many have voluntarily adopted Interstate limits for all roads. States are therefore
required to use the FHWA's definition only when considering whether to issue a nondivisible load permit allowing
an overweight vehicle to operate on the Interstate System and roads providing reasonable access to and from the Interstate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Length: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal laws relating to vehicle length (49 U.S.C. app. 2311 and 23 CFR 658.13, 658.23) apply to the NN of highways_see
appendix A to part 658_and routes providing reasonable access to and from the NN (49 U.S.C. app. 2312 and 23 CFR 658.19).
The Interstate is part of the larger NN, and reasonable access rights extend the reach of Federal size laws beyond the
NN itself. In contrast to Federal weight law, these provisions and the implementing regulations preempt conflicting
State laws or regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a practical matter, the FHWA definition of a nondivisible load will rarely be applied to cargo length because it
does not cover straight trucks or single-trailer combinations. It covers only loads on vehicles (1) operating on
the NN, and routes providing reasonable access to and from the NN, (2) which have two or more cargo-carrying units,
and (3) when the overall length from the front of the first to the rear of the last cargo-carrying unit exceeds the longest
such length in actual legal operation for a specific configuration on or before June 1, 1991. There are very few single
loads that rest simultaneously on the bed of a straight truck and on a trailer, or on two or more trailers. And even in
those cases, the definition would not apply unless the total cargo box length were greater than that allowed by the
State in 1991. The definition will apply more often to loads, like entire buildings, that are moved on a series of dollies,
each of which is a single cargo-carrying unit. There has been virtually no controversy about these loads, and we expect
little in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Width: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal width law (49 U.S.C. app. 2316 and 23 CFR 658.15), like the length requirements, applies on the NN and reasonable
access routes, and it preempts conflicting State laws or regulations. However, the definition of a nondivisible
load adopted by this rule does not apply to an overwidth vehicle because Federal law provides that States may issue
permits to motor vehicles more than 102 inches wide without regard to divisibility or nondivisibility (49 U.S.C.
app. 2316(c)).

The SNPRM proposed to allow States to treat containers moving in international commerce as nondivisible loads. Responses
were about equally divided. Three State transportation departments favored the proposal, while two States, the
ATA, and the Advocates opposed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Missouri said that ``(u)niformity among States to issue overweight permits for containerized loads in excess of
80,000 pounds gross weight would be a giant accomplishment.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connecticut suggested that States be required to treat sealed containerized loads moving in international commerce
as nondivisible, subject to maximum dimensions and weights it did not specify. Florida went even further, pointing
out that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
no justification is presented in the SNPRM for not affording identical containerized loads in domestic commerce
a benefit being afforded such containers in international commerce. Therefore, it is proposed that the final rule
make no reference to either international or domestic commerce and the statement in question should be revised to
read: A State may treat a sealed containerized load as a nondivisible load.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the other hand, the Washington State Patrol strongly disagreed with the proposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If that were allowed, the industry could load any container to whatever weight, claim its (sic) moving in international
commerce and obtain an overweight permit, without regard to axle, gross weight or bridge formula requirements *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a recent ``Container Weight'' study, conducted by the Washington State Patrol, it was shown that of the 3,100
vehicles transporting containers, which exceeded the legal weight limits, all but one could be transported legally
by using vehicles with the proper number of axles and axle spacings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Washington State Patrol concluded that ``(t)he proposal *&blank;*&blank;* appears to be in conflict with the
`Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992' *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the Washington DOT argued that ``(r)ather than stating a policy that the FHWA is ambivalent about whether
the states allow containerized cargo to be treated as non-divisible, it would seem better to encourage a national
policy that they are not. This would alleviate competition on this point among ports to make their services more amenable
to haulers and shippers.'' South Dakota contended that ``(j)ust because the container is `sealed' or is `moving in
international commerce' should not preclude a loaded container from meeting the same size and weight requirements
which exists for a load which is loaded in a container, such as a truck box, not `sealed' and not `moving in international
commerce.'''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA recommended that the proposal to allow containers to be treated as nondivisible loads be dropped and that the
issue be addressed in the rulemaking to implement the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advocates argued that the FHWA had ``openly contravened Congressional intent'' expressed in section 4006 of
the ISTEA ``by explicitly endorsing the prospective regular issuance of such permits for any `sealed containerized
cargo in international commerce.'''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FHWA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA agrees that there is a serious question whether the proposal to allow States to treat containers in international
commerce as nondivisible loads is consistent with the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992 (Safe
Container Act) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;548, 106 Stat. 3646, partly codified at 49 U.S.C. 508). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Briefly, the Safe Container Act requires the party tendering a loaded intermodal container or trailer with a cargo
weight in excess of 10,000 pounds to provide the initial carrier a written certification of the cargo weight and a reasonable
description of the contents. Each carrier in the intermodal chain is required to transmit the certification to the
next carrier. Motor carriers are prohibited from hauling loaded intermodal containers or trailers subject to the
Safe Container Act without receiving a certification. It is also illegal to coerce a motor carrier to haul such a container
or trailer (1) without a certification or (2) when the certified weight would make the combination vehicle exceed
applicable State weight limits. There are two statutory options if State enforcement personnel discover an overweight
tractor-chassis-intermodal container (or tractor-intermodal semitrailer) combination which is on the highway
because the motor carrier relied on a false or erroneous certified weight. First, the State is authorized to assess
the overweight fine against the initial tenderer and to impound the container or trailer until that party or the beneficial
owner of the cargo has paid the fine. Second, if the State fines the motor carrier instead of trying to collect from the
shipper or beneficial owner, the motor carrier has a lien on the contents of the container or trailer equal to the amount
of the fine imposed and any additional costs incurred in the incident until it receives payment from the tenderer or
beneficial owner. If payment is not made within a reasonable time, the carrier may sell the contents to satisfy the
lien. The FHWA's proposed regulations to implement the Safe Container Act were published on July 14, 1993, at 58 FR
37895. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Safe Container Act imposes administrative requirements and costs on tens of thousands of intermodal shippers
around the world, and on the international transportation system, in part to reduce the number of overweight containers
operating on the Nation's highways. The Safe Container Act is designed to give U.S. motor carriers enough information
about the weight and cargo characteristics of intermodal containers and trailers to enable them to decide whether
a particular vehicle can be transported without violating State weight limits. If States were allowed to continue
routinely to issue nondivisible load permits for overweight containers, some of the essential purposes of the Safe
Container Act would appear to be compromised. There would be little incentive for shippers to load intermodal containers
or trailers with U.S. weight limits in mind, little if any reduction in the number of overweight vehicles (even though
a permit makes them legal), and little reduction in pavement and bridge damage. Many of the expected benefits of the
Safe Container Act would be lost, and the regulatory burdens it entails for shippers and carriers would be pointless,
if the FHWA adopted the rule on containers proposed in the SNPRM. The FHWA has therefore decided not to promulgate a

The members of the Specialized Carriers &amp; Rigging Association (SCRA) often move loads that would qualify as nondivisible
by any definition. The SCRA noted that the definition proposed by the SNPRM explained expert knowledge as familiarity
with procedures required to dismantle and reassemble a load which are ``beyond the job requirements typically associated
with positions in the motor carrier industry.'' The Association argued that because highly specialized skills are
typically associated with positions in its segment of the motor carrier industry, the definition would make it impossible
for special carriers and riggers to obtain nondivisible load permits.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA agrees that a test based on ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' is too complicated and ambiguous
to be effective. It has therefore been replaced with a test based on the time required to divide a load. This general
approach was suggested by the Oregon DOT in response to the NPRM. The full definition adopted by this rule is as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nondivisible load or vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As used in this part, ``nondivisible'' means any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits
which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, i.e., make it unable to perform the function for which it was intended;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, i.e., make it unusable for its intended purpose; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Require more than 8 workhours to dismantle using appropriate equipment. The applicant for a nondivisible load
permit has the burden of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A State may treat emergency response vehicles and casks designed and used for the transport of spent nuclear materials
as nondivisible vehicles or loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first two tests proposed in the SNPRM, and adopted here as paragraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii), have elicited little
comment and no controversy. These standards are appropriate but very stringent. The FHWA believes there are loads
that could be divided without literally destroying their value, but only after unreasonable delay and expense to
the shipper and motor carrier; the States should be allowed to issue nondivisible load permits in those cases. As the
Pennsylvania DOT recognized, this is essentially an ``economic criterion.'' Our earlier proposals to codify this
idea would have allowed nondivisible load permits if dismantling the load imposed ``significant additional costs
on the shipper or motor carrier'' (NPRM) or required ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' (SNPRM). The
final rule uses 8 workhours, i.e., a full working day, as a proxy for nondivisibility. The number of workhours required
by the rule is the same no matter how many people are involved; for example, if one person working 8 hours, 2 people working
4 hours each, or 4 people working 2 hours apiece, could not dismantle the load, it would be nondivisible. Most loads
that require more than one full workday to dismantle, using appropriate equipment, probably were not designed to
be taken apart after leaving the factory. We believe Congress intended to allow the use of nondivisible load permits
for cargoes which are theoretically divisible, but so tightly integrated that they cannot be dismantled without
excessive cost and delay. On the other hand, the definition sets a standard high enough to keep easily divided overweight
machinery and equipment off the highway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition adopted today as paragraph (1)(iii) is more objective than that proposed in the NPRM and less confusing
than the amended version included in the SNPRM. It remains complex, however, and disagreements between enforcement
officers, motor carriers, and shippers are likely. The rule does not specify how State officials are to determine
the length of time required to break down a given load. Manufacturers may sometimes provide the necessary information.
The motor carrier itself may have reliable data if it has previously dismantled such cargoes. The rule does not require
a carrier or shipper to demonstrate that a given load cannot be broken down in less than 8 workhours, but it would not
prohibit a State from requiring such a demonstration either. Enforcement officials may be able to work out other reliable
methods in cooperation with motor carriers. Paragraph (1)(iii) requires that ``appropriate equipment'' be used
in an effort to dismantle a cargo. The number of workers involved and the type of equipment used will depend on the load
to be moved. A State is not required to grant a permit in any case, and it would certainly be reasonable to deny a permit
to a carrier or shipper which makes a perfunctory or deliberately inadequate effort to dismantle a load within 8 workhours.

Overweight and Overwidth Vehicles: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In many cases, nondivisible load permits are likely to be requested for loads which are both overweight and overwidth.
The South Dakota DOT favored the definition of a nondivisible load adopted by the Western Association of State Highway
Officials (WASHTO), which includes the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Portions of a load can be detached and reloaded on the same hauling unit provided that the separate pieces are necessary
to the operation of the machine or equipment which is being hauled, if the arrangement does not exceed permittable
limits.

For example, suppose that a ten foot wide crawler tractor with a fourteen foot wide dozer is to be moved. This load can
be moved two ways, overweight and fourteen feet wide with the dozer and ten feet wide without the dozer. Clearly the
safest way to move the load would be legal weight and ten feet wide but separating the dozer from the crawler tractor
destroys the unit for its intended use and it requires expert knowledge to take the dozer off.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has misread the FHWA's proposed definition. Although a bulldozer might be temporarily ``unusable for its
intended purpose'' without a blade, that phrase merely clarifies the term ``destroy the value of the load.'' Removing
the blade certainly would not destroy the value of the bulldozer. The ``expert knowledge'' test has been eliminated,
but it is unclear whether a blade would require more than 8 workhours to remove. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flaw in the WASHTO definition is that it allows the separate pieces of an allegedly nondivisible load to be reloaded
onto the same vehicle. That defeats the purpose of such a provision, which is to hold down vehicle weights in order to
protect the public investment in roads and bridges. The WASHTO definition simply allows a divisible load permit to
masquerade as a nondivisible load permit. That is unacceptable.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FHWA seems to assume that all overlength (and over-width) loads are also overweight. Much of the equipment used in
agriculture is oversize, but not overweight. Allowing the removal of a portion of this type of machinery such as tires
and allowing it to be carried on the same trailer is clearly in the public interest, especially when in all respects,
the machinery is otherwise eligible for a nondivisible load permit. Requiring a second vehicle to haul the removed
part(s) is not smart economics.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a piece of farm machinery is overwidth but not overweight, the State may either issue an overwidth permit, make the
permit conditional upon the removal of tires but allow them to be carried on the same trailer, or deny a permit. These
options are entirely within the discretion of the State. If farm machinery is neither overwidth nor overweight, the
question of divisibility would not arise unless two or more cargo-carrying units were needed to transport it, certainly
a rare occurrence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
California Policy: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Highway Patrol also argued that ``there are incidents involving the transportation of some nondivisible
loads, when more than one unit is loaded, (and) can be transported safely. To qualify, loads would have to be oversize,
rather than overweight in nature. California permit policy allows the transportation of multiple nondivisible
pieces together, provided sufficient supporting justification is given.'' The Caltrans asked for a definition
that allows this kind of flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States may allow several nondivisible overwidth loads on the same vehicle, as long as the normal weight limits are
observed. That appears to be what California authorizes. As mentioned above, Federal law gives the States great discretion
in issuing permits for overwidth loads. There would also be no conflict with Federal regulations if a State allowed
more than one overlength nondivisible load to be carried on a single trailer vehicle_assuming the vehicle was not
overweight_because the FHWA's definition of a nondivisible load applies only to overlength nondivisible loads
carried on two or more cargo-carrying units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. C79&hyph;057B, an unreported 1979 Wyoming Federal district court decision, in support of the proposition that
safety should be considered in any definition of nondivisible loads. Rocky Mountain Prestress manufactured concrete
panels that were to be mounted, two at a time, on A-frame trailers and transported from Denver to Casper for use in construction
projects. Wyoming law allowed special permits for overweight ``indivisible loads,'' but the Highway Department
rejected plaintiff's application on the ground that two panels were a divisible load. Plaintiff sued the Chief Engineer
of the Department, arguing among other things that Wyoming's permit law violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.
The court held the law constitutional, but found that it had been applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner which
impermissibly burdened interstate commerce. The court explained that:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Our conclusion is buttressed by the admission of the Defendants that heavy equipment which is being carried by trailer
qualifies as an indivisible load even though the parts thereof may be easily dismantled. Such an approach to granting
overweight permits signifies that the State Highway Department has previously, as they must in this case, considered
circumstances other than the mere physical divisibility of the goods in transit.

We would also observe that forestry goods, baled hay and sugar beets are statutory exceptions to the mandated weight
limits. The special interest group exceptions in the Wyoming statutes discriminate against the Plaintiff and others
similarly situated who may be equally deserving of exceptions from the weight limitation in view of the safety and
economic factors involved. *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* [T]he State's desire to protect its highways has been severely diluted by the discriminatory
granting of overweight permits to special interest groups, as well as by the routine issuance of such permits based
on an indivisible load regulatory provision that we believe was arbitrarily and capriciously applied to the Plaintiff.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The court concluded that ``the `A' frame is the safest *&blank;*&blank;* mode of transportation for loading and shipping
panels,'' but its evidence on that point was meager. The issue of safe transportation of concrete panels was discussed
at some length in the SNPRM (see 58 FR 11455&hyph;11457). As we noted there, a single panel, mounted horizontally,
would improve the vehicle's braking capability and reduce its susceptibility to side winds. Two such panels obviously
constitute a divisible load, and a ``safety'' rationale for doubling the weight of a divisible load is not persuasive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Hills Trucking now contends that one panel cannot be carried horizontally because it ``is not constructed to
stand up to forces coming through its sides,'' or vertically ``because it is not heavy enough in proportion to the `sail'
area exposed to side winds which destabilize the load.'' The apparent fragility of these concrete panels does not
make two of them any less divisible. Furthermore, the Great Plains experience winds high enough to overturn tractor
trailer combinations and double-stack container trains. The interests of safety are better served by halting trucking
operations under those conditions than by doubling the weight of the cargo in an effort to anchor the vehicle.

decision is not binding on the FHWA. To the extent this rule requires Wyoming to adopt and enforce a new definition for
purposes of issuing nondivisible load overweight permits for the Interstate System, it is no longer binding on the
State either. The 1979 decision was based upon the State's arbitrary and capricious administration of its own permit
law, in particular its failure to apply that law consistently to all motor carriers and commodities. At the time, there
was no Federal law on nondivisible loads. Congress enacted nondivisible load provisions for vehicle weight in 1982
and for vehicle length in 1991. Proposed regulations to implement that authority have been subjected to extensive
comment and discussion in this rulemaking. Wyoming, like the other States, will be required to adopt the new definition
for Interstate operations. That definition will result in greatly increased nationwide uniformity in the treatment
of nondivisible loads. Wyoming will have no more administrative discretion than any other State. A judicial challenge
to the FHWA's definition of a nondivisible load would therefore confront a legal and factual situation completely
different from that which existed in 1979.

Emergency Vehicles: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1023(e)(1) of the ISTEA prohibited the FHWA from penalizing States that allow emergency vehicles to use the
Interstate at weights in excess of Federal axle and Bridge Formula limits. The exemption was in effect for 2 years after
the date of enactment of the ISTEA and expired on December 18, 1993. Section 1023(e) also required a study of State laws
and permit practices to determine whether statutory changes were needed to accommodate emergency vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To carry out the study, the FHWA requested comments on a variety of questions (57 FR 46941, October 13, 1992). The information
submitted indicated that most fire trucks exceed the Federal single- and/or tandem-axle weight limits (20,000 and
34,000 pounds, respectively). These vehicles are rarely short enough to violate the Bridge Formula, however, and
almost all of them have gross weights under 80,000 pounds. Technological developments in the manufacturing sector
combined with the equipment preferences of fire departments are driving up the size and, especially, the weight of
fire trucks. On the other hand, tandem and tridem axles are not favored because they reduce the maneuverability these
vehicles need to reach burning buildings. Some States exempt fire equipment from normal weight limits, and others
issue blanket overweight permits. The Caltrans reached a compromise with fire officials that will require the latter
to observe specific axle limits for various types of vehicles and to make purchasing decisions accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. DOT's report was transmitted to Congress on September 7, 1993. It recommended that Congress take no further
action because the matter could be resolved by an FHWA policy statement. On November 9, 1993, the Federal Highway Administrator
informed the FHWA's regional offices, and through them the States, that ``the FHWA will not withhold Federal-aid
funds from States which issue nondivisible load permits to emergency vehicles equipped for their intended use. We
will not require that the vehicles have a full crew or be operating under emergency conditions. States may set whatever
permit terms, conditions, and fees they consider appropriate.'' The Federal Highway Administrator added that this
policy ``is compatible with the Agency's draft definition'' published on February 25, 1993, in the SNPRM and that
if it ``in any way conflicts with the definition ultimately adopted through the rulemaking process, appropriate
action will be taken to amend or rescind the policy.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Federal Highway Administrator's decision was based upon conclusions set forth in his November 9, 1993, letter:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some States may have refused to issue nondivisible load permits to emergency vehicles because much of their equipment
is readily detachable. Fire trucks often carry firefighting teams, water, hoses, axes, respirators and other devices;
advanced life support vehicles typically carry at least two paramedics (one of whom drives), defibrillators, oxygen
tanks, stretchers, and medical supplies. In one sense, ancillary equipment and personnel are ``divisible'' parts
of the load, and removing them might lighten an emergency vehicle enough to restore compliance with Interstate weight
limits. Doing so, however, would defeat the purpose of these vehicles and make it impossible for them to respond effectively
to emergencies. New vehicles may even be overweight as they leave the final stage manufacturing facility, either
because the base vehicle is particularly heavy or because ancillary equipment is supplied with it. The equipment
that could be removed from emergency vehicles to reduce weight is essential to the services they are designed to perform.
These vehicles and loads are functionally if not physically nondivisible, and I believe the States should have the
option to treat them as such.

In the language of the regulation we are adopting today, requiring an emergency vehicle to unload separable pieces

Spent Nuclear Fuel:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pennsylvania DOT pointed out that the FHWA informed the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials several years ago that the FHWA regards overweight casks used to move spent nuclear fuel as nondivisible.
This determination was not reflected in the SNPRM. The casks used to transport spent nuclear materials, especially
nuclear fuel, are extraordinarily strong and heavy, both to prevent a release in case the transporter vehicle was
involved in an accident and to block radiation that would penetrate lighter materials. Some of these containment
devices can make a vehicle overweight even before the nuclear materials are loaded. These vehicles cannot be used
for any other cargo or reduced to legal weights without frustrating their purpose. A new provision has therefore been
added which essentially states that specially designed casks used to move spent nuclear fuel meet the definition
of a nondivisible load.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Connecticut DOT suggested that we use the definition of a nondivisible load to establish ``an Ultimate Limit or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA mentioned in the SNPRM that bulk commodities such as liquids, grain, and cement are inherently divisible.
The CRASH suggested that the definition include ``a much more complete listing of loads that are inherently divisible
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' In view of the enormous variety of products that move by truck, we do not believe divisible
loads could reasonably be itemized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grove Worldwide, a manufacturer of cranes, proposed that a load be defined as nondivisible if dismantling it would
cause a competitive disadvantage, compromise the integrity and safety of the equipment when disassembled, or jeopardize
the warranty. The FHWA considers these tests too far removed from the question of physical divisibility to be appropriate.

published today as appendix C to 23 CFR part 658. Any person or State may request that the Secretary review the final
list to determine if there is cause to believe that it contains a mistake. The Secretary may also initiate the review.
If the Secretary believes an error exists, he or she must commence a proceeding to determine if the list should be corrected,
and if so, make the correction. Proposed language establishing such a procedure was included in the SNPRM. No comments
were received on this issue. Accordingly, that language has been adopted, unchanged, by this final rule in &sect;658.23(f).

Temporary Exemption for Public Transit Vehicles

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1023 of the ISTEA was amended by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act
for fiscal year (FY) 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;388, 106 Stat. 1520. Section 341 added a new subsection (h) which reads
in part as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporary Exemption._The second sentence of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, relating to axle weight
limitations for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, shall not apply,
in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively
used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus. The Secretary may extend such 2-year period for an additional
year. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This prevents the FHWA from sanctioning States that fail to enforce the Interstate axle-weight limits for public
transit vehicles at least until October 6, 1994. If the Secretary exercises the authority to extend the exemption
an additional year, it would apply until October 6, 1995. The 2-year exemption was included in the ISTEA to allow States
to suspend axle weight enforcement on the Interstate System against public transit vehicles while the Secretary
conducts the study called for in section 1023(h)(2). That study, which is currently underway, is to determine whether
or not public transit vehicles should be exempted from the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 127, State weight laws, or if such
laws should be modified to accommodate these vehicles. The FHWA and the Federal Transit Administration published
a joint notice and request for comments on this issue on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60481). A report on the results of the
study, along with recommendations, will ultimately be submitted by the Secretary to Congress.

In a comment to the SNPRM docket, the American Public Transit Association urged that the temporary exemption language
be codified into part 658. The FHWA agrees with this comment. Accordingly, the exemption is codified in this final
rule at &sect;658.17(k).

Temporary Exemption for Emergency Vehicles

Section 1023(e) of the ISTEA added the following exemption from 23 U.S.C. 127:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Temporary Exemption._The second sentence of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, relating to axle weight
limitations and the bridge formula for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways,
shall not apply, in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to any existing vehicle which
is used for the purpose of protecting persons and property from fires and other disasters that threaten public safety
and which is in actual operation before such date of enactment and to any new vehicle to be used for such purpose while
such vehicle is being delivered to a fire fighting agency. The Secretary may extend such 2-year period for an additional
year.

This prevented the FHWA from sanctioning States that failed to enforce the Interstate axle-weight and Bridge Formula
limits for fire or emergency vehicles in actual operation on or before December 18, 1991, and for such equipment being
delivered from the manufacturer to a fire department. The normal gross weight limit was not affected by the exemption.
The exemption remained in effect through December 18, 1993. The SNPRM proposed to codify the exemption at &sect;658.17(k).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received on this issue. The South Dakota DOT expressed its desire to go on record as ``not in favor
of allowing a temporary or permanent axle weight exemption or bridge formula weight exemption for emergency vehicles.''
The State contends that ``operation of these vehicles overweight threatens the public's safety'' and ``that emergency
vehicles should be designed to operate within legal size and weight limits.'' The Caltrans objected to the FHWA's
interpretation of the law which indicated that the normal gross weight limit (80,000 pounds) remained in effect during
the period of the exemption. They contend that gross weight is determined by the Bridge Formula and that our interpretation
was contradictory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that Congress intended the exemption in section 1023(e)(1) to cover (1) single- and tandem-axle
limits, (2) application of the bridge formula to intermediate axles (the inner bridge limits), and (3) application
of the Bridge Formula to the overall wheelbase of the vehicle (the outer bridge limit). However, the 80,000-pound
maximum gross weight allowed by 23 U.S.C. 127(a) is not inherently part of the Bridge Formula. It is a separate statutory
restriction, and we do not believe Congress intended to authorize an exemption to the 80,000-pound limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 2-year exemption was included in the ISTEA to allow States to suspend enforcement action against these vehicles
while the Secretary conducted the study called for in section 1023(e)(2). That study has been completed, as indicated
above, and the authority of the Secretary to extend the temporary exemption an additional year will not be exercised.
The temporary exemption expired December 18, 1993. However, the definition of a nondivisible load adopted in this
final rule specifically declares emergency vehicles to be nondivisible. States may therefore issue overweight
permits for these vehicles if they wish.

Interstate System Weight Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first sentence in 23 U.S.C. 127(a) was amended by the STAA of 1982 to require all States to allow the maximum weights
permitted by Federal law on the Interstate System. In effect, the weight limits set forth in section 127 became minimums
which the States must allow, as well as the maximums the States could allow, on the Interstate System. Since the STAA
amendment of section 127 became effective (January 6, 1983), States have occasionally argued that the amendment
applied only to the single-axle, tandem-axle, and maximum gross weight limits, and not to gross weights developed
by the Bridge Formula. In addition, a degree of confusion regarding applicability has lingered over the years as a
result of the regulations issued to implement the STAA (49 FR 23302, June 5, 1984). Although those regulations were
published 11/2 years after enactment of the STAA, the statutory action making the weight value minimums was not highlighted
nor was any regulatory language included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNPRM proposed to clarify and resolve this issue by including a &sect;658.17(f) as follows. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a single axle,
34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the bridge formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including
all enforcement tolerances.

Comments on this proposal were received from six State Departments of Transportation (Arizona, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington), as well as from the WASHTO's Subcommittee on Highway Transport. All seven
commenters objected to the paragraph as proposed for fear that it would no longer allow the States to further control
axle weight using a regulation based on pounds per inch of tire width. Each of the six States providing direct comments
currently has this type of weight control regulation in force. The ``Guide For Uniform Laws and Regulations Governing
Truck Size and Weight Among the WASHTO States,'' prepared by the WASHTO Subcommittee on Highway Transport and adopted
by the WASHTO Policy Committee on June 26, 1993, recommends that all 17 member States adopt a 600-pound/inch tire width
weight control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State tire loading regulations are intended to limit the use of single tires or wheels designed for dual tire applications.
This is a practice which results in higher pavement stress and shorter pavement life, and greatly reduces the safety
margin provided by dual tires. Depending on the pound-per-inch limit chosen, these regulations may also restrict
the use of some ``super single'' tires. The Washington State DOT included in its docket comments a copy of a report of
research on the effects of wide based single tires on flexible pavements conducted by the FHWA at our Pavement Testing
Facility during 1989 and 1990. Dual 11R22.5 radial tires, previously identified as one of the most common truck tires
in use today, were tested against a 425/65R22.5 wide base single tire. Under a load rating methodology established
by the United States Tire and Rim Association, the load ratings for the duals and the single are equivalent; however,
the footprint on the pavement is significantly different. The approximate footprint of an 11R22.5 tire is 8.5 inches.
Thus, two sets of duals (four tires) can result in approximately 34 inches of tire being available to transmit an axle
load to the pavement. For the 425/65R22.5 wide base tire, the footprint is approximately 11 inches, which would make
approximately 22 inches available to transmit an axle load to the pavement. The research demonstrated that the 425/65R22.5
wide based single tire was significantly more damaging to conventional flexible pavements than the traditional
11R22.5 dual tires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal axle weight limits on the Interstate System were adopted to protect the tremendous Federal investment
in that System. Restrictions on the weight a tire may carry, based on its width, are consistent with that goal and not
forbidden by Federal law. It would be anomalous to adopt axle weight limits to protect Interstate System pavements
and then prevent States from blocking the use of tires so narrow that much of the protection was lost. In addition, a
pound-per-inch tire limit does not directly limit the weight that an axle may carry, since additional or wider tires
may be utilized. Therefore, unless such restrictions operate so that, as a practical matter, axles cannot be loaded
to the Federal weight limits, they are not inconsistent with 23 U.S.C. 127. We believe that laws limiting tire weights
as low as 500 pounds per inch width of tire or tread width will allow axles to be loaded to the Federal axle weight limits
without particular difficulty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steering axles must be treated differently, however, since they cannot always be equipped with wider or additional
tires. The FHWA has already recognized a different standard for steering axles by not requiring States to allow truckers
to load them to 20,000 pounds when the manufacturer's weight rating is less than that. Therefore, States may not impose
pound-per-inch restrictions that would reduce the allowed weight of steering axles on the Interstate System to less
than 20,000 pounds or the manufacturer's weight rating, whichever is lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arizona, Montana, and Oregon also suggested that proposed &sect;658.17(f) be amended to allow temporary weight
restrictions based on climatic conditions or emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some northern States have for decades enforced lower axle limits during spring thaw. When moisture in a pavement's
sub-base, frozen during the winter months, begins to melt, the load-carrying capacity of the pavement structure
is reduced until the moisture drains. The degree of reduction is a function of the overall pavement structure thickness,
the type of underlying material, amount of moisture, and depth of frost penetration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal weight restrictions apply only to the Interstate System. The standards to which the System has been built
include pavement designs developed with the strength to allow maximum legal weights year round. The FHWA does not
agree that there is a need to provide regulatory flexibility for climatic conditions. The pavement design parameters
of the Interstate System preclude the need for this authority. However, the States do retain the authority to establish
such restrictions for highways that are not part of the Interstate System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Emergency'' weight restrictions requested by States generally are not restrictions at all, but rather the lessening
of restrictions to allow heavier weights. For example, when natural disasters occur, carriers, relief agencies,
or States would often like to allow trucks carrying relief supplies to exceed normal weight limits. Federal law simply
does not allow waivers of this kind. On the other hand, if a flood or earthquake has seriously weakened a bridge or stretch
of pavement, it remains within the police powers of the State or municipality to close or limit access to the facility
in order to protect the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the three exceptions to &sect;658.17(f) sought by commenters, the FHWA agrees that States should retain the authority
to enforce the tire loading restrictions, but does not concur in the request to provide climatic or emergency restrictions.
Accordingly, &sect;658.17(f), as proposed in the SNPRM, is amended to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;658.17

(f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000
pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum
of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 pounds per
inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit
steering axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established by the manufacturer, whichever is
lower.

Bus Length and Access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4006(b)(1) of the ISTEA amended section 411(a) of the STAA [49 U.S.C. app. 2311(a)] by inserting ``of less
than 45 feet on the length of any bus,'' after ``vehicle length limitation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4006(b)(2) of the ISTEA amended section 412(a)(2) of the STAA [49 U.S.C. app. 2312(a)(2)] by inserting ``motor
carrier of passengers'' after ``household goods carriers.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first provision has the effect of requiring States to allow buses with a length of 45 feet or less on the NN and reasonable
access routes. The second provision requires States to allow motor carriers of passengers to have the same access
off the NN as household goods carriers, i.e., to ``points of loading and unloading.'' In the SNPRM, the FHWA proposed
changes to the ``Length'' and ``Reasonable Access'' sections of part 658 to account for these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on this proposal were received from the Caltrans and the Department of California Highway Patrol. Both agencies
recommended that a final rule include definitions of both ``bus'' and ``motor carrier of passengers'' to ``prevent
confusion on the interpretation and application of the regulations.'' The FHWA agrees with this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The STAA defines a ``commercial motor vehicle'' in part as ``any self-propelled *&blank;*&blank;* vehicle used
on the highways in [interstate] commerce principally to transport passengers *&blank;*&blank;* (B) if such vehicle
is designed to transport more than 10 passengers, including the driver *&blank;*&blank;*'' (49 U.S.C. app. 2301(1)(B)).
While this definition applies only to subchapter I of chapter 32 of title 49, U.S.C., which makes grants available
to States that agree to enforce Federal, or compatible State, safety regulations, it is an indication of congressional
intent. For purposes of administering the commercial vehicle safety program, ``bus'' was defined in 49 CFR 390.5
as ``any motor vehicle designed, constructed, and or used for the transportation of passengers, including taxicabs.''
The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 amended the definition of a bus to a ``vehicle designed to transport more than 15
passengers, including the driver *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (49 U.S.C. app. 2503(1)(B)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of Congress, as expressed in the ISTEA, is to guarantee national route availability and reasonable access
for ``buses'' not exceeding 45 feet in length. Since virtually all States already allowed 40-foot buses to operate
Statewide prior to the ISTEA, the number of passengers the vehicle is designed to carry is not an issue, simply the establishment
of a national standard length. Accordingly, this final rule will use the most generic of the definitions already established,
that found in 49 CFR 390.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the term ``motor carrier of passengers'' has not previously been defined, this type of operation can generally
be characterized as belonging to at least one of three groups: (1) Common carriers that offer service on regular (and
sometimes on irregular) routes, (2) contract carriers that provide charter service to groups, or (3) private carriers
that do not serve the public but use buses as part of some other enterprise. Someone who uses a 45-foot bus for recreational
or other non-business purposes would not qualify as a motor carrier of passengers. For this final rule ``motor carrier
of passengers'' is defined as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fruehauf Trailer Corporation (Fruehauf) commented that the FHWA should clarify the methods by which length is determined
for trailers which are part of a multi-unit vehicle subject to the freeze. Because of the attention focused on the LCV
length issue by the freeze, Fruehauf contends that it is important that all States (and enforcement agencies) have
a uniform understanding of how the length of the individual units is to be determined. Fruehauf's specific concern
is with full trailers used in LCV's which are actually made up of a semitrailer and a converter dolly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a Notice of Interpretation (NOI) published on March 13, 1987, at 52 FR 7834, the FHWA addressed the issue of trailer
or semitrailer length, as part of an overall discussion of length and width exclusive devices. The first length interpretation

1. The length of a semitrailer equipped with an upper coupler (mates with a truck tractor fifth wheel) and a full trailer
(with either a permanently mounted dolly or equipped with a converter dolly) is to be measured from the front vertical
plane of the foremost transverse load carrying structure to the rear vertical plane of the rearmost transverse load
carrying structure. The towbar of a full trailer is excluded from the length measurement (of that trailer) since,
technically, it carries no load, but rather it is the means by which the trailer unit is drawn.

determination of these units.

This final rule will also amend appendix A to 23 CFR part 658, National Network_Federally-Designated Routes, to reflect
the inclusion of the I&hyph;580 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge (toll) in the NN. Under the STAA, all Interstate System
routes are part of the NN unless deletion is authorized by law. The I&hyph;580 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge was withheld
from the NN until a direct connection to I&hyph;80 from the east end of the bridge could be completed. This condition
was reflected in Note 1 to the California listing of NN routes in appendix A. Now that this connection has been completed,
the FHWA is amending appendix A by removing Note 1 and redesignating Note 2 as ``Note.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment will merely reflect the fact that the I&hyph;580 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge is now included in the
NN pursuant to the provisions of the STAA. For this reason, and the others set forth above, the FHWA has determined that
prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this action are unnecessary. Furthermore, due to the technical
nature of this amendment, the FHWA has determined that prior notice and opportunity for comment are not required under
the U.S. Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, as it is not anticipated that such action
will result in receipt of useful information.

The ISTEA freeze applies to the operation of specified CMV's on the Interstate and other portions of the NN. The identification
of NN routes in Virginia contained in appendix A to 23 CFR part 658 utilizes Interstate System exit numbers to identify
the beginning or end of some NN routes. During 1992, the State converted all Interstate System exit numbers from a consecutive
number system to a milepost numbering system. In response to this portion of the SNPRM, the State indicated that there
appeared to be a discrepancy between what was published in the SNPRM and what the State was considering to be its NN.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State list not only includes those highway sections designated by the Secretary which comprise appendix A to part
658, but also additional segments which the State has also decided to open to STAA vehicles. Each State retains the
authority to open additional mileage, beyond what is listed in appendix A of part 658, to STAA vehicles without the
approval of the Secretary. In order to identify NN routes in Virginia which have been federally designated, we are
reissuing the State's NN routes in appendix A, 23 CFR part 658, to reflect the new milepost-based exit numbers.

 means a truck tractor combined with a semi-trailer and a separable cargo-carrying unit which is designed to be loaded

Although the term maxi-cube was intended to apply to a specific combination of straight truck and trailing unit, the
1987 language described the power unit as a ``truck tractor,'' which the STAA elsewhere defines as ``the noncargo
carrying power unit that operates in combination with a semitrailer or trailer *&blank;*&blank;* `` (49 U.S.C. app.
2311(f)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Theoretically, therefore, the maxi-cube is a noncargo-carrying power unit combined with a semitrailer and a separable
cargo-carrying unit which is designed to be loaded and unloaded through the semi-trailer. Unfortunately, this vehicle
is a chimera. The separable cargo-carrying unit cannot be placed on the ``noncargo carrying'' power unit, and if it
were placed on the semitrailer, the result would seem to be a truck tractor-chassis-intermodal container combination.
Container vehicles had long been legal, however, so the 1987 language certainly was not directed at them. In some sense
all containers and semitrailers are designed to be loaded and unloaded ``through'' themselves, but the description
does not really fit a combination with only one cargo-carrying unit. The fact is that the definition of the vehicle
to be authorized did not correspond to the actual vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing the problem, Congress amended the STAA again in 1990 to make maxi-cubes ``specialized equipment'' and
thus eligible for the special regulatory treatment authorized by 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(d). The accompanying report
of the House Appropriations Committee said the following:

The bill includes language (Sec. 327) amending section 411(d) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982
regarding maxi-cube vehicles. A maxi-cube vehicle is a truck combination consisting of a power unit capable of carrying
cargo that pulls a semitrailer. The power unit is a single or tandem axle truck that carries either a detachable or a
permanently attached cargo box or platform. The trailing unit is a semitrailer attached to the front unit by a specially
built draw bar which gives the entire combination a single point of articulation. The front of the rear unit is specially
designed so cargo may be loaded through the rear unit to the front unit. The length of the trailing cargo unit can be no
more than 34 feet excluding the draw bar. The distance from the front of the cargo box on the power unit to the rear of the
trailing unit can be no more than 60 feet.

Although this is an accurate description of a maxi-cube, the flawed definition of the same vehicle in 49 U.S.C. app.
2311(f)(2) was not repealed. In the SNPRM, the FHWA therefore exercised its broad discretionary authority over specialized
equipment to propose a definition of the maxi-cube that largely codified the policy guidance of the Committee Report
while omitting or modifying the erroneous parts of the statutory definition. We believe this is consistent with the
principle that ambiguous or confusing statutes must be interpreted and implemented in a manner that minimizes difficulties
and produces the most sensible result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of a maxi-cube proposed in the SNPRM has been adopted in this final rule, with slight modifications
for clarity. It should be noted that the word ``semitrailer'' used in the statute and Committee Report has been changed
to ``trailer or semitrailer,'' since some of the vehicles built as maxi-cubes in recent years are equipped with pintle-hooks,
non-load-bearing hitches used for full trailers. Others are equipped with load-bearing fifth-wheel hitches typical
of semitrailers. This modification of the definition is well within the FHWA's authority to promulgate rules to accommodate
specialized equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNPRM also proposed that maxi-cube vehicles should be measured with the adjustable-length drawbar (if so equipped)
at its maximum extension, since we assumed that was how the drawbar would be positioned for over-the-road operations.
The Pennsylvania DOT supported this proposal in its comments to the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears, however, that adjustable drawbars usually are not fully extended when the vehicle is in motion. Magna
Van and Coca Cola commented that 24 inches is the normal distance between the first and second units of their maxi-cube
vehicles during over-the-road operations, but that longer distances are used for access to driveways and transferring
freight in off-road situations. Other information submitted to the docket indicated that 27 inches is probably the
longest distance between cargo units for highway travel. However, there are times when a longer drawbar setting may
be desirable, such as on rough terrain to keep the cargo boxes from hitting each other; in urban areas while making sharp
turns; or while loading and unloading cargo from the front unit while the rear unit is attached. The maximum reported
unit separation in these instances is 42 inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes Congress intended the maxi-cube length limits to apply to vehicles in their normal operational
configuration. We have concluded that the cargo capacity of these vehicles would be needlessly reduced if the rule
required length measurements to be made with the drawbar at maximum extension, since that position is used only to
assist in low-speed maneuvering or loading and unloading. The last sentence of &sect;658.13(e)(4) has therefore
been modified to read: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the maxi-cube vehicle is equipped with an adjustable drawbar, the 60- and 65-foot distances shall be measured with
a drawbar spacing of not more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that distance to maneuver
or load the vehicle.

The American Movers Conference believes that the load-through feature of the maxi-cube should be made optional.
We do not agree. That language is included both in the statutory definition in 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(f)(2) and in the Appropriations
Committee report. This feature is one of the primary reasons Congress declared maxi-cubes specialized equipment.
Removing the load-through element from the definition would make these vehicles indistinguishable from truck-trailer
combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Connecticut asked if the maxi-cube vehicle will be designated as specialized equipment since it will
be limited to the NN and reasonable access routes. Maxi-cube vehicles are by statute specialized equipment, and Federal
regulations for such equipment apply only on the NN and reasonable access routes.

Beverage Semitrailers

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A rulemaking to designate as specialized equipment the 28-foot van-type, drop-frame beverage semitrailer when
it is equipped with an upper coupler plate that extends in front of the semitrailer, has been underway since 1990. The
last action on the subject was publication of an NPRM on June 25, 1990, at 55 FR 25850. The final rule was being prepared
when the ISTEA was enacted. Since the rulemaking necessary to implement the ``LCV-freeze'' would, like the beverage
semitrailer rule, amend 23 CFR part 658, the decision was made to include both in a single document. Since they amend
the same existing regulation, combining them minimizes the number of separate changes made to an already complex
regulatory document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, established length and width standards for vehicles using the highways designated as the NN (appendix A to 23 CFR
part 658 (1993)). The STAA prohibited any State from enforcing a length limit of less than 28 feet on a semitrailer or
trailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination on the NN (49 U.S.C. app. 2311 (a)). The STAA,
under an equipment grandfather provision, also allows the use of 28.5-foot semitrailers and trailers in truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer
combinations if they were actually and lawfully operating on December 1, 1982, within a 65-foot overall length limit
in any State. The statute prohibited any State from denying reasonable access to points of loading and unloading for
a truck tractor pulling a single 28-foot (28.5-foot if grandfathered) semitrailer that generally operates as part
of a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination. In addition, the STAA gave the Secretary authority to exclude
from measurement of trailer length and width, devices necessary for the safe and efficient operation of CMV's, provided
length exclusive devices did not have, by design or use, the capability to carry cargo (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(h), 2316(b)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions involving permissible vehicle length and length exclusive devices are critical to a new design for 28-foot
beverage semitrailers. As used in this proceeding, ``beverage'' means a liquid for drinking, including water. One
new design places the kingpin under the nose of the trailer with a portion of the upper coupler plate extending beyond
the front of the vehicle. Since these beverage semitrailers use an enclosed van-type, drop-frame design, mounting
the kingpin in this manner allows the drop-frame portion of the semitrailer to be extended forward. The FHWA has issued
several NOI of length and width exclusive devices. The most recent was published on March 13, 1987, at 52 FR 7834. That
NOI recognized a number of length-exclusive design features, including (1) the pickup plate lip of the upper coupler,
and (2) any non-load-carrying device which falls within the swing radius of the semitrailer (measured from the center
line of the kingpin to the front corner of the semitrailer). As applied to the new design described above, these two
provisions have proved difficult to administer and have caused confusion and misunderstanding between the FHWA
and the industry. The June 25, 1990, NPRM proposed to designate as specialized equipment van-type, drop-frame beverage
semitrailers. A 30-day comment period (through July 25, 1990) was provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to seeking general comments, the NPRM requested all interested parties to respond to four questions concerning
these vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA solicited comments on the following questions as well as other comments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in the proposed regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is the proposed length limit for the upper coupler extension of the semitrailer clear?

3. Will the semitrailer, as configured, be as safe as one with the upper coupler plate positioned fully under the semitrailer?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Will the position of the center of the kingpin, not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer, produce offtracking
characteristics that are significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers?

Eight responses to the June 25, 1990, NPRM were submitted to the docket. The respondents included four State Departments
of Transportation; California (Caltrans), Florida (FDOT), Minnesota (MnDOT), and Virginia (VDOT) and the Connecticut
Department of Motor Vehicles, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Hackney and Sons, Inc. (trailer manufacturer),
and one individual. Of these respondents, six favored designating the beverage semitrailer as specified equipment,
one (Caltrans) opposed, and one (VDOT) was not sure the vehicle could operate on its current system of highways for
STAA dimensioned vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Should ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in the proposed regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six respondents commented on defining the ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer.'' Two State DOT's (FDOT
and VDOT) and the Port Authority requested that the terms ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined
in order to administer the regulation without erroneous interpretations. They see this terminology as a potential
enforcement problem. The individual stated that the definition was incomplete as it was now written and should specify
that the trailer has side access only for cargo. The trailer manufacturer requested that it not be defined because
the trailers are also used for palletized cargo as well. Other types of cargo hauled on this type of trailer include
automobile batteries, coin compartments from pay telephones, mushrooms, and nursery plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trailer manufacturer also suggested that the regulation read as follows: ``with the center line of the kingpin
mounted not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer *&blank;*&blank;*.'' It requested the addition of the
words ``the center line of'' because (1) in the semitrailer design under consideration, every inch is important,
(2) this change would provide more swing clearance for the tractor under the gooseneck area of the semitrailer, (3)
the length of the trailer body would not be increased, and (4) it is common in the industry to specify kingpin location
by kingpin center. Based on these comments, the FHWA has modified the definition to state that the semitrailer have
``side access only'' and that the cargo be limited to bottled or canned beverages. The definition has also been revised
to allow the 28-foot length to be measured from the centerline of the kingpin to the rear of the semitrailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is the proposed length limit for the upper coupler extension of the semitrailer clear? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trailer manufacturer and the individual commented that the proposed length limit of the upper coupler was clear
and in a workable location. They did not foresee any possible misinterpretation. The trailer manufacturer responded
that by limiting the upper coupler extension to fall within the swing radius of the front corner of the semitrailer
it is both clear and very workable. This approach has been allowed for the purpose of excluding other front-mounted
items from length measurement and accordingly is to be used for this case as well. The FDOT commented that the proposed
length limit was not clear as described in the June 25, 1990, NPRM. The FDOT also suggests that language is needed to
assure that the coupler plate does not become a cargo carrier in and of itself and that the device stays reasonable in
length. The MnDOT responded that its law currently allows semitrailers of 28.5 feet, in three vehicle combinations,
and the proposed design would only minimally exceed the current standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with these comments, the FHWA concludes that not allowing the upper coupler plate extension to extend
beyond the swing radius of the semitrailer is a clear and sufficient means to restrict the length of this device. The
operational rules have been amended to specify that the upper coupler plate itself cannot be used to carry cargo. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will the semitrailer, as configured, be as safe as one with the upper coupler plate positioned fully under the semitrailer?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Caltrans, MnDOT, trailer manufacturer, and individual agreed that the configuration would be as safe as the upper
coupler positioned fully under the semitrailer. The FDOT commented that the final rule should include requirements
similar to those found in 49 CFR part 393, subpart F_Coupling Devices and Towing Methods. These and other Federal regulations
continue to apply to beverage trailers and need not be cross-referenced in every other applicable regulation. Due
to the specialized nature of the equipment discussed here, however, reference to an applicable provision of 49 CFR
part 393 is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trailer manufacturer responded that the configuration would be safe because the maximum kingpin-to-trailer
axle span will be 25.5 feet. A single 53-foot semitrailer can have a kingpin-to-center of trailer tandem-axle span
of 45.5 feet and still be considered safe. The individual commented that there is no reason to believe that trailers
produced to this configuration would be less safe than trailers with upper couplers fully under the trailer. Dump
trailers and short container chassis often have configurations that place the kingpin forward of the body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VDOT commented that demonstrations should be conducted with each type of semitrailer to determine any difference
between the two mounting plates. A demonstration is not necessary because this style of trailer has been in operation
for several years, and the operating characteristics are known to be compatible to other trailers in current use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments, the FHWA concludes that the semitrailer as configured will be as safe as one with the upper coupler
positioned fully under the semitrailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Will the position of the kingpin, not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer, produce offtracking characteristics
that are significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Port Authority and the manufacturer responded ``no'' to the question. The Port Authority commented that it appears
to them that the offtracking of the beverage semitrailer combinations set forth in the proposed regulation will not
differ significantly from the conventional semitrailer combinations already permitted upon port authority vehicular
crossings. The trailer manufacturer used a ``sum of squares'' method to determine offtracking (Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) J695) and does not find a great increase in offtracking.

The individual commented that offtracking of these specialized trailers will be greater than conventional 28-foot
trailers since the distance from the kingpin to the trailer's axle will increase by up to 3 feet. Also, using the techniques
of SAE J695, he calculated the offtracking for conventional and beverage semitrailers as shown in the following table:

The FDOT responded that the potential of an extra 2 or 3 feet to the kingpin setting may be important with units running
as a tandem combination; however, as a single-unit semitrailer, the difference would be insignificant when considering
the 41-foot kingpin setting that is being discussed as a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 national limit for such settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments, the FHWA concludes that the offtracking characteristics of the beverage semitrailer being
designated as specialized equipment are not significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers.

5. Other comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Caltrans, FDOT, and MnDOT expressed concerns about future petitions for the FHWA to propose a similar rule for
longer beverage semitrailers or semitrailers of a similar design for carrying other goods. The Caltrans' concern
is that the beverage semitrailer is another small step toward allowing larger vehicles by means of an exception process.
For example, since the weight of the beverage semitrailer and load rest on the upper coupler plate extending from the
front of the semitrailer, why not allow the van portion to the semitrailer to be extended over the plate? Also, if a weight
supporting upper coupler plate is permitted for a 28-foot beverage semitrailer, is a 48-foot beverage semitrailer
next? The possibility of a 48-foot beverage semitrailer raises strong concerns about offtracking. A typical semitrailer
has the kingpin located 3 feet from the front of the semitrailer. The Caltrans' evaluation of the State Highway System
for designation of terminal access routes is on the basis of a 48-foot trailer with a 43-foot kingpin-to-center of
the rearmost axle which is equivalent to the 41-foot kingpin-to-center of tandem axles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDOT responded that the proposed rule needs to be modified to assure that other trailers/semitrailers do not grow
in length as a result of this proposed rule. It should be expected that other segments of the industry will seek the same
benefits as are being provided to the beverage haulers under this proposed rule. Similarly, the MnDOT would discourage
the FHWA from further ``piecemeal'' exemptions until a comprehensive review of the commercial vehicle length definition
is conducted. The State finds that this examination is warranted in light of the recent research from the Roads and
Transportation Association of Canada, which demonstrates that the U.S. may in fact be discouraging uniformity and
the use of more stable vehicle configurations on U.S. highways, due to current vehicle definitions. The State supported
the use of the terms ``box length'' and uniform ``kingpin or wheelbase'' for specifying length limits for commercial
vehicle equipment. On the other hand, the MnDOT also commented that the configuration under discussion here would
not have adverse effects on pavements, bridges, or maneuvering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA understands the concerns of these States about its handling of petitions from other segments of the trucking
industry for relief similar to that being provided for beverage semitrailers. The FHWA also recognizes that different
ways to specify trailer length provisions do exist. Future petitions for similar relief provisions will be evaluated
with these concerns in mind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Caltrans commented that the 28-foot beverage semitrailer was not specialized equipment, but rather
another attempt to incrementally increase (by regulatory action) the limits set by the STAA. The FHWA disagrees.
This equipment as defined by this rulemaking is highly specialized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to remove any doubt about using 28-foot beverage semitrailers with an upper coupler plate that extends beyond
the front of the semitrailer on the NN without a special permit, the FHWA is designating them as specialized equipment
pursuant to our authority under section 411(d) of the STAA (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This designation as specialized equipment applies only to van-type, drop-frame, side-loading only, beverage semitrailers
for which the upper coupler plate extends beyond the front of the semitrailer, and the distance from the centerline
of the kingpin connection to the rear of the semitrailer is not greater than 28 feet. The rule preempts States from imposing
an overall length limit on such vehicles operating in semitrailer or double trailer combinations and guarantees
these truck tractor-single beverage semitrailer combinations the same access to points of loading and unloading
as 28-foot (28.5-foot if grandfathered) semitrailers in 23 CFR 658.19. After reviewing the comments to the docket,
the FHWA has concluded that this action would allow for a productivity gain without adversely effecting public safety.
A definition of beverage semitrailer has been added to &sect;658.5, and regulatory language has been added to &sect;658.13.
This action concludes the FHWA rulemaking proceeding that was designated with the regulation identification number
2125&hyph;AC57.

As implemented by 23 CFR 657.13, 23 U.S.C. 141(b) requires each State to certify annually that it is enforcing its size
and weight laws on the Federal-aid Primary System (FAP), Federal-aid Urban System (FAU), Federal-aid Secondary
System (FAS), and the Interstate System in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 127.

Under the new ISTEA provision, States must also certify that they are enforcing and complying with the ISTEA freeze
on the use of LCV's and other multi-unit vehicles. Failure to certify would subject a State to the penalties provided
in 23 U.S.C. 141(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA, however, effectively replaced the FAP with the NHS, and eliminated the FAU and FAS Systems, without providing
a conforming amendment to 23 U.S.C. 141(b). Until 23 U.S.C. 141 is amended to reflect changes in system nomenclature,
the FHWA will require the States to certify size and weight enforcement on those routes which, prior to October 1, 1991,
were designated as part of the FAP, FAS, or FAU Systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Alaska objected to the certification statement proposed in the SNPRM. That statement would require the
State to certify that it is enforcing the freeze provisions of 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and that its State laws are consistent
with 23 U.S.C. 127 (a) and (b). Alaska asserts that section 127 does not apply to the State because the State does not
have any Interstate System mileage as defined in 23 U.S.C. 103, 139(a) or 139(b). The FHWA agrees with this comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same situation with respect to highway system also exists in Puerto Rico, which is considered a ``State'' for the
purposes of title 23, United States Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification language proposed by the SNPRM has been retained, except that language to recognize the situations
in Alaska and Puerto Rico has also been included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language describing size and weight enforcement coverage in urban areas has also been clarified in this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since its initial publication in 1980 (45 FR 52365), &sect;657.15 has required that ``Urban areas not subject to State
jurisdiction shall be identified and the statement shall address total (Federal-aid) mileage involved and an analysis
of enforcement efforts in such areas.'' In practice, the FHWA's interpretation of this requirement over the years
has been to focus on those areas over 50,000 population, also called urbanized areas (as determined by the Bureau of
the Census). The FHWA recognizes an area as ``urban'' when the population is 5,000 or more. It is not now, nor has it ever
been, the intent of the FHWA to require extensive size and weight enforcement activities, or an analysis thereof,
in areas with a population between 5,000 and 50,000. The intent of this requirement has always been to ensure that an
adequate size and weight enforcement effort be conducted by larger cities, i.e., over 50,000 population, where the
State weight enforcement agency does not have legal jurisdiction. Substitution of the word ``urbanized'' for ``urban''
(both terms as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101) in the second sentence of &sect;657.15(b) accomplishes this clarification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What, prior to October 1, 1991, was Federal-aid system mileage in urban areas of less than 50,000 population, should
continue to be covered by the State's overall weight enforcement program. This change in wording does not preclude,
nor should it discourage, weight enforcement activity by local jurisdictions. Such activity is encouraged with
results to be reported as part of the overall enforcement activity in the State.

Conforming Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ISTEA section 4006(c) consisted of a conforming amendment as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 411(e)(1) of such Act (the STAA of 1982) is amended by striking ``those Primary System highways'' and inserting
``those highways of the Federal-aid primary system in existence on June 1, 1991 *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 411(e)(1) of the STAA describes the type of highways that the Secretary shall designate as open to the vehicles
described by the STAA. These designated highways, in combination with the Interstate System, have come to be known
as the NN. The ISTEA effectively replaced what had been known as the FAP System with the NHS. This conforming amendment
corrects the technical problem of designating segments of a highway system (the FAP) which no longer exists. The necessary
corrections to the definitions of ``Federal-aid Primary System'' and ``National Network,'' both found in 23 CFR
658.5, have been made by this final rule.

This final rule implements sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA, which restrict the operation of LCV's on the Interstate
Highway System and CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN to the type of vehicles in use on
or before June 1, 1991, subject to whatever State rules, regulations, or restrictions were in effect on that date.

As noted in the following paragraphs, the FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is: (1) Not a significant regulatory
action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866; (2) not a significant action within the meaning of Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities; (4) does not require the preparation of a federalism assessment; and (5) does not require
the preparation of an environmental impact statement. All of these findings were made and included in the NPRM and
again in the SNPRM, in each case after the FHWA had carefully reviewed the applicable Federal statutes and Executive
Orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA submitted comments to the docket in response to both the NPRM and the SNPRM challenging what it saw as the FHWA's
casual dismissal of determinations required by various statutes and Executive Orders. In comments on the NPRM, the
WTA argued that a long-term effect of any freeze would be to prohibit the natural evolution of technology in the trucking
industry. Such a situation, in turn, would be likely to cause major and significant impacts on competing transportation
modes, related businesses, and the general public. Accordingly, the WTA insisted that the FHWA conduct (1) a full
regulatory evaluation, (2) a full economic assessment, (3) a federalism assessment, and (4) an environmental impact
study.

After undertaking the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA reiterated
in the SNPRM its conclusion that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This conclusion remains unchanged in this final rule. The WTA, responding to an earlier document,
stated that ``there is no question that the form and substance of this NPRM are clearly harmful to small entities. Most
businesses affected in Wyoming are small entities. The few large entities doing business in Wyoming are similarly
adversely affected.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule in no way restricts the ability of small entities to enter the LCV segment of the motor carrier industry. The
LCV segment of the industry can expand as rapidly as it finds customers. Neither the rule nor any State affected by the
rule limits the number of LCV's that may be placed in service, or the number of motor carriers that may operate them.
The rule does not reduce the highway network on which carriers may run LCV's; it simply lists the routes where the States
have decided very large vehicles can operate without seriously damaging pavements and bridges. In Wyoming, that
amounts to every NN route in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA seems to be demanding, not better regulatory analyses, but something like a full-scale econometric model
of the transportation segment of the economy. The WTA apparently believes that such a model, when run, would demonstrate
that the ISTEA freeze is likely to change the competitive balance between railroad and highway transportation, retard
the technological development of trucks, reduce employment in the motor carrier industry, and raise freight costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the LCV freeze includes all State routes currently in use, and because we are not aware that any State wishes
to expand its LCV network, we expect that the freeze will have none of the effects predicted by the WTA, at least in the
short term. The FHWA believes that the ``frozen'' LCV Network offers ample opportunity for reasonable growth. Insufficient
data exist to evaluate the possible longer-term effects of this rulemaking, and any conclusions presented here would
be speculative in nature.

.) (NEPA), the FHWA has twice found that it would have no effect on the quality of the environment. The WTA disagreed:
``A rule which dictates increased use of fuels, a scarce natural resource, affects the quality of the environment
in a negative fashion.'' The rule does not dictate increased use of fuels. If LCV's move freight at a lower fuel or emission
cost per ton/mile than other motor vehicles, as the WTA appears to believe, the rule would not prevent LCV's from displacing
less efficient vehicles. The FHWA sees no reason to change its conclusion.

As discussed earlier, this final rule makes two technical amendments to appendix A, 23 CFR part 658, which lists federally-designated
routes on the NN. These changes would amend the listings for California, to reflect the inclusion of the I&hyph;580
Richmond-San Rafael Bridge in the NN, and also for Virginia, to reflect that State's new milepost-based exit numbering
system. For the reasons set forth earlier in this document, the FHWA has determined that prior notice and opportunity
for comment are not required for either amendment under the U.S. Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies
and Procedures, as it is not anticipated that such action will result in the receipt of useful information.

of a federalism assessment. Although its effect will be to prevent the expansion of the ISTEA vehicle network beyond
that which States allowed on June 1, 1991, that is a direct result of the underlying statute. Moreover, there is no indication
at this time that the States planned any significant expansion of that network which would be impeded by this requirement.

 No State shall impose a length limit on a maxi-cube vehicle, as defined in &sect;658.5 of this part, of less than 34 feet
on either cargo box, excluding drawbar or hitching device; 60 feet on the distance from the front of the first to the
rear of the second cargo box, including the space between the cargo boxes; or 65 feet on the overall length of the combination,
including the space between the cargo boxes. The measurement for compliance with the 60- and 65-foot distance shall
include the actual distance between cargo boxes, measured along the centerline of the drawbar or hitching device.
For maxi-cubes with an adjustable length drawbar or hitching device, the 60- and 65-foot distances shall be measured
with a drawbar spacing of not more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that distance to maneuver
or load the vehicle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) A beverage semitrailer is specialized equipment if it has an upper coupler plate that extends beyond the front
of the semitrailer, but not beyond its swing radius, as measured from the center line of the kingpin to a front corner
of the semitrailer, which cannot be used for carrying cargo other than the structure of the semitrailer, and with the
center line of the kingpin not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer (exclusive of rear-mounted devices
not measured in determining semitrailer length). No State shall impose an overall length limit on such vehicles when
operating in a truck tractor-beverage semitrailer or truck tractor-beverage semitrailer-beverage trailer combination
on the NN.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Truck tractor-beverage semitrailer combinations shall have the same access to points of loading and unloading

(f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000
pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum
of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 pounds per
inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit
steering axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established by the manufacturer, whichever is
lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The weights in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall be inclusive of all tolerances, enforcement
or otherwise, with the exception of a scale allowance factor when using portable scales (wheel-load weighers). The
current accuracy of such scales is generally within 2 or 3 percent of actual weight, but in no case shall an allowance
in excess of 5 percent be applied. Penalty or fine schedules which impose no fine up to a specified threshold, i.e.,
1,000 pounds, will be considered as tolerance provisions not authorized by 23 U.S.C. 127. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) States may issue special permits without regard to the axle, gross, or Federal Bridge Formula requirements for
nondivisible vehicles or loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply to single-, or tandem-axle weights,
or gross weights legally authorized under State law on July 1, 1956. The group of axles requirements established in
this section shall not apply to vehicles legally grandfathered under State groups of axles tables or formulas on January
4, 1975. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section shall not apply to the operation on Interstate Route
68 in Allegany and Garrett Counties, Maryland, of any specialized vehicle equipped with a steering axle and a tridem
axle and used for hauling coal, logs, and pulpwood if such vehicle is of a type of vehicle as was operating in such counties
on U.S. Routes 40 or 48 for such purposes on August 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Beginning October 6, 1992, and ending October 5, 1994, the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section
shall not apply to any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger
bus. The Secretary may extend this temporary exemption for an additional year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. In &sect;658.19, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access to vehicles with dimensions authorized by the STAA
between the NN and terminals and facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest. In addition, no State may enact or enforce
any law denying reasonable access between the NN and points of loading and unloading to household goods carriers,
motor carriers of passengers, and any truck tractor-semitrailer combination in which the semitrailer has a length
not to exceed 28 feet (28.5 feet where allowed pursuant to &sect;658.13(b)(5) of this part) and which generally operates
as part of a vehicle combination described in &sect;&sect;658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a) of this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;658.23 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

LCV freeze; cargo-carrying unit freeze. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and except for tow trucks with vehicles in tow, a State may allow
the operation of LCV's on the Interstate System only as listed in appendix C to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a State may not allow the operation on the NN of any CMV combination
with two or more cargo-carrying units (not including the truck tractor) whose cargo-carrying units exceed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The maximum combination trailer, semitrailer, or other type of length limitation authorized by State law or regulation
of that State on or before June 1, 1991; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The length of the cargo-carrying units of those CMV combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful
operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in that State on or before June
1, 1991, as listed in appendix C to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying
units may operate on the NN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations with a maximum
length of the individual cargo units of 28.5 feet or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Vehicles described in &sect;658.13(e) and (g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Truck tractor-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer combinations with an overall length of 65 feet or less.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Maxi-cubes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Tow trucks with vehicles in tow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For specific safety purposes and road construction, a State may make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency
nature to route designations and vehicle operating restrictions applicable to combinations subject to sections
1023 and 4006 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;240 and in effect on June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991, for Alaska). Adjustments which last
30 days or less may be made without notifying the FHWA. Minor adjustments which exceed 30 days require approval of the
FHWA. When such adjustments are needed, a State must submit to the Division Office of Motor Carriers, by the end of the
30th day, a written description of the emergency, the date on which it began, and the date on which it is expected to conclude.
If the adjustment involves route designations, the State shall describe the new route on which vehicles otherwise
subject to the freeze imposed by sections 1023 and 4006 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;240 are allowed to operate. To the extent
possible, the geometric and pavement design characteristics of the alternate route should be equivalent to those
of the highway section which is temporarily unavailable. Approval or disapproval by Office of Motor Carriers officials
of adjustments involving route designations shall be coordinated with the Division Administrator. If the adjustment
involves vehicle operating restrictions, the State shall list the restrictions that have been removed or modified.
Approval or disapproval of the adjustment by the Division Office of Motor Carriers shall take place only after consultation
with the Regional Office of Motor Carriers. If the adjustment is approved, a copy of the approved submission shall
be forwarded through the Regional Office of Motor Carriers, to the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers at
Headquarters, who will publish the notice of adjustment, with an expiration date, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Requests for extensions of time beyond the originally established conclusion date shall be subject to the same approval
and publication process as the original request. If upon consultation with the Regional Office of Motor Carriers,
a decision is reached that minor adjustments made by a State are not legitimately attributable to road or bridge construction
or safety, the Division Office of Motor Carriers will so inform the State, and the original conditions of the freeze
must be reimposed immediately. Failure to do so may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.

(e) States further restricting or prohibiting the operation of vehicles subject to sections 1023 and 4006 of Public
Law 102&hyph;240 after June 1, 1991, shall notify the FHWA Division Office of Motor Carriers within 30 days after the
restriction is effective. The Division Office of Motor Carriers shall forward the information through the Regional
Office of Motor Carriers to the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers at Headquarters. The FHWA will publish
the restriction in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 as an amendment to appendix C to this part. Failure to provide such notification may subject the State to a penalty pursuant
to 23 U.S.C. 141. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Federal Highway Administrator, on his or her own motion or upon a request by any person (including a State),
shall review the information set forth in appendix C to this part. If the Administrator determines there is cause to
believe that a mistake was made in the accuracy of the information contained in appendix C to this part, the Administrator
shall commence a proceeding to determine whether the information published should be corrected. If the Administrator
determines that there is a mistake in the accuracy of the information contained in appendix C to this part, the Administrator
shall publish in the

This appendix contains the weight and size provisions that were in effect on or before June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991 for
Alaska), for vehicles covered by 23 U.S.C. 127(d) (LCV's) and 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j) (commercial motor vehicles (CMV's)
with 2 or more cargo-carrying units). Weights and dimensions are ``frozen'' at the values shown here, which were in
effect on June 1, 1991 (Alaska, July 6, 1991). All vehicles are listed by configuration type.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the State-by-State descriptions, CMV combinations which can also be LCV's are identified with the letters ``LCV''
following the type of combination vehicle. The maximum allowable gross vehicle weight is given in this appendix (in
thousands of pounds indicated by a ``K''), as well as information summarizing the operational conditions, routes,
and legal citations. The term ``Interstate System'' as used herein refers to the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate
and Defense Highways.

Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Listed for each State by combination type is either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The maximum cargo-carrying length (shown in feet); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A notation that such vehicle is not allowed (indicated by a ``NO''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMV's are categorized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and two trailing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and three trailing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units not included in descriptions 1 or 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the following table the top number is the maximum cargo-carrying length measured in feet from the front of the first
cargo unit to the rear of the last cargo unit. This distance is not to include length exclusive devices which have been
approved by the Secretary or by any State. Devices excluded from length determination shall only include items whose
function is related to the safe and efficient operation of the semitrailer or trailer. No device excluded from length
determination shall be designed or used for carrying cargo. The number below the length measurement is the maximum
gross weight in thousands of pounds that the type of vehicle can carry when operating as an LCV on the Interstate System.
For every State where there is a length or weight number in the table that follows, additional information is provided.

(3)_No maximum cargo-carrying length is established for this combination. Because State law limits each trailing
unit to not more than 28.5 feet in length, this combination is allowed to operate on all NN routes under the authority
of the STAA of 1982, regardless of actual cargo-carrying length. The maximum weight listed is New Mexico's maximum
allowable gross weight on the Interstate System under the grandfather authority of 23 U.S.C. 127.

ACCESS: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A vehicle shall not be operated off the designated portions of the Interstate System except to access food, fuel, repairs,
and rest or to access a facility. Access to a facility shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The facility must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Be either a manufacturing or a distribution center, a warehouse, or truck terminal located in an area where industrial
uses are permitted;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Be a construction site; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Meet the following criteria:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
adequate off-roadway space exists on the premises to safely maneuver the vehicles; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
adequate equipment is available on the premises to handle, load, and unload the vehicle, its trailers, and cargo.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The facility must be located within a maximum distance of 10 miles from the point where the vehicle enters or exits
the designated portions of the Interstate System. Such 10-mile distance shall be measured by the actual route(s)
to be traveled to the facility, rather than by a straight line radius from the designated Interstate System to the facility;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The access route(s) between the designated Interstate System and the facility must be approved in advance by the
public entity (Colorado DOT, municipality, or county) having jurisdiction for the roadway(s) that make up the route(s).
Where the State of Colorado has jurisdiction over the access route(s), it will consider the following safety, engineering,
and other criteria in determining whether to approve the route(s):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Safety of the motoring public;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Geometrics of the street and roadway;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Traffic volumes and patterns;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Protection of State highways, roadways, and structures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Zoning and general characteristics of the route(s) to be encountered; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Other relevant criteria warranted by special circumstances of the proposed route(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local entities, counties, and municipalities having jurisdiction over route(s), should consider similar criteria
in determining whether to approve the proposed ingress and egress route(s); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A permit holder shall access only the facility or location authorized by the permit. If the permit authorizes more
than one facility or location, then on any single trip by an LVC from the designated Interstate System the permit holder
may access only one facility or location before returning to the designated Interstate System.

OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: The operations of triple trailing unit combinations are governed by two sets of criteria:
(1) The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules, and (2) the SVC rules which apply off of the Turnpike except in the case of
vehicles operating under Turnpike access authority. The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules allow a maximum combination
vehicle length of 119 feet overall. The SVC rules require ``Triples'' to have trailers of no more than 28.5 feet maximum
length or a cargo-carrying length of approximately 95 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules have no time-of-day travel restrictions or other special requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SVC rules have several operational conditions. SVC's cannot operate on holidays or during holiday weekends.
SVC's cannot be dispatched or operated during adverse weather conditions. SVC's must travel in the right lane, except
for passing, and the following distance is 100 feet for every 10 miles per hour. SVC permits can include any restrictions
deemed necessary, including specific routes and hours, days, and/or seasons of operation. Rules and regulations
can be promulgated regarding driver qualifications, vehicle equipment, and operational standards.

 The following information pertains to tandem trailer combinations with either trailer more than 28.5 feet long but
not more than 48 feet long. A nine-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 143,000 pounds.
An eight-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 138,400 pounds. The maximum gross
weight that may be carried upon any combination of units is limited by the maximum gross weight that can be carried upon
the axles as follows. For a nine-axle combination: Drive axles_36,000 pounds, axles four/five_36,000 pounds, axles

Dollies. Every converter dolly certified on and after June 1, 1968, used to convert a semitrailer to a full trailer
may have either single or tandem axles at the option of the permittee. Single-axle dollies may not utilize low profile
tires. Combination vehicles with a gross weight in excess of 138,400 pounds must have a tandem-axle dolly to meet the
nine-axle requirement. If the distance between two semitrailers is 10 feet or more, the dolly shall be equipped with
a device or the trailers connected along the sides with suitable material to indicate they are in effect one unit. The
devices or connection shall be approved by the NYSTA prior to use on a tandem trailer combination. The NYSTA tandem-trailer
provisions require that converter dollies shall be coupled with one or more safety chains or cables to the frame or
an extension of the frame of the motor vehicle by which it is towed. Each dolly converter must also be equipped with mud
flaps. Tandem combinations using a sliding fifth wheel attached to the lead trailer, known as a ``B-Train'' combination,
will require a separate Thruway Engineer Service approval prior to the initial tandem run. Special provisions regarding
B-Trains will be reviewed at the time of the application or request for use on the Thruway.

The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement, be over 26 years of age, in good
health, and shall have not less than 5 years of experience driving tractor-trailer or tractor-short double trailer
motor vehicles. Such driving experience shall include experience throughout the four seasons. Drivers must comply
with the applicable current requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, Federal Hazardous Materials
Regulations, and the Economic and Safety regulations of the Ohio Public Utility Commission.

Vehicles being operated under permit at night must be equipped with all lights and reflectors required by the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, except that the trailer shall be equipped
with two red tail lights and two red or amber stop lights mounted with one set on each side. Trailer and semitrailer length
for doubles cannot exceed 48 feet, and mixed trailer length combinations are not allowed for combination vehicles
over 90 feet in length. Combined cargo-carrying length, including the trailer hitch, cannot be less than 80 feet or
more than 102 feet. The number of axles on a double shall be a minimum of five and a maximum of nine. A tractor used in the
operation of a double shall be capable of hauling the maximum weight at a speed of not less than 40 miles per hour on all
portions of the Turnpike.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PERMIT: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A special permit is required if the vehicle is over 102 inches wide, 14 feet high, or 65 feet in length including overhang.
Tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations require a permit if over 75 feet in length, excluding an allowed
3-foot front overhang and a 4-foot rear overhang. For vehicles over 120 inches wide, 14 feet high, or 80 feet long or
if any unit of the combination vehicle is over 60 feet in length, travel is restricted to daylight hours Monday through
noon Saturday, except holidays and the day before and after holidays. Operators are restricted to daylight driving
if the load overhang is more than 4 feet. A ``Long Double Trailer Permit'' issued by the OTC is required for operation
of doubles in excess of 90 feet in length. Towing units and coupling devices shall have sufficient structural strength
to ensure safe operation. Vehicles and coupling devices shall be so designed, constructed, and installed in a double
as to ensure that any towed vehicles when traveling on a level, smooth paved surface will follow in the path of the towing
vehicle without shifting or swerving more than 3 inches to either side of the path of the towing vehicle when the latter
is moving in a straight line. Vehicle coupling devices and brakes shall meet the requirements of the Ohio Public Utilities
Commission and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The distance between the rearmost axle of a semitrailer
and the front axle of the next semitrailer in a coupled double unit shall not exceed 12 feet 6 inches. In no event shall
the distance between the semitrailers coupled in a double exceed 9 feet. Double and triple trailer combinations must
be equipped with adequate, properly maintained spray-suppressant mud flaps on all axles except the steering axle.
In the event that the gross weights of the trailers vary by more than 20 percent, they shall be coupled according to their
gross weights with the heavier trailer forward. A minimum distance of 500 feet shall be maintained between double
units and/or triple units except when overtaking and passing another vehicle. A double shall remain in the right-hand,
outside lane except when passing or when emergency or work-zone conditions exist. When, in the opinion of the OTC,
the weather conditions are such that operation of a double is inadvisable, the OTC will notify the permittee that travel
is prohibited for a certain period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class A and B explosives; Class A poisons; and Class 1, 2, and 3 radioactive material cannot be transported in double
trailer combinations. Other hazardous materials may be transported in one trailer of a double. The hazardous materials
should be placed in the front trailer unless doing so will result in the second trailer weighing more than the first
trailer.

caused by snow, wind, ice, sleet, fog, mist, rain, dust, or smoke. When conditions become sufficiently dangerous
as determined by the company or driver, operations shall be discontinued and shall not resume until the vehicle can
be safely operated. The State may restrict or prohibit operations during periods when, in the State's judgment, traffic,
weather, or other safety conditions make such operations unsafe or inadvisable.

For a combination which includes a truck tractor and two trailing units, the lead trailing unit (semitrailer) may
be up to 40 feet long. The second trailing unit may be up to 35 feet long. However, the primary control is the total cargo-carrying
distance which has a maximum length of 68 feet. Any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety chains
or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must
have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with
no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling
if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.

A permit is required for operation if the gross combination weight exceeds 80,000 pounds. A fee is charged. Permitted
movements must have the lighter trailing unit placed to the rear, and use splash and spray devices when operating in
rainy weather. Movement is not allowed when road surfaces are hazardous due to ice or snow, or when other atmospheric
conditions make travel unsafe.

 For all combinations, the maximum gross weight on two or more consecutive axles is limited by the Federal Bridge Formula
but cannot exceed 129,000 pounds. The weight on single axles or tandem axles spaced 40 inches or less apart may not exceed
20,000 pounds. Tandem axles spaced more than 40 inches but 96 inches or less may not exceed 34,000 pounds. Two consecutive
sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and
last axles of the tandems is 36 feet or more. The weight on the steering axle may not exceed 600 pounds per inch of tire
width. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 81.5 feet the following additional regulations also
apply. The weight on all axles (other than the steering axle) may not exceed 500 pounds per inch of tire width. Lift axles
and belly axles are not considered load-carrying axles and will not count when determining allowable vehicle weight.

 For all combinations, a semitrailer or trailer may neither be longer than nor weigh 3,000 pounds more than the trailer
located immediately in front of it. Towbars longer than 19 feet must be flagged during daylight hours and lighted at
night. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 81.5 feet or less, neither trailer may exceed 45 feet, including
load overhang. Vehicles may be 12 feet wide when hauling baled feed during daylight hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combinations with a cargo-carrying length over 81.5 feet long, neither trailer may exceed 48 feet, including
load overhang. Loading the rear of the trailer heavier than the front is not allowed. All axles except the steering
axle require dual tires. Axles spaced 8 feet or less apart must weigh within 500 pounds of each other. The trailer hitch
offset may not exceed 6 feet. The maximum effective rear trailer overhang may not exceed 35 percent of the trailer's
wheelbase. The power unit must have sufficient power to maintain 40 miles per hour. A ``LONG LOAD'' sign measuring
18 inches high by 7 feet long with black on yellow lettering 10 inches high is required on the rear. Offtracking is limited
to 8.75 feet for a turning radius of 161 feet.

All braking systems must comply with State and Federal requirements. In addition, fast air transmission and release
valves must be provided on all semitrailer and converter-dolly axles. A brake force limiting valve, sometimes called
a ``slippery road'' valve, may be provided on the steering axle. Anti-sail type mud flaps are recommended.

When traveling on a level, smooth paved surface, the trailing units must follow in the path of the towing vehicle without
shifting or swerving more than 3 inches to either side when the towing vehicle is moving in a straight line. Each combination
shall maintain a minimum distance of 500 feet from another commercial vehicle traveling in the same direction on the
same highway. Loads shall be securely fastened to the transporter with material and devices of sufficient strength
to prevent the load from becoming loose, detached, dangerously displaced, or in any manner a hazard to other highway
users. The components of the load shall be reinforced or bound securely in advance of travel to prevent debris from
being blown off the unit and endangering the safety of the traveling public. Any debris from the special permit vehicle
deposited on the highway shall be removed by the permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Permits must be purchased. The Utah DOT Motor Carrier Safety Division will, on submission of an LCV permit request,
assign an investigator to perform an audit on the carrier, which must have an established safety program that is in
compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR parts 387&hyph;399), the Federal Hazardous
Materials Regulations (49 CFR parts 171&hyph;178), and a ``Satisfactory'' safety rating. The request must show
a travel plan for the operation of the vehicles. Permits are subject to Highway Patrol supervision and permitted vehicles
may be subject to temporary delays or removed from the highways when necessary during hazardous road, weather, or
traffic conditions. The permit will be cancelled without refund if violated. Expiration dates cannot be extended
except for reasons beyond the control of the permittee, including adverse weather. Permits are void if defaced, modified,
or obliterated. Lost or destroyed permits cannot be duplicated and are not transferable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is finalizing its interim rule on Use of Force and Application of Restraints, which was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 May 17, 1989 (54 FR 21394). A summary of the public comment and agency response follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau received comment regarding paragraphs (c), (e), (f), (g), and (j) of &sect;552.21, and on &sect;&sect;552.22
and 552.23. With respect to &sect;552.21(c), the commenter stated that there was a lack of specificity as to which
institutional regulations could be enforced by the use of restraints and/or force. The Bureau believes, however,
that the general guidelines and statement of purpose in revised &sect;552.20 (discussed below) and the governing
principles contained in newly designated &sect;552.22 adequately acknowledge the serious nature of conditions
which authorize the use of force and/or restraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(e), the commenter stated that the lifting and carrying of an inmate in restraints could
expose the inmate to both malicious and unintentional physical harm by those prison staff carrying the inmate. The
commenter further stated that such lifting might also expose staff to injury, and stated that no prisoners should
be dragged nor should inmates be enlisted for the purpose of lifting or carrying a restrained inmate because they have
not had appropriate training. The Bureau believes that newly designated &sect;552.22(h) clearly prohibits the
infliction of malicious harm. In addition, appropriate training on the use of force and/or restraints and on the lifting
and carrying of an inmate in restraints is provided to Bureau staff. The Bureau believes that this training is sufficient
to address the commenter's concerns on minimizing the risk of unintentional physical harm to either inmate or staff.
Finally, the Bureau wishes to note that its regulations on the use of force and/or restraints are implemented by staff
and not by inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(f), the commenter objected to the absence of any reference to maximum time length allowed
on the use of restraints. The commenter further noted that medical staff should be consulted when the inmate ``is unable
to regain his or her self-control within a normal time'' and for determining whether continued use of restraints is
necessary. The Bureau believes that adequate provision for medical review and/or continuing care is contained in
newly designated &sect;552.26. As noted below, the Bureau is making further amendment to its provisions for the role
of medical staff in use of force and application of restraints incidents.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(g), the commenter questioned the use of restraints on an inmate in administrative detention
or disciplinary segregation. The Bureau notes that this paragraph (now designated as &sect;552.22(g)) states that,
except when the immediate use of restraints is required for the control of the inmate, application or continued application
of restraints on an inmate in administrative detention or disciplinary segregation requires the approval of Warden
or designee. The Bureau wishes to note that such application would not be routine, and it believes that requiring approval
at this level is sufficient to ensure that such application does accomplish legitimate penological objectives.
As noted below, the Bureau is making further amendments to this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(j), the commenter noted a discrepancy in that this paragraph provided that all significant
incidents involving use of force and application of restraints require documentation, while &sect;522.26 stated
that all incidents involving use of force or restraints be documented. As noted below, newly designated &sect;552.22(j)
is being amended to remove this unintentional discrepancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.22, the commenter objected to exception being made by the Director for use of confrontation
avoidance procedures in specific institutions or housing units. As noted below, this section (now designated as
&sect;552.23) is being revised to remove stated exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.23, the commenter stated that with the exception of preventing inmate self-injury, it
is never necessary to implement four-point restraints. The commenter noted particular objection to paragraph (e),
stating that it allows prison staff to deny the inmate in four-point restraints an opportunity to use the toilet if
he or she continued to resist or became violent while being released. The commenter believed that any self-destructive
behavior exhibited by an inmate in four-point restraint should be reported to medical staff and that control over
the use of four-point restraint by medical personnel is essential. The Bureau believes that this section contains
sufficient safeguards. As noted below, however, this section (now designated as &sect;552.24) is being further
amended for editorial purposes. The Bureau believes that the editorial restatement of the introductory text clarifies
that four-point restraints are to be used when it is determined that they are the only means available to obtain and
maintain control over an inmate. The provisions in paragraph (e) are intended to guarantee that the inmate's access
to toilet facilities are controlled by the inmate's behavior. The Bureau believes that newly designated &sect;&sect;552.24(f)
and 552.26 adequately provide for medical review and responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After due consideration of the comments received, and based upon the experience gained from application of the previously
revised regulations, the Bureau makes the following further amendments. For the sake of clarity, the provisions
in former &sect;552.20 are being revised into two separate sections, and former &sect;&sect;552.21 through 552.26
are redesignated as &sect;&sect;552.22 through 552.27 in order to accommodate the new section. Paragraph codification
and cross references in the revised regulations have been adjusted as necessary. In &sect;552.20, the introductory
text (formerly paragraph (a)) is further amended to include a statement that staff are authorized to use force only
as a last alternative after all other reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. Paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this section (formerly paragraphs (a) (1) and (2)) are amended for editorial purposes. In paragraph (d) (formerly
paragraph (a)(4)) the word ``wounds'' is revised to read ``injury'' to describe more accurately conditions which
may lead to authorized use of restraints by staff. Because an injury may be of such a nature that it would not by strict
definition be considered a wound, the Bureau believes it reasonable to use the broader word ``injury.'' In new &sect;552.21
on types of force, section headings were added to paragraphs (c) and (d) for the sake of editorial consistency. In addition,
paragraph (c) (formerly &sect;552.20(d)) is amended to include reference to soft and ambulatory (leg) restraints.
The use of soft restraints and ambulatory restraints is intended to allow for graduated procedures in applying restraints.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In newly designated &sect;552.22, paragraph (a) is amended to remove an obsolete cross reference, and paragraph
(g) is amended to include reference to graduated procedures in applying restraints. In paragraph (h), introductory
text is amended to include an example of restraint equipment, and paragraph (h)(2) is amended to clarify specific
situations to help avoid physical problems of an inmate under restraints. Paragraph (j) is amended to remove any inconsistency
with the provisions of newly designated &sect;522.27. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.23 is revised to broaden the use of confrontation avoidance procedures. To this effect,
paragraph (b), which contained provisions for exception, is removed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In newly designated &sect;552.24, introductory text is amended to further clarify when four-point restraints may
be used. In paragraph (a), ``vinyl'' is substituted for ``leather.'' Additional editorial amendments to this section
make no change in the intent of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.25 is amended for editorial purposes. There is no change in the intent of the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.26 is revised to specify the role of medical staff in calculated use of force situations.
Paragraph (a) is also amended to include provisions specifically applicable to pregnant inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.27 is reworded, although its intent is unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau believes that the changes to the interim rule discussed above do not impose additional restrictions on
inmates and are necessary in order to provide for the continued protection of inmates, staff, and property. The Bureau
therefore finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring
notice of further proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date for these
additional changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866;
this rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to E.O. 12866. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

3. Section 552.20 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;552.20 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose and scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Prisons authorizes staff to use force only as a last alternative after all other reasonable efforts to
resolve a situation have failed. When authorized, staff must use only that amount of force necessary to gain control
of the inmate, to protect and ensure the safety of inmates, staff, and others, to prevent serious property damage and
to ensure institution security and good order. Staff are authorized to apply physical restraints necessary to gain
control of an inmate who appears to be dangerous because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The inmate assaults another individual; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The inmate destroys government property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The inmate attempts suicide; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The inmate inflicts injury upon self; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The inmate becomes violent or displays signs of imminent violence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule on application of restraints does not restrict the use of restraints in situations requiring precautionary
restraints, particularly in the movement or transfer of inmates (e.g., the use of handcuffs in moving inmates to and
from a cell in detention, escorting an inmate to a Special Housing Unit pending investigation, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A new &sect;552.21 is added to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;552.21 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Types of force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Immediate use of force.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Staff may immediately use force and/or apply restraints when the behavior described in &sect;552.20 constitutes
an immediate, serious threat to the inmate, staff, others, property, or to institution security and good order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculated use of force and/or application of restraints.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This occurs in situations where an inmate is in an area that can be isolated (e.g., a locked cell, a range) and where there
is no immediate, direct threat to the inmate or others. When there is time for the calculated use of force or application
of restraints, staff must first determine if the situation can be resolved without resorting to force (see &sect;552.23).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of Force Team Technique.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If use of force is determined to be necessary, and other means of gaining control of an inmate are deemed inappropriate
or ineffective, then the Use of Force Team Technique shall be used to control the inmate and to apply soft restraints,
to include ambulatory leg restraints. The Use of Force Team Technique ordinarily involves trained staff, clothed
in protective gear, who enter the inmate's area in tandem, each with a coordinated responsibility for helping achieve
immediate control of the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Any exception to this rule is prohibited, except where the facts and circumstances known to the staff member would
warrant a person with correctional experience to reasonably believe other action is necessary (as a last resort)
to prevent serious physical injury, or serious property damage which would immediately endanger the safety of staff,
inmates, or others.

Medical attention in use of force and application of restraints incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In immediate use of force situations, staff shall seek the assistance of mental health or medical staff upon gaining
physical control of the inmate. When possible, staff shall seek such assistance at the onset of the violent behavior.
In calculated use of force situations, guidance of medical staff (based on a review of the inmate's medical record)
will be sought by the use of force team leader to identify physical or mental problems. When mental health or medical
staff determine that an inmate requires continuing care, and particularly when the inmate to be restrained is pregnant,
the deciding staff shall assume responsibility for care of the inmate, to include possible admission to the institution
hospital or, in the case of a pregnant inmate, restraining her in other than a face down four-point position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After any use of force or forcible application of restraints, the inmate shall be examined by a member of the medical
staff, and any injuries noted, immediately treated.

Staff shall appropriately document all incidents involving the use of force, chemical agents, or non-lethal weapons.
Staff shall also document, in writing, the use of restraints on an inmate who becomes violent or displays signs of imminent
violence. A copy of the report shall be placed in the inmate's central file.

. Under this program, certain Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) are required to develop and submit a plan regarding vacancies
in units owned or operated by the PHA. Each plan will be required to include the elements specified in the statute and
this rule. In addition, assessment teams have conducted on-site assessments of the vacancy situations of known eligible
PHAs and may provide assistance to PHAs in developing their plans. The assistance available under this program is
intended to supplement other initiatives of the PHA that will reduce the rate of addressable vacancies in a PHA's inventory.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 21, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule to implement the Vacancy Reduction Program (program). The
program was authorized when section 510 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act added a new section
14(p) to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 14371) (1937 Act). Recently section 14(p) was amended by section
115 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act),
and funding was made available for the first time for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 14(p) requires any public housing agency (PHA) to participate in the program if the PHA has a vacancy rate that
exceeds twice the national average, is designated as troubled under section 6(j) of the 1937 Act, or has been placed
under a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of the 1937 Act. Each PHA participating in the program will be required
to develop a vacancy reduction plan that identifies vacant dwelling units in its inventory and the reasons for the
vacancies, and describes actions to be taken by the PHA for the following five years to eliminate the vacancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the vacancy situations of every participating PHA will be reviewed on-site by assessment teams consisting
of representatives of the Department, independent experts knowledgeable about vacancy problems and management
issues relating to public housing, and PHA officials. The assessment teams will submit recommendations to HUD and
the PHA, and, at the request of the PHA, may assist the PHA in preparing its vacancy reduction plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plans will be the basis for selecting those PHAs that will receive assistance under the program. For troubled PHAs,
funding of vacancy reduction activities will be contingent upon the PHA either making or providing reasonable assurances
of substantial progress in remedying any management deficiencies.

Use of Survey to Determine FY 1993 NOFA Threshold Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the proposed rule, all PHAs where existing data indicated the PHA met the statutory criteria for mandatory
participation in the program were surveyed. The results of the survey have been used to define the threshold factors
for the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and are discussed in greater detail in that NOFA. In addition, the Department has conducted assessments at PHAs that
the Department believes meet the threshold factors for the NOFA that is published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As explained in the NOFA, any PHA that meets the threshold factors and has not already been assessed should immediately
request an assessment by contacting the Department.

and miscellaneous comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The rule states that a PHA must participate in the program if a receiver has been appointed for the PHA. The term ``receiver''
should be clarified, in that HUD has taken actions against PHAs that have resulted in takeovers of programs or operations
from PHAs without necessarily having a court-appointed receiver. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term is statutory and refers to a receiver appointed by a Federal or State court under section 6(j)(3) of the United
States Housing Act of 1937; the term does not include other arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Benefits of the program should be available to a PHA that does not have a vacancy rate of twice the national average
only if the PHA fails the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) standard for vacancies (see 24 CFR
part 901). (PHADA) Similarly, program participation should be optional for troubled authorities that do not have
a vacancy rate twice the national average. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the commenter noted, using the PHMAP standard would require congressional action because the current statute
requires participation by PHAs that are troubled or for which receivers have been appointed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In defining the term ``vacant unit'', reference is made to an effective lease, which is defined in terms of an eligible
family being charged rent. However, because of utility allowances or zero income, many residents do not pay rent for
the units they occupy. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition requires that the family have a right to possession of the unit, in addition to being charged rent. The
calculation of the rent to be charged by a PHA takes into account income and any utility allowance. As noted by the commenter,
as a result of this calculation of rent, the PHA might not actually collect any money from the family having the right
to possess a unit (e.g., when the utility allowance equals or exceeds the total tenant payment). However, the lease
still obligates the tenant and includes a rental charge that, at least in part, is based on income. Therefore, the elements
of the definition are met, even though the actual amount collected by the PHA from the tenant is $0. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A PHA is required to participate in the program if it has a vacancy rate that is twice the national average, regardless
of the number of units in the PHA's inventory. Because the vacancy problems of small PHAs, especially, may be due to
lack of demand, participation in the program should be optional for PHAs with less than 250 units. (PHADA) For the first
year, program participation should be limited to PHAs with 500 or more units. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute does not discriminate among the causes of vacancies in establishing the participation requirements.
However, the extent of participation may be limited to providing documentation of lack of demand or proposals to deprogram
units. In awarding funding, the Department will concentrate on PHAs where there is a demand for housing, as reflected
in the terms of the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Furthermore, because smaller PHAs dependent on CIAP funding often have fewer resources to solve a vacancy problem,
these PHAs could realize substantial improvement of their vacancy statistics with a minimal increment of funding.
Thus, their selection for funding would serve the statutory purposes of the program, and their exclusion from the
initial round of funding could not be justified.

Response: Because current program funding is limited, the Department is concentrating on PHAs that are required
to participate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In the definition of ``vacant unit,'' the proposed rule does not specify a timeframe for determining the existence
of a vacancy. Similarly, in calculating a PHA's vacancy rate for purposes of determining program eligibility, the
proposed rule does not recognize any normal turnover time, such as the 20-day transition period allowed under PHMAP
Indicator 5. (LACHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that the vacancy rate of a PHA is fluid. However, for the purpose of determining eligibility
for the program, the Department has decided to use a snapshot approach, i.e., the number of units vacant at the PHA on
the appropriate date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Development of the Vacancy Reduction Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed rule provides a number of examples of project-specific activities to eliminate vacancies that a
PHA might include in its vacancy reduction plan. The number of examples should be expanded to include such activities
as unit redesign or conversion, site reconfiguration, security improvements, and density reductions. These additional
examples will serve to give a better idea of the range of acceptable activities. (CLPHA, CHA) Similarly, examples
of specific management improvements that should be encouraged include tenant screening, evictions, and marketing
and leasing efforts. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of these examples have been included in &sect;968.407(b)(3)(i) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If demolition or disposition are selected activities, HUD's review and approval process and replacement housing
requirements will make it very difficult for a PHA to provide the required schedule that forecasts when the selected
activities would be accomplished. (CLPHA, PHADA (similar comment for other HUD actions)) In addition, participating
PHAs need to be able to change their schedules for eliminating vacancies to reflect actual funding. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 968.407(b)(3)(ii) and 968.407(b)(8) have been revised to include language providing that, in developing
the required schedule, PHAs should specify action within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 days from HUD approval or other action, when progress is dependent on HUD action. In addition, a schedule may be revised
to reflect the adequacy of funding for proposed activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a PHA needs help in preparing the vacancy reduction plan, the assessment team should be required to assist in
the plan development, if requested by the PHA. The proposed rule does not make this assistance mandatory. (PHADA)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 968.410(d) has been changed to clarify that, if requested by the PHA, HUD will assist a PHA in preparing its
vacancy reduction plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The final rule should clarify that participating PHAs do not have to address each single vacant unit separately,
but should be permitted to group together vacant units by the cause of vacancy. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the statutory requirements, each vacant dwelling unit must be identified. However, vacant units
may be grouped together for purposes of explaining the reasons for the vacancies and proposed actions for eliminating
the vacancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The vacancy reduction plan should include information on turnover problems. (PHADA, AHA) The information should
include the number of units vacated and reoccupied during a defined period and any indication of whether the turnover
rate is changing. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new paragraph has been added to &sect;968.407(b) to require that a vacancy reduction plan include certain information
on a PHA's turnover rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A complete strategy needs to be developed that includes not just rehabilitation work, but tenant screening, eviction,
property management, and security measures, as well. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department and the statute contemplate a complete strategy. A PHA's vacancy reduction plan should include any
action to remove the unit from the PHA's inventory of vacant units, including management improvements in each of the
specific areas mentioned by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If funding will be on a ``first-come, first served'' basis, the sequence of assessment team visits should be by
public drawing in order to avoid charges of favoritism. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the NOFA published today, the Department has decided upon an approach that should provide some funding to all PHAs
that meet the eligibility criteria. Each eligible PHA that is a Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP)
agency will be funded fully for all eligible units and approved activities, because smaller PHAs dependent on CIAP
funding often have fewer resources to solve a vacancy problem. If sufficient funds are available, each PHA that is
a Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) agency will be funded fully; however, if there are not sufficient funds remaining,
each CGP agency will be awarded a pro rata share of the available funding. This pro rata share will be calculated by a
method, to be determined by HUD and announced in the NOFA, that will provide funding equitably to those agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the PHA already is required under PHMAP to have developed a plan to address its vacancy problem, the primary
purpose of the Vacancy Reduction Program assessment team should be a validation or critique of the PHA's existing
plan, rather than an independent assessment. The intent of the program is to encourage action, not further studies.
(PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute requires an on-site assessment of the vacancy situation of each participating PHA, and specifies what
is to be included in the PHA's vacancy reduction plan. To the extent that a PHA is able, the Department encourages the
PHA to use work that has been done in accordance with PHMAP requirements to comply with the requirements of this program.

(3) PHAs that lend a staff person to an assessment team should be reimbursed for the staff person's salary and benefits
during that assignment. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that the statutory provision allowing program funds to be used for travel and administrative
expenses of assessment teams, extends to PHA staff. Therefore, PHAs will be reimbursed for the salary and benefits
for any staff person that serves on an assessment team. However, this does not apply to staff members of the PHA that
is being assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Because the need for these funds is great, the Department should speed up the scheduling of assessments. (MCHA,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Funding of Vacancy Reduction Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HUD needs to clarify its position regarding the use of program funds for security improvements. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where units are vacant because of security problems, HUD will provide funding for physical security improvements,
such as improved locks, security screens, additional lighting, and site improvement. As part of management improvements,
HUD also will provide funding for security activities over a limited duration, if HUD determines that such funding
is likely to result in the reoccupancy and continued occupancy of vacant units. Examples of security activities that
could be funded as part of management improvements include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hiring of additional staff to coordinate the provision, by local government or other public and private entities,
of appropriate social services, such as drug education and treatment referral programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hiring of security guards, through individual employment contracts, or guard services, using competitive
proposal or small purchase procurement procedures, or contracting with a local police force for security that is
in addition to that required under the Cooperation Agreement. As a condition of employment, these security personnel
shall be required to meet all relevant State insurance, training, licensing, and other similar requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development and implementation of improved screening procedures for prospective residents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development of more timely and effective management techniques for dealing with disruptive residents and
drug-related crime; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Organization and training of unarmed voluntary resident patrols to work cooperatively with the local law
enforcement agencies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development and implementation of improved communication and coordination with local law enforcement agencies;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hiring of investigators to investigate drug-related crime in and around the developments or to provide evidence
relating to any such crime in any administrative or judicial proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The minimum housing standards that should be imposed for capital improvements funded under this program are the
modernization standards, not the Housing Quality Standards (HQS). Units renovated to the HQS often still need modernization.
(CLPHA) In addition, the minimum housing standards should be applied only to the inside of units improved under the
program, rather than to common areas and major structural items. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each work item funded under this program must be performed in compliance with modernization standards. However,
the vacancy reduction program is an occupancy program, and HQS is a minimum occupancy standard. The goal of the individual
work items (performed to modernization standards) is to bring the vacant units into an occupiable condition. Section
968.435 of this rule requires certification that affected vacant units will be brought into compliance with the HQS.
As applied in Section I.F(1)(b) of today's NOFA, only aspects of the HQS that pertain to the vacant unit directly are
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The decision on how to target the initial funding available under this program should be based on the survey responses
only and not on any existing data mentioned in the preamble of the proposed rule. (PHADA)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The survey responses were used to determine which PHAs surveyed have vacancy problems and the nature of their problems.
Eligibility and final decisions on funding will be based on submitted applications, including the vacancy reduction
plans, the number of eligible units, and the assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Funding should not be on a ``first-come, first-served'' basis, which rewards those able to act the quickest, but
should be awarded using a more traditional competitive approach. Criteria that should be used to make awards include:
PHA capacity and ability to use the funds effectively and likelihood that additional funds will improve vacancy situation.
Severely distressed properties should not be a priority, and funding should be targeted for entire developments,
rather than scattered units. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the Department would like to fund all PHAs that meet the requirements of the NOFA, it has decided not to include
the first-come, first-served limitation. The immediate goal of the Department is to promote the occupancy of the
greatest number of units; the problems of severely distressed developments are targeted more directly through other
programs and are not priorities of the vacancy reduction program. Similarly, because of funding limitations, the
Department believes the program purposes will be promoted best by targeting the elimination of vacant units, rather
than the upgrading of entire developments that include occupied units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Under some circumstances, a PHA may be made eligible for program funds, but restricted in spending the funds until
an assessment is performed. If this assessment is not done within 45 days of the fund award, then the PHA should be allowed
to expend the funds. (PHADA, CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has already conducted assessments of known eligible PHAs and will complete all assessments in advance
of funding decisions. In order to ensure fairness, in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Department has provided that a PHA for which an assessment has not been conducted but that considers itself eligible
under the NOFA, should notify the Department within 15 days of its request for an immediate assessment. In addition,
when an approvable plan submitted in response to the NOFA needs improvement or supplementation, the Department will
assist the PHA in revising its plan prior to the execution of the amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).
Because very few, if any, eligible PHAs will not have had assessments by today's publication of the NOFA, the Department
believes that all assessments will be completed on a timely basis in this funding cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Activities that will decrease unit turnover in occupied units (e.g., replacement of appliances) also should
be considered eligible for funding under this program. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the Department recognizes the relationship between turnover and vacancy rates and is sympathetic to this
reasonable suggestion, current funding for the vacancy reduction program is limited. Therefore, the Department
intends to target funding of unit improvements for currently vacant units or units to become vacant for reconfiguration
purposes, where reconfiguration is necessary to reduce the current number of vacancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Funding should be guaranteed for a minimum of a three-year period following HUD approval of a five-year vacancy
reduction plan, subject to the PHA's continued progress on and adherence to its vacancy reduction plan. (CHA, MCHA)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department cannot guarantee funds that have not been appropriated by Congress. Therefore, a PHA's five-year
plan should reflect a realistic projection of the actions that can be taken with available or potential resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If funded activities require compliance with Housing Quality Standards, the amount of funds may not be sufficient
to address problems in areas outside the unit (e.g., hallways, stairways, fire protection systems). HQS standards
should apply only to unit interiors. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department recognizes that current funding available under the Vacancy Reduction Program will not be sufficient
to address all problems areas relating to excess vacancies, and it expects to be guided in its funding decisions by
the assessment team reports. The vacancy reduction plans and the recommendations of the assessment teams should
include all work inside the units, in the hallways, in common areas, on the site, and to the exterior of the buildings
necessary to make the units marketable; providing plans and funding for only the interiors of vacant units may not
make those units marketable. Individual work items funded under this program must comply with modernization standards
and must result in the targeted unit meeting the HQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Program funds should not be directed at PHAs that have vacancy problems due primarily to marketing problems or
lack of demand. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that the limited program funds should be focused on those PHAs whose vacancy situations can
actually be improved by additional funding. This factor is accounted for in &sect;968.413(d)(2) of the rule (``extent
to which the proposed activities will improve the PHA's vacancy problem'') and in the definition of ``eligible unit''
set out in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's

Sanctions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Department reported that, at this time, it does not intend to implement section 14(p)(3)
of the statute, which provides sanctions for the failure to make progress under a plan. However, commenters were invited
to submit suggestions on how this portion of the statute could be implemented in the future. Several commenters submitted
remarks on this aspect of the current statutory program, as follows: (1) If a withholding action seems likely after
18 months, an assessment team should be sent to the PHA to perform a review and prepare a report. (PHADA) (2) If there
is withholding, consideration should be given to forcing a receiver to be used so that the funds can be used. (PHADA,
CHA) (3) Withholding of subsidy because of a failure to make progress is contrary to the approach of rewarding PHAs
for solving problems. (MCHA)

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule does not include provisions implementing the sanctions mandated by section 14(p)(3) of the 1937 Act.
However, the Department is continuing to work on those provisions, and will take into consideration the remarks provided
by commenters in response to the proposed rule. The Department will comply with the requirements within the applicable

Use of NOFAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HUD is proposing to use NOFAs as the vehicle to convey significant program information to interested PHAs, which
defeats the intent of notice-and-comment rulemaking. The proposed rule does not provide sufficient detail on how
program funds will be targeted, the format of the vacancy reduction plans, and criteria for determining a PHA's capacity
to implement the plan in a timely and effective manner. Use of NOFAs will lead PHAs to try to second-guess HUD on selection
criteria and lead to a hit or miss approach on solving the vacancy problem. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees with this comment. The rule provides the framework for the program and meets or exceeds the
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Department's regulations. The preamble to the proposed
rule elaborates on the Department's expectations for targeting funds made available for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department views the program as a dynamic tool in the effort to reduce unnecessary vacancies in public housing.
Experience with the program and elimination of certain root causes of vacancies will guide the Department in selecting
the optimal criteria for any subsequent targeting of program funds. This targeting would be done in compliance with
the statutory parameters of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to undertake the vacancy reduction effort by providing funding for those vacant units most
likely to be turned around quickly, targeting the majority of the funding for units averaging a cost of $8,000 or less,
with some funds targeted for units for which a CGP agency can provide the additional funding necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the report of the assessment team is expected to address the capacity of a PHA to implement vacancy reduction
activities in a timely and efficient manner. The Department reiterates that the intent of the requirement that participating
PHAs submit vacancy reduction plans is to assist in the development of a comprehensive approach to vacancy reduction.
As demonstrated by its efforts to solicit the input of industry and PHA representatives during the development of
the proposed rule and the initial NOFA, the Department is committed to implementing this program in a constructive
way that responds to the needs of PHAs with remediable vacancy problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before the NOFA is published, there should be a meeting with industry groups. The meeting should be used to share
survey results and exchange viewpoints. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department solicited the input of representatives of the industry, PHAs, and resident organizations during
the development of the proposed rule and the initial NOFA. Meetings were held with these representatives on January
28 and July 9, 1993. The Department believes these meetings have been valuable in helping to develop the program, but
does not believe that it is necessary to schedule any additional meetings at this time. The discussions at the previous
meetings, along with the written comments received in response to the proposed rule, have provided the Department
with a foundation for the policy decisions it has made regarding how to operate this program within the parameters
established by Congress. Furthermore, in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Department discusses the results of the survey, in the context of both general results and specific implications
for the program decisionmaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed rule seems to imply that more than one NOFA might be published in a single fiscal year. Only one NOFA
should be issued and it should coincide with the Comprehensive Grant Program planning process. (PHADA, CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The language that referred to ``periodic'' NOFAs in the proposed rule was intended simply to verify that separate
NOFAs would be published for any money that is appropriated for the program in subsequent years. This is the common
practice of the Department, as established in the HUD Reform Act, but the actual timing of a subsequent NOFA in any fiscal
year cannot be predicted. The Department appreciates the commenters' point about the coordination of capital planning
programs.

Relationship of the Vacancy Reduction Program to Other HUD Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HUD should integrate the approach of the Vacancy Reduction Program into an overall effort to draft a new vacancy
rule. The Vacancy Reduction Program itself is insufficient to address problems faced by PHAs with expired Comprehensive
Occupancy Plans (COPs); these PHAs still need operating funds to keep vacant units in shape until money is available
to make necessary improvements. (CLPHA)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any new vacancy rule would require substantial time for development and implementation. Meanwhile, the Department
is committed to providing assistance currently available under the vacancy reduction program to PHAs with vacancy
problems. Changes to the determination of operating subsidy eligibility as proposed by the commentor are outside
the scope of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Vacancy Reduction Program may duplicate planning requirements of other programs, such as PHMAP and the Comprehensive
Grant Program, that also address vacancy problems. (PHADA, CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, the Department appreciates the commenters' point about the coordination of capital planning programs
and will endeavor to integrate the vacancy reduction program with other related programs.

(3) The same format used for the vacancy reduction plan should be used for developing an Improvement Plan under PHMAP
if the PHA fails the PHMAP vacancy standard. (PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to coordinate the formats of these plans, to the extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The restrictions placed on assistance to troubled authorities (see &sect;968.413(b)) should be made consistent
with the language of HOPE VI. (PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The restrictions are prescribed by the authorizing statute for the program. However, in recognition of the comments
requesting coordination of the Department's capital planning programs, the final rule includes new language that
cross-references PHMAP indicators and clarifies the evaluation of the progress of troubled PHAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If a PHA presents a vacancy reduction plan that HUD approves, the PHA should receive operating subsidy based on
its actual occupancy rate, rather than on the current formula rate. (CHA, AHA) How does the Department view this program
in the context of the Performance Funding System (PFS) funding of vacant units? (PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vacancy reduction program is not intended as a substitute for the vacancy rule or to provide relief for PHAs that
do not meet established goals under COPs. However, the vacancy reduction program should improve the revenue situations
of participating PHAs in two ways: First, through direct funding of portions of the plans; second, through the increased
operating subsidies and rent collections that will result from reoccupancy of those vacant units.

Miscellaneous
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The survey results and data developed from analyzing the vacancy reduction plans should be released publicly.
(PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

The Department is releasing data from the survey as part of the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, the Department intends to develop a report based on data and information provided by the assessment
teams in their reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Vacancy Reduction Program should be separately funded, instead of using amounts set aside from regular modernization
funding. (PHADA, CHA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As recognized by the commenters, Congress has authority over the mechanism used for funding the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Funding decisions under the program should recognize when a PHA has used existing resources to address its vacancy
problem. For example, although a commitment to use a large portion of CGP funds to address vacancies will reduce the
need for additional vacancy reduction funds, those CGP funds could have been used to fund other substantial needs
of the PHA. (AHA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When PHAs have other modernization needs that cannot be met by current funding, Vacancy Reduction Program funds may
be used instead of CGP funding committed but not yet under contract for vacancy reduction.

Section-by-Section Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is establishing the Vacancy Reduction Program as new subpart D in 24 CFR part 968, with conforming amendments
made as necessary in other sections of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The following discussion is a section-by-section
description of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 968.103 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
addresses the allocation of funds under section 14 of the 1937 Act. The Department is amending paragraph (c) to account
for the new set-aside for the Vacancy Reduction Program. The new language repeats the statutory scheme for setting
aside four percent of the section 14 funds remaining after deducting amounts for emergencies and natural and other
disasters. Paragraph (c)(1) provides that 20 percent of these funds will be available for activities under section
6(j) of the 1937 Act, while the remaining 80 percent will be available for the Vacancy Reduction Program, as implemented
by this rule. Section 968.103 also is amended to clarify that the Vacancy Reduction Program does not apply to Indian
Housing Authorities (IHAs).

Section 968.407 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
establishes the requirement that eligible PHAs submit a five-year vacancy reduction plan, and specifies the contents
of the plan. For purposes of identifying components of a plan that may be identified as eligible for funding, within
the limits of appropriated amounts, each submitted plan must be organized in a manner that facilitates review by the
Department. For each action proposed to eliminate vacancies, the plan must include a schedule that shows the number
of vacancies that the PHA expects to eliminate by the end of each 12-month period during the five years of the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When components of a plan involve capital improvements to dwelling units, the PHA must ensure that, after the improvements,
the units themselves would meet or exceed the Housing Quality Standards set forth in 24 CFR 882.109, as amended by regulatory
requirements concerning lead-based paint hazards.

establishes eligible uses and limitations on the use of funds available for the Vacancy Reduction Program. Paragraphs
(a), (b), and (c) echo the statute establishing the program, but paragraph (b) includes clarifying language that
cross-references PHMAP indicators in measuring the progress required under the statute for troubled PHAs. Paragraph
(d) establishes that funding decisions would be through a publicly announced process, on the basis of priorities

 The Vacancy Reduction Program in subpart D of this part does not apply to IHAs. In addition, because the PHMAP performance
indicators under 24 CFR part 901 do not apply to IHAs, these agencies cannot be deemed ``mod troubled'' for purposes
of the CGP and are not eligible for funding under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Hence, IHAs are not subject to
any reduction in funding under section 14(k)(5)(A) of the Act, and IHAs do not participate in the set-aside credits
established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule implements section 10(a) of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act of 1975. The Act directs
the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate rules and regulations deemed necessary to guide the use and development
of private lands within the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. This rule establishes the baseline standards
of private land use and development that are compatible with the purposes of the Act and that, if not met, could result
in the Secretary's use of the private land acquisition authority provided by the Act. The intended effect is to ensure
that the values of the HCNRA will be protected and preserved, and as envisioned by the Act, that traditional ranching,
grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and other uses can be perpetuated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (HCNRA) by the Act of December 31, 1975 (the Act) in
order to assure that the natural beauty, and historical and archaeological values of the Hells Canyon area are preserved
for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecologic values and public enjoyment of the area are
thereby enhanced. Public Law 94&hyph;199, 89 Stat. 1117 at Sec. 1 (codified at 16 U.S.C. 460gg et seq.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10 of the Act directs the Secretary to promulgate such rules and regulations as are deemed necessary to accomplish
the purposes of the Act, including standards for the use and development of privately owned property within the HCNRA.
Section 10 further provides that the Secretary may use the land acquisition authority in section 9 of the Act to implement
the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to section 10. As for the Snake, Rapid, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers,
the governing authority for land acquisition is found in section 6 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Both section 9
of the Act and section 6 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act restrict the Secretary's condemnation authority; i.e. acquiring
land without the consent of the landowner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 14, 1993, the Forest Service published a proposed rule that would establish the standards for the use and
development of private lands in the HCNRA (56 FR 65300). The purpose of the proposed regulations was to make clear those
circumstances which would trigger possible use of the Secretary's condemnation authority. The proposed rule established
categories of private land and standards for the use and development of private land within a given category. Compliance
with the standards would generally be deemed consistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Violation
of the standards would generally be deemed inconsistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, and,
thus the lands could become the subject of federal acquisition. Thus, the proposed rule sought to make clear to affected
landowners those uses that could continue or be undertaken without risk of federal acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout its efforts to devise regulations applicable to private lands within the HCNRA, the Forest Service has
sought to avoid direct regulation of private lands and their uses. Instead, the agency has sought to define those uses
of private lands that are consistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, to encourage retention
of traditional and valid private land uses as established by the Act, and, thereby, to avoid having to exercise the
condemnation authority granted the Secretary by the Act. Under the proposed rule, the Forest Service would not seek
to regulate per se or enjoin proposed uses or developments on private land. Rather, the agency chose to set forth in
the proposed rule standards for private land use and development, which establish the basis for using the secretary's
land acquisition authority in the HCNRA. The proposed rule also established a mechanism by which a landowner could
petition for a change in land category assignment and a mechanism by which a landowner could determine whether an existing
or proposed land use or development was in compliance with the standards of the rule. The Forest Service may also initiate
a noncompliance determination on its own without having first received a landowner request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the Secretary would not acquire the subject land or interests therein unless it was with the
consent of the landowner in those cases where a landowner was in compliance with the applicable standards. If, however,
the landowner was not in compliance, the Secretary could acquire a fee simple or lesser interest in the subject land
without the landowner's consent. The proposed rule also provided landowners and other interested parties an opportunity
to appeal a compliance or noncompliance determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight letters expressing a variety of viewpoints were received during the 60-day comment period on the proposed rule.
These letters contained the views of a power company, a powerboat association, a preservation group, a local county
government, another agency of the federal government, an ad hoc citizens river committee, a state agricultural organization,
and a local chapter of the same organization. The comments contained in these letters have been carefully considered
in the adoption of this final rule. The Department appreciates the time and energy the reviewers invested in preparing
these letters and articulating their concerns on the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule dealt both with general issues, such as the scope and extent of the Secretary's authority
under this rule, as well as discrete issues relating to specific provisions enumerated in the proposed rule. In addition,
there were several comments urging that language in the Supplementary Information section of the proposed rule be
corrected and/or clarified. A summary of the comments and the Department's response follows.

1. Scope and Extent of the Secretary's Authority Under This Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two reviewers raised a number of concerns regarding the use of the Secretary's land acquisition authority to effectuate
the standards set out in the rule for private land use and development. The comments reflected the divergent views
of the reviewers and, to some degree, a misunderstanding of the system as envisioned in the proposed rule. The comments
received on this issue and the Department's response follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: The Secretary is impermissibly engaged in the zoning of private lands in the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One reviewer suggested that the process set forth in the proposed rule which establishes land use categories and allowable
uses within those categories is ``zoning.'' Further, this same reviewer noted that the acquisition of lands without
the landowner's consent is ``zoning.'' Finally, this reviewer noted that using condemnation to ensure compliance
is an extreme measure and that the Forest Service should attempt to ``work in harmony'' with the private landowners
in the HCNRA to ensure compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule does not vest the Secretary with zoning authority. Zoning is defined as the division of a community
into areas in each of which only certain designated uses of land are permitted, so that a community may develop in an
orderly manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the end result may be the same in terms of protecting an area against potentially incompatible land uses, there
is an important distinction between the exercise of a local government's zoning authority and the federal government's
eminent domain authority. Zoning laws are rooted in the exercise of a state's police power (usually delegated to a
subdivision of the state) to prevent persons under its jurisdiction from using their property to the detriment of
the general welfare. The power of eminent domain, on the other hand, is the power to acquire, or to authorize the acquisition
of, private property for a public use or purpose without the owner's consent, conditioned upon the payment of just
compensation. Because, zoning laws ordinarily do not constitute a taking of property for public use for which compensation
must be paid, they differ substantially from the government's right to determine the use of real estate under the power
of eminent domain, which requires just compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency went to great length to explain that the mechanism by which the Secretary
would protect the HCNRA from incompatible private land use and development was through acquisition (condemnation)
rather than regulation (injunction). In the conclusion to the preamble of the proposed rule [58 FR 65304, Col. 2],
the agency expressly stated that: ``The proposed regulations have been carefully drafted to avoid any conflict with
local zoning authority and any appearance that the Forest Service desires to regulate private land uses.'' Relying
on acquisition authority to enforce zoning ordinances is entirely consistent with sections 9 and 10 of the Act. Moreover,
this approach is the least intrusive to the private landowners in the HCNRA, and it will not duplicate the role nor supplant
the authority of the local governmental units in the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department agrees with the reviewer's observation that condemnation is an extreme measure to enforce
compliance with the standards set out in this rule. As was stated in the conclusion to the preamble to the proposed rule
[59 FR 65304, Col. 2], ``The agency views the use of condemnation authority as a last resort to protect the HCNRA,''
to be instituted only where other, more harmonious measures and attempts to cooperate with the landowners do not succeed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: The Secretary should more actively regulate private lands in the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ironically, while one reviewer asserted that the Forest Service had virtually usurped local zoning authority over
the private lands in the HCNRA, another reviewer stated that the Forest Service was obligated to assert a more vigorous
regulatory role over these same lands. In particular, this reviewer asserted that relying on the condemnation authority
delegated to the Secretary in section 9 of the Act will not adequately protect the HCNRA and that the Forest Service
must exercise its ``inherent regulatory authority'' over private lands that are adjacent to federal lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to properly respond to this comment, the following two questions must be addressed_(1) Does the Secretary
have an ``inherent regulatory authority'' vis-a-vis private lands in the HCNRA? and (2) If so, is its exercise necessary
to comply with the HCNRA Act?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not dispute the proposition that, pursuant to the Property Clause of the Constitution, Congress
has delegated to it the authority to regulate and administer National Forest System lands under the Organic Act; the
Multiple-Use, Sustained-Yield Act; the National Forest Management Act; the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources
Planning Act; the Wilderness Act; the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and the HCNRA Act, to name just a few. In furtherance
of those enactments, regulations throughout title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations vest broad authority in the
Forest Service to manage National Forest System lands and many of the activities that occur thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, these authorities are confined to National Forest System lands and do not apply to private lands. The options
regarding regulation on private lands are considerably more limited. To begin with, the Forest Service cannot ``zone''
private lands as that term is commonly understood. ``Zoning'' is an authority that is reserved to the States and their
subdivisions under the Constitution. Congress examined this issue prior to the establishment of the Cape Cod National
Seashore many years ago. Their analysis then is instructive today.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Government does not have authority to directly enact zoning laws applicable to private property in any
of the States. If it had such authority, the task of preserving an area such as lower Cape Cod in such a way as to safeguard
the interests of private landowners might be somewhat simplified, for Congress could simply enact a zoning law for
the area. However, in the division of powers between the States and the Federal Government, it is wisely left to States
to adopt zoning laws *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, [the Act] requires the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations as soon as possible after the
enactment of the bill setting forth the standards which must be met by town zoning bylaws for purposes of suspending
his power of eminent domain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only regulatory authority that the Forest Service possesses relative to private lands is its authority as a landowner
to enjoin activities on adjacent or nearby lands which threaten the National Forest land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the considered judgment of the Department that the acquisition of lands or interests therein, in conjunction
with locally established zoning measures, remains the most efficient and viable system to legally control potentially
incompatible land use and development in the HCNRA. This is the thrust of this rule. Its success depends on the best
efforts of the Forest Service, State and local governments, and landowners in the HCNRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, this rule should not be construed to foreclose the Agency's right to enjoin certain activities which threaten
to compromise the values for which the HCNRA was established. Whether such action is warranted would need to be decided
on a case-by-case basis. In the event that a nuisance-like activity should arise in the future which threatens the
HCNRA, the Forest Service would be fully authorized to exercise its prerogative as a landowner to seek to get the activity
terminated or modified so as to eliminate the deleterious effects on National Forest System lands.

Comment: Snake River water rights. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer suggested that the rule should address withdrawals and diversions of water from the Snake River that
are used for irrigating traditional farming and ranching activities in and around the HCNRA. This reviewer urged
that the rule prescribe: how much water can be diverted, the time and purpose of diversion, and whether the diversion
should be phased out so water may be retained in the Snake River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of water from the Snake River is an integral component of many of the traditional farming and ranching operations
occurring in the HCNRA. While the reviewer's concern may be legitimate and this rule would present an appropriate
vehicle to address these concerns, Section 6 of the Act expressly prohibits the incorporation of these suggestions
into this rule as follows: No provision of this Act, nor any regulations issued hereunder, shall in any way limit, restrict,
or conflict with present and future uses of the waters of the Snake River and its tributaries upstream from the boundaries
of the [HCNRA] created hereby, for beneficial uses, whether consumptive or nonconsumptive, now or hereafter existing,
including, but not limited to, domestic, municipal, stockwater, irrigation, mining, power, or industrial uses.

Comments: Access to private land. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer stated that access is an integral part of the traditional uses recognized under the HCNRA Act and should
not be arbitrarily limited since such limitations would reduce property value and restrict traditional uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the reviewer did not make clear how the proposed rule would limit access to private lands, nor did the reviewer
offer suggestions for addressing the access issue, the Department notes that the proposed rule was silent on the issue
of access and nowhere can it be inferred that the rule would permit the Forest Service to arbitrarily limit such access.
The Department does not believe that this rule needs to address access, since section 1323 of the Alaska National Interest
Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) requires that access be granted to nonfederally owned lands located within the National
Forest System. Agency rules at 36 CFR part 254, subpart E implement section 1323 and already apply to private lands
within the HCNRA which are subject to the terms and conditions for reasonable ingress and egress that may be imposed
by the Forest Service.

Comment: Monitoring. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer noted that the proposed rule failed to establish a system whereby the use and development of private land
in the HCNRA could be monitored by the Forest Service to detect violations. According to this reviewer, the rule is
``grossly deficient, and contrary to law in this respect.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While there was no provision for monitoring in the proposed rule, this rule is not somehow legally insufficient as
a result. Monitoring by the Forest Service can occur in a number of ways and need not be expressly provided for or authorized
in this rule. For instance, monitoring can occur by reviewing the actions of the local government regarding private
land use and development issues. The Forest Service also can and does monitor private land use and development through
routine aerial photographs for fire prevention and control, forest pest management, and landscape planning and
management and on-the-ground observations from adjacent National Forest land. Additionally, where the Forest
Service receives permission from the landowner, monitoring could also be accomplished via an on-site investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, monitoring also would be accomplished through the compliance determination process which
is optional on the part of the landowner. Although the Department believes that monitoring was never eliminated from
the Forest Service's responsibilities by the proposed rule, it also believes that monitoring is so important that
it would like to make clear that the Forest Service may monitor the uses and developments on private lands at any time
it believes it has good reason to be concerned about the protection of the values for which the HCNRA was established.
To emphasize this point, the final rule adds a new standard in &sect;292.24, paragraph (b)(2) which states that the
Forest Service may initiate the compliance process on its own without having first received a landowner request.
This standard clearly shows that the Forest Service may initiate the determination of compliance process, where
the agency has reason to believe, based on monitoring or other information, that the landowner may be violating the
standards for private land use and development established by this rule.

Comment: ``Farm/forest/grazing lands.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two reviewers suggested that the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing lands'' be modified to eliminate references
to watershed protection, fish &amp; wildlife habitat maintenance and recreational activities as purposes for which
farm/forest/grazing lands may be used. These reviewers felt that these additional non-farming uses could pose burdensome
and expensive requirements on the management of farming or grazing operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reviewers' concern that this definition would result in the imposition of additional requirements on their operations
is unfounded. The subject definition is set out in the disjunctive. In other words, farm/forest/grazing lands may
be used for farm/forest/grazing purposes or for watershed purposes, or for fish &amp; wildlife purposes, or for recreational
purposes, or for a combination of the above. The inclusion of these terms in this definition does not imply that new
requirements would be incorporated into ongoing farming and ranching operations in the HCNRA. Of course, these farming
and ranching operations are still subject to applicable federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. Therefore,
the definition is adopted without change from the proposed rule. However, on consideration of the comments on the
term ``farm/forest/grazing lands,'' the Department has determined that the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing
uses'' should be modified so that it more closely parallels the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing lands.'' To
that end, a new second sentence has been included in the ``farm/forest/grazing use'' definition which recognizes
that uses related to watershed protection, fish and wildlife habitat maintenance, and recreational activities
may also be undertaken on these lands. Again, because these activities may be undertaken does not signify that they
must be undertaken. The definition of ``farm/forest/grazing use'' also has been rearranged for ease of reading and
comprehension.

Comment: ``Land modification.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer noted that the definition of ``land modification'' in the proposed rule included road construction
as an example but that the circumstances under which road construction would be accommodated in conjunction with
access needs for the purpose of maintaining and constructing utility facilities were unclear.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that the potential applicability of the definition of ``land modification'' to utility maintenance
activities is unclear. Indeed, while ``land modification'' was included in &sect;292.21 of the proposed rule, it
was not used elsewhere; therefore, it has been deleted from the final rule. Absent this term, the Department construes
the standard at &sect;292.23(a)(4) of the final rule as accommodating reasonable road access to utility facilities
provided that such access is associated with the routine and necessary maintenance of these facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, further review of the definition section disclosed that the terms, ``Comprehensive management plan,''
``seasonal feedlots,'' and ``zoning'', were not used in the proposed rule; accordingly, those terms have not been
retained in the final rule. All other terms and their definitions are retained without change in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule established four categories to which private lands in the HCNRA would be assigned and would require
that maps showing private lands and the categories to which they have been assigned be on file and available for public

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer complained that the map identifying the private lands in the HCNRA and the land use category to which they
had been assigned was not available for review during the comment period on the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department regrets that the map was unavailable, since this could have been of some assistance to the parties in
the preparation of their comments on the rule. The Department has modified this section in the final rule to require
the map (or maps) to be prepared and available for review not later than 60 days after the effective date of this regulation
and also to require the Ranger to give notice of the availability of the maps in the local newspapers of record. If any
parties are concerned about a specific land category assignment, they can make their concerns known to the Forest
Service at that time, and the Forest Service will consider these concerns prior to the adoption of a final map. No other
changes were made to this section.

Section 292.23&blank;Standards of Compatible Land Use and Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would establish standards of private land use and development that reflect traditional and valid
uses of private lands in existence as of December 31, 1975 for four categories of land use. These categories were farm/forest/grazing,
mining, residential, and commercial land. The standards for these land categories were intended to guide the Ranger
in determining whether uses of a private parcel are compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established.
Some standards applied to all categories of private lands, while others were specific only to a particular land category.
Standards were prescribed to allow conformity of private land uses and developments with the laws of various jurisdictions.
Among other things, the proposed rule set standards for the screening and blending of new and replacement structures,
banned solid waste and hazardous substance disposal sites, required utility lines to be buried, disallowed new or
replacement structures in wilderness, and provided for the protection of historic and archaeological sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: Expense of underground utility installation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer noted that the standard in &sect;292.23(a)(4) regarding the placement of new or replacement of existing
utility lines underground could be prohibitively expensive and environmentally damaging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this standard clearly establishes a preference for underground utility installation wherever feasible,
the Department is well aware of the rugged and varied terrain in the HCNRA and the difficulty, if not impossibility,
of installing utility lines underground in certain areas. It is for that reason that the standard in the proposed rule
regarding underground utility installation included the caveat ``where ground conditions and topography permit.''
Therefore, a change in the final rule was necessary. It is recognized that, by necessity, the evaluation of the location
of utility lines must be made on a case-by-case basis.

Comment: Wilderness structures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer opposed the standard in &sect;292.23(a)(5) which provided that no new structures could be developed
on private lands within the boundaries of the Hells Canyon Wilderness in the HCNRA. This reviewer stated that this
standard oversteps the professed bounds of the law. This reviewer further contended that such a restriction should
apply only if the structure would be visible from the wilderness, since otherwise there would be no negative effect
on anyone's wilderness experience. The reviewer also stated that nothing in the Wilderness Act permitted wilderness
visitors to trespass on private lands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of the rule is, where deemed necessary, to apply the same standards for private land uses and developments
to lands within the designated wilderness boundaries, as would be applied outside of wilderness. Under the proposed
rule, those lots within wilderness would be classified as farm/forest/grazing lands. Most of the private land parcels
within wilderness are less than 160 acres, and so, even without the wilderness lands restriction, the proposed rule
would not consider the development of any new residences appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the proposed rule, the Department determined that the protection of the wilderness resource is paramount.
Congress designates wilderness to protect and preserve a variety of natural resource and other values; scenic value
is only one of many attributes. Uses and developments on private lands have the potential to impact a full range of wilderness
values, including scientific, cultural, historical, and water quality values. One of the most important aspects
of the recreational experience within wilderness is the opportunity for solitude and to experience an area where
man is only a temporary visitor. A standard which would allow development of new structures so long as they are not visible
from the wilderness simply ignores the fact that other, non-visual impacts may result from the construction of new
structures. Furthermore, the Forest Service is unaware of any location from which a new structure could be developed
within the wilderness and also not be visible because of the area's topography. As noted in the proposed rule, the repair
and maintenance of existing structures that may be located on private land within a wilderness is not affected by this
standard. Therefore, after considering this comment, no change was made in the final rule regarding the construction
of new or replacement structures in wilderness.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer objected to the lack of standards in the proposed rule for livestock grazing, timber harvesting, pesticide
use, water quality protection, and ground disturbing activities on private lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This concern is fully addressed by the proposed rule. In determining what approach it should take to the regulation
of private lands, the Forest Service determined that if other federal, state, and local laws and ordinances are enforced,
then the HCNRA Act's purposes would be accomplished. Accordingly, in developing the proposed rule, the agency assessed
existing ordinances and laws for their capability to protect on private lands the values for which the HCNRA was established.
In many instances, the proposed rule expressed these local ordinances as standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the proposed rule made it very clear that other laws would be enforced; if not by the promulgating government,
then, if necessary, by the Forest Service through acquisition (condemnation) action. In &sect;292.23 paragraph
(a)(1), the final rule retains the language of the proposed rule, with minor editing, to make clear that land uses are
compatible if they conform to applicable local, state, and federal laws. This provision is intended to cover such
matters as those referred to by the reviewer. Examples of the types of ordinances and laws that this clause refers to
include the following: Oregon Forest Practices Act; Idaho Forest Practices Act; Idaho Water Quality Standards and
Wastewater Treatment Requirements; Oregon Water Quality Standards; and the Idaho Agricultural Pollution Abatement
Plan. The Department is not aware of any situation which merits standards different from those currently imposed
by other laws. The proposed rule addressed the concerns raised by this reviewer by providing for compliance with environmental
and other laws and ordinances. Therefore, no modification has been made in the final rule as a result of this comment.

Additional Changes Adopted in the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the process of reviewing the comments on &sect;292.23, the Department recognized the need to make two other changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Residences on less than 160 acre parcels in farm/forest/grazing lands. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As drafted, the provision at &sect;292.23(b)(1) that limits residences on farm/forest/grazing lands to minimum
lots of 160 acres could be interpreted to mean that an existing house on a lot that is less than 160 acres would prompt
the Secretary to exercise the acquisition authority. This is not the Department's intent. It is recognized that some
of these smaller parcels have existed with residential developments for years and there is no reason that they should
not continue as a recognized nonconforming use. Consequently, the final rule is modified to make clear that nonconforming
lots (i.e., less than 160 acres) with permanently affixed residences (i.e., constructed on a foundation or basement),
existing on the effective date of the final rule, are in compliance with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sites used for the extraction of common mineral materials. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, at &sect;292.23 (a)(7), would only allowed extraction of common materials for road construction
and maintenance and would limit sites to not exceed 5 acres. The use limitation ignored other forms of construction
that may also use smaller quantities of materials, such as in the repair or construction of structures. It is impractical
to require a landowner to find a gravel source outside of the HCNRA boundaries, when a source may exist already within
a mile of his or her property. Upon reconsideration, the 5 acre size limit appears to be excessive for the foreseen uses
for this resource and the esthetic concerns for the HCNRA. Therefore, the final rule is modified to eliminate the references
to only road construction and maintenance and to decrease the size limit to not exceed 2 acres. As written, the final
rule may be more generally applied to the extraction of common mineral materials for construction and maintenance
purposes so long as these sites have screening and are less than 2 acres in size.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, this section provided an optional compliance determination process so that the landowner
could obtain assurance from the Ranger that existing or proposed uses of their land are compatible with the Act and
thus would not be acquired by the Secretary without their consent. A notice of noncompliance would mean that a proposed
or actual land use does not comply with the standards in &sect;292.23 and thus, could potentially trigger the initiation
of the Secretary's land acquisition authority, as authorized by the Act. This section also proposed a process for
reviewing a compliance or noncompliance decision.

Comment: Noncompliance results in condemnation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Condemnation is one option that may be considered in the event of a noncompliance determination. However, it is not
the only option. The proposed rule clearly states that if the Forest Service makes a noncompliance determination,
it will offer suggestions on how the land use or development could be modified to avoid this result. As noted previously,
condemnation is not the tool of choice to enforce compliance with the standards of this rule_it is the last resort.
In administering the HCNRA, the Forest Service position has been, and will continue to be, one which favors discussion,
negotiation, and cooperation with landowners to reach mutually satisfactory objectives wherever possible.

Three reviewers requested that the procedure to appeal a determination of compliance or noncompliance be modified
to exclude ``other interested parties.'' These reviewers felt that the petition process provided by this rule should
be strictly limited to the Forest Service and the affected landowner and that the involvement of outside parties would
unnecessarily complicate and prolong the process. Another reviewer supported the petition process as set out in

The Department agrees with the reviewers that requests for reviews of compliance and noncompliance determinations
involving ``other interested parties'' could be unnecessarily cumbersome and time consuming and that the review
process should be limited to those directly affected, i.e. the landowner whose property was the subject of the determination.
Accordingly, in the final rule, paragraph (c) of &sect;292.24 has been revised to limit petitions for review to affected
landowners.

in which proposals for use and development of private land in the HCNRA would be channeled through the existing local
mechanisms provided under the Wallowa County Land Use Development Ordinance and the Wallowa County Comprehensive
Land Use Plan. In this alternative, the HCNRA Ranger's role would be limited to that of an interested party who would
be able to testify in favor of or in opposition to a proposed use or development. However, if the Ranger opposed the proposal,
it would be his or her burden to prove that the proposal is contrary to the County Ordinance and Plan. According to this
reviewer, it is only through this mechanism that the standard of local citizen involvement required by state and local
law would be satisfied.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative is not one that the Department can implement and remain consistent with its responsibilities under
the HCNRA Act. The federal interest must be protected and cannot be dependent upon, or subservient to, state and local
zoning decisions. In effect, this alternative would relegate the Forest Service to the status of an interested party
whose comments would be considered by the County in the context of a pending development or use proposal. Forest Service
comments would not be binding on the commission, nor would they necessarily even be persuasive. It is difficult to
comprehend how the Forest Service could carry out its responsibilities under the HCNRA Act and effectively ensure
that activities on the private lands not impair the values for which Congress established the HCNRA under this system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the hope of the Department that the procedures currently in place at the state and local level will suffice to condition,
restrict, or preclude many incompatible uses or developments in the HCNRA. The standards adopted by the final rule
are from local zoning ordinances and applicable laws that already adequately protect the HCNRA. The County's disposition
of pending development proposals should, in most cases, result in decisions that are compatible with the purposes
of the HCNRA Act. However, in the event uses or developments are incompatible, or in the event that the County Ordinances
and Plan are amended in such a way as to lessen the restrictions on private lands which would thereby increase the potential
threat to the HCNRA, then the Forest Service must have the ability to enforce the standards needed to protect the HCNRA.
The rule as proposed provides this protection. Therefore, no change was made to &sect;292.24 in response to this comment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Having carefully considered the comments received on the proposed rule, and explained the basis for adopting or not
adopting changes proposed by reviewers, the Department hereby adopts a final rule to ensure that the use and development
of private lands within the Hells Canyon Recreation Area are compatible with the purposes for which Congress established
the Area and its management direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards established by the final rule are those essential to protection of the Area. The approach adopted is
not one of direct federal regulation of private land but rather one of relying, to the greatest extent possible, on
local zoning authority. The rule gives private landowners notice of those uses that are compatible with the purposes
of the HCNRA, provides a mechanism whereby the landowner and the agency may determine compliance or noncompliance
with the standards of the rule and gives constructive notice to private landowners that incompatible uses of private
land may trigger the use of the Secretary's condemnation authority. Nevertheless this rule is predicated on the premise
that the use of the Secretary's condemnation authority is to be a last resort and that the agency shall make every effort
to work harmoniously and cooperatively with private landowners to ensure protection of the HCNRA.

Regulatory Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
nor state or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise
new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, this final rule
is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this final rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and
it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as defined by that Act. To the extent that the rule imposes additional requirements on any small entity, these
requirements are the minimum necessary to protect the public interest, are not administratively burdensome or costly
to meet, and are well within the capability of small entities to perform.

Takings Implication
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since this rule is premised on the formal exercise of the Secretary's eminent domain authority, it is not an ``action''
as that term is defined in Section 2(c)(1) of Executive Order 12630. Nonetheless, the Office of General Counsel has
reviewed this rule for takings implications and determined that there is no risk of a taking related to this rule or
its implementation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Accordingly, (1) all state and local
laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule or which impede its full implementation are preempted; (2)
no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) it will not require administrative proceedings before parties
could file suit in court challenging its provisions.

This rulemaking was discussed as a proposed rule in the final Environmental Impact Statement and Comprehensive Management
Plan for the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, pages 155&hyph;158. The analysis completed for the Comprehensive
Management Plan was revalidated in April 1990 with the signing of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Land and Resource
Management (pages 1&hyph;2). Information pertaining to the environmental analysis may be obtained by writing or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As outlined in the rule at &sect;292.24, a landowner may request an optional compliance determination from the Forest
Service. As such, this rule contains information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements
are assigned control number 0596&hyph;0135 and are approved for use through March 1997.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 U.S.C. 460gg&hyph;460gg&hyph;13)
encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing,
farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, as they existed at the time
the HCNRA was established on December 31, 1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate
regulations establishing standards for the use and development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary
limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards are not met. The purpose of this subpart
is to establish standards that would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited condemnation authority
granted by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in this subpart establish standards applicable to all private property within the boundaries of
the HCNRA, including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells
Canyon Wilderness. The regulations in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of private property;
rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was established.
Uses not compatible with these standards could result in the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without
a landowner's consent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect a taking of private property, including valid,
existing water rights, nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a private landowner's property
use that is compatible with the purposes of the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this subpart
solely to determine whether private land uses or developments are compatible with the purposes and direction of the
Act and, if not, to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating condemnation proceedings to acquire
land or scenic easements.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations specified in 10 CFR Part 9 address the public's right of access to information held by NRC. Subpart
A prescribes procedures for making NRC agency records available to the public for inspection and copying under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and provides notice of procedures for obtaining NRC records otherwise publicly
available. Subpart B implements the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 with respect to the procedures by which individuals
may determine the existence of, seek access to, and request correction of NRC records concerning themselves. Subpart
B also covers the requirements applicable to NRC personnel with respect to the use and dissemination of such records.

The Petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 10, 1994, OCRE filed a petition for rulemaking under 10 CFR 2.802 with the NRC. OCRE filed an amendment to
the petition on April 11, 1994. The petitioner is a private, not-for-profit organization incorporated under the
laws of the State of Ohio. OCRE specializes in research and advocacy on nuclear safety issues and supports the highest
standards of safety and environmental protection. OCRE also supports the right of meaningful public participation
in the regulation of nuclear facilities. The petitioner was an intervenor in the operating license proceeding for
the Perry Nuclear Power Plant and has intervened in three operating license amendment cases regarding Perry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasons for the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the petitioner, the purpose of the petition is to request a change to the rules regarding public access
to information as stated in 10 CFR part 9, particularly information that is held by licensees but is not submitted to
the NRC. OCRE contends that it has observed a trend in the NRC's regulatory practice in the past several years that decreases
the amount of information to which the public has access. The petitioner believes that this trend is apparent in NRC
bulletins and generic letters issued over the past six years. OCRE states that these documents instruct licensees
to send conclusory statements that they have completed the requested actions to the NRC instead of instructing licensees
to send the NRC detailed documentation and analyses of their actions. The detailed records are kept at the plant site
where they are accessible only to NRC inspectors. The petitioner is particularly concerned because if these materials
are never sent to the NRC, they will not get into the Public Document Room and the public will never have access to them.
OCRE further states that the materials will not even be obtainable under the FOIA unless an NRC inspector happens to
make a copy of the requested documents and the documents are still in the agency's possession at the time the FOIA request
is filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE refers to the Station Blackout rule in &sect;50.63(a)(2), which states that ``the capability for coping with
a station blackout of specified duration shall be determined by an appropriate coping analysis. Utilities are expected
to have the baseline assumptions, analyses, and related information used in their coping evaluations available
for NRC review.'' It is not apparent to the petitioner that this material is actually sent to the NRC and made publicly
available.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner believes that other regulatory trends are also decreasing public access to information. OCRE states
that the Technical Specification Improvement Program encourages the removal of material from the plant technical
specifications and the relocation of it to internal plant documents. The petitioner included a list of recent generic
letters that enable licensees to relocate material from the plant technical specifications, a public document,
into other plant documents that may not be available to the public. According to the petitioner, about 36 percent of
current technical specification material will be relocated to internal plant documents under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that NRC's revised rules of practice place an even greater burden on public petitioners to provide
as much documentation and factual basis for contentions as early as possible while the access of petitioners to detailed
information is diminishing. The petitioner further states that if detailed information is never submitted to the
NRC, and thus never becomes accessible to the public, participants in proceedings will never be able to supply a basis
sufficient to support admission of contentions under the new rules of practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE believes that lack of public access to information on nuclear regulation undermines public confidence in the
NRC's regulatory program and is contrary to the public's statutory right to participate in the NRC regulatory process.
The petitioner also states that members of the public cannot fulfill the role of participating in the NRC regulatory
process, which Congress has bestowed upon them, without access to the detailed information that current NRC policies
are placing beyond the public's reach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the amendment to the petition, OCRE cited two additional examples of the lack of public access to licensee-held
information. The first example is NRC's proposed rule entitled ``Codes and Standards for Nuclear Power Plants; Subsection
IWE and Subsection IWL'' (59 FR 979, January 7, 1994), which states that ``In order to further reduce the burden on licensees
and NRC staff, the Subsection IWE and IWL portions of the ISI plan will not have to be submitted to the NRC for approval.
Licensees may simply retain their initial Subsection IWE and Subsection IWL plans at the site for audit.'' The second
example is NRC's final rule entitled ``Storage of Spent Fuel in NRC-Approved Storage Casks at Power Reactor Sites''
(55 FR 29161, July 18, 1990) which does not appear to require nuclear power plant users of the approved storage casks
to submit their site-specific evaluations, as required by &sect;72.212(b)(2), to the NRC. This section states that
``A copy of this record must be retained until spent fuel is no longer stored under the general license issued under
&sect;72.210.'' The petitioner further states that &sect;72.212(b)(10) only requires that general licensees
make records available to the NRC for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the amendment to the petition, the petitioner amended the language in its suggested &sect;9.301(b) to include
persons required by the proposed rule entitled ``Certification of Gaseous Diffusion Plants,'' published on February
11, 1994 (59 FR 6792), to obtain NRC certification of gaseous diffusion plants under proposed Part 76 in the definition
of ``possessor.'' OCRE requests that the NRC clarify that this proposed definition would include entities authorized
to dispose of radioactive materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner recommends a change to Part 9 to establish the public's right-to-know and to provide the public access
to copies of internal plant documents, subject to the exceptions necessary to protect sensitive information. The
suggested amendment would not require that licensees generate information that does not already exist in response
to a request. The petitioner believes that its suggested amendment would strike a proper balance between the public's
right to know and the rights of the licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner's suggested amendment would include appeal procedures. If a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requester is not satisfied with a licensee's response to a request for information, the requester could appeal the
matter to an Administrative Law Judge on the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel. According to the petitioner,
this option is the most appropriate and efficient one for appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

OCRE believes that its suggested amendment to Part 9 would impose a minimal burden on licensees and that this minor
burden would be justified by the substantial increase in meaningful public participation. According to the petitioner,
the proposed amendment to Part 9 would also enhance the public's confidence in the NRC's regulatory program.

 The Board is publishing for public comment proposed changes to Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) and to the
instructions and reporting forms that financial institutions must use in complying with the annual reporting requirements
under the regulation. The principal reasons for the proposed amendments are to respond to the statutory provisions
regarding earlier availability of the HMDA disclosure statements to the public; help improve the quality of the HMDA
data; and provide clarifications requested by financial institutions that report under HMDA. The amendments would
set an earlier deadline for reporting HMDA data to supervisory agencies; require reporting in machine-readable
format; require institutions to keep their loan application registers current during the year as data are being collected;
and make a number of other changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Board's Regulation C (12 CFR part 203) implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The regulation requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to report annually
to federal supervisory agencies, and disclose to the public, information about their home mortgage and home improvement
lending activity. The reports and disclosures cover loan originations, applications that do not result in originations
(for example, applications that are denied or withdrawn), and purchases of loans. Information reported includes
the location of the property to which the loan or application relates; the race or national origin, gender, and income
of the applicant; and the type of purchaser for loans sold in the secondary market. For denied applications, lenders
are also permitted to report the reasons for denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lenders are required to report originations, applications, and purchased loans for each calendar year to their supervisory
agency by March 1 of the following year. The reports are made on a HMDA Loan/Application Register (HMDA&hyph;LAR)
in a transaction-by-transaction format; for reports containing more than 100 entries, lenders currently are expected
to submit the data in automated form (magnetic tape or diskette). The lender's supervisory agency submits the data
to the Federal Reserve Board, which processes the data on behalf of member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Board then prepares public
disclosure statements for each reporting lender and aggregate reports covering the data for all lenders in a metropolitan
area. The statements are sent to lenders, generally by July or August, and the lenders are required to make the statements
available to the public at their home office and at certain branch offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although lenders must make the disclosure statements available within three business days, they have a thirty-day
period within which to review the statements prepared by the Board and to report any discrepancies to the agencies.
After necessary revisions have been made, the Board prepares and sends disclosure statements for all reporting lenders
in each MSA, along with aggregate disclosure tables covering all such lenders, to a central data depository in each
MSA. The central depositories are usually public libraries, regional planning agencies, or other public offices;
the disclosures are generally sent to the depositories by October.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Explanation of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the principal reasons the Board is proposing to amend Regulation C is the need to make HMDA data available to the
public earlier than has been the case in the past. Statutory amendments to HMDA enacted in 1992 provide that starting
with the HMDA reports for calendar year 1994, disclosure statements for individual lenders should be available to
the public by July 1 of the following year, and that aggregate tables should be available at the central depositories
by September 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet this timetable, it will be necessary for the agencies to begin processing the raw data earlier than March 1.
Therefore, the proposed amendments include a change in the deadline for data submission, requiring lenders to submit
their data by February 1 instead of March 1. Some of the other proposed amendments also are intended, in part, to facilitate
earlier availability of the data (see discussion concerning the proposed change to &sect;203.5(a), below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another important reason the Board is proposing amendments to Regulation C relates to the accuracy of the HMDA data.
The accuracy of the HMDA reports produced under the new data collection system that was instituted in 1990 (following
an expansion of the data collected under HMDA) has improved in each succeeding year, but concerns continue to exist
about data quality. A major part of what is involved in ensuring data accuracy relates to matters that are in the control
of reporting institutions; for example, lending institutions must devote adequate resources to the task of accurately
compiling and checking data before reporting it. However, to the extent that any requirements of the regulation are
unclear or complicated, consistent and accurate reporting is more difficult. Accordingly, some of the proposed
amendments now being published are intended in whole or in part to make the reporting requirements clearer or simpler.
In addition, another proposed amendment calls for reporting in machine-readable format; this change also should
help improve data quality, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board solicits comment generally on other ways in which Regulation C might be changed to better address problems
of accuracy of the HMDA data. For example, would allowing or requiring all home equity lines to be reported_rather
than only the portion of a line the borrower intends to use for home improvement or home purchase_simplify reporting
and bring about greater consistency? Would the same be true for other categories of loans? (On a similar point, refer
to the discussion of possible changes in the types of refinancings that should be reported, in section (3), ``Other
Matters on Which the Board Solicits Comment,'' below.) Are there areas in which explanations could be made simpler
or clearer, thereby facilitating more accurate reporting? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes its intention to publish within the next several months a proposed staff commentary to Regulation
C. The commentary will provide a vehicle for interpretations that would help lenders better understand and comply
with the regulation's requirements. The commentary will supplement the detailed instructions provided in appendix
A to Regulation C for completion of the HMDA-LAR and in the Guide to HMDA Reporting: Getting It Right, the brochure published
by the FFIEC and distributed by the individual agencies. The Board is in the process of drafting the commentary, and
solicits comment from lenders identifying specific areas that the commentary should address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below is a section-by-section discussion of the proposed amendments to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 203.2_Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)_Home Improvement Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise the regulation's definition of ``home improvement loan'' to facilitate compliance. The
existing definition sets two conditions: first, that the loan applicant state, at the time of the application, that
the loan is for the purpose of repairing, rehabilitating, or remodeling a dwelling; and second, that the loan be classified
in the records of the financial institution as a home improvement loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One change proposed by the Board relates to the first part of the definition_that the loan be for the purpose of repairing,
rehabilitating, or remodeling a dwelling. Questions have arisen about situations in which a loan is made for the purpose
of making improvements to the borrower's residential property, but not, strictly speaking, to the ``dwelling''
as defined under Regulation C. The regulation defines dwelling as a residential structure, whether or not attached
to real property. Thus, for example, a dwelling under Regulation C includes a house, apartment building, or mobile
home, but not necessarily the land upon which the house or other structure is located. Some institutions have asked
whether a loan for building or repairing things such as a detached garage, a driveway, a fence, or landscaping should
qualify as a home improvement loan for HMDA purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid technical distinctions based on whether a loan relates to the structure or to the land on which it is situated,
the Board proposes to change the home improvement loan definition to focus primarily on the applicant's statement
of purpose for the loan. Thus, a loan would qualify as a home improvement loan for HMDA purposes if the applicant states,
at the time of the loan application, that the loan is for ``home improvement purposes.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also proposes to eliminate the second part of the definition, which would make the manner in which an institution
classifies a loan irrelevant to its treatment for HMDA purposes. This part of the definition was originally intended
to minimize the regulatory burden on financial institutions, by not requiring an institution to report a loan as a
home improvement loan on its HMDA-LAR if the institution did not record the loan as a home improvement loan for other
purposes. Many institutions now indicate that they would like to report loans that in fact are for home improvement
purposes, but they find it difficult to do so because the loans may not be ``classified'' in the institution's records
as home improvement loans. Removing the classification test would resolve this problem. However, the Board solicits
comment on the extent to which this proposed change would create significant compliance burdens for institutions
that do not currently record such loans on the HMDA&hyph;LAR but now would be required to do so. Comment is also requested
generally on the overall advantages and disadvantages of making this change.

The regulation currently requires covered institutions to report HMDA data for a given calendar year to supervisory
agencies by March 1 of the following year, but does not specify when the data must be recorded on the HMDA&hyph;LAR.
The Board proposes to require institutions to fully record transactions within one month after final action is taken
(such as origination of a loan, or denial or withdrawal of an application). The Board believes this approach would
help in improving the accuracy and timeliness of the HMDA data. Current-year registers would be available to examiners
so that, if problems were occurring, the supervisory agency could work with the institution to ensure that errors
were corrected well before the relatively brief period between the end of the year and the reporting deadline. Another
advantage of the proposed change would be that examiners and the institution itself would have ready access to current
data that could be helpful in assessing its fair lending and community reinvestment performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes that some institutions may compile and geocode transactions (assign MSA, state, county, and
census tract codes) on a batch basis, from time to time during the year or at year-end. The Board solicits comment on
how burdensome institutions that currently follow this procedure would find it to record all the LAR information,
including the geographic codes, on the HMDA&hyph;LAR within one month after final action. In addition, comment is
requested on the extent to which any burden might be reduced if the requirement were to keep the HMDA&hyph;LAR up to
date on a quarterly basis, rather than monthly. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes a thirty-day requirement
on the HMDA-covered institutions it supervises; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency proposed a similar
requirement, and recently adopted a quarterly update requirement instead (see 59 FR 26411, May 20, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that a requirement to update the HMDA_LAR within one month after each transaction would be an important
step toward improving the accuracy and timeliness of HMDA data reporting; if the compliance burden appeared to outweigh
the advantages, however, the Board would consider alternatives such as quarterly updating.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting income. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes to revise the regulation to clarify how institutions report applicants' income and eliminate
an internal inconsistency that now exists. Currently, &sect;203.4(a)(7) of Regulation C provides that financial
institutions shall collect data on ``income relied upon in processing the loan application.'' The instructions
for completing the HMDA&hyph;LAR state that if no income is asked for or relied on in the credit decision, the lender
may enter NA (not applicable) in this field (appendix A, paragraph V.D.5.c.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes that lenders must report all income reflected on the application, including income of coapplicants,
whether or not the lender relies on a particular source of income. If the lender determined, in the course of verifying
information, that some portion of the income reported by the applicant was overstated, the lender would enter the
verified amount rather than the amount originally reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently lenders need not report income for streamlined refinancings in which they neither ask for nor rely on income
information. In addition, for privacy reasons, an institution need not record applicants' income on the HMDA&hyph;LAR
for loans made to the institution's own employees. These rules will remain in place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, institutions are required to file their HMDA data with supervisory agencies by March 1 following the year
to which the data relate. The Board proposes to change the due date to February 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statutory amendments contained in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 3889, provide that
starting with loan and application data for calendar year 1994, the FFIEC shall make ``every effort'' to ensure that
individual lenders' public disclosure statements are available at the lenders' offices before July 1 of the following
year. Similarly, the amendments call for the FFIEC to make both the individual disclosures and the aggregate tables
available at the central depositories before September 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the individual lenders' disclosure statements for 1992 lending activity became available to the public
the first week of August, and the disclosure statements and aggregate reports became available at central depositories
the first week of November. This year, the processing schedule calls for disclosures to be available at institutions
in July and at central depositories in October. Thus, progress is being made toward meeting the statutory targets
for earlier availability of HMDA data. But given the high volume of data being processed, the Board believes it is necessary
to move up the date for submitting the raw data to supervisory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting in Machine-Readable Format. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In processing the HMDA data, the Board and the other agencies use various means to identify and correct data errors.
For example, the data are run through computerized edit checks designed to detect errors and omissions in the data
fields. Where these are found, the agencies send the reports back to the institution for correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lenders whose HMDA&hyph;LAR contains more than 100 line entries are generally expected by the agencies to submit
their data in machine-readable format, such as PC diskette or magnetic tape. The Board and the other agencies have
encouraged lenders to submit their HMDA&hyph;LARs in automated form, and all but one of the agencies provide PC software
that can be used to compile data on diskettes. This software has built-in edit checks for accuracy and is furnished
free of charge. Software packages that are widely available from private vendors also contain the computerized edits
used by the Board. Nonetheless, many lending institutions still submit their HMDA data in paper form, and the agencies
have found that these paper submissions tend to contain a substantially higher number of errors than submissions
in machine-readable form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes to require that all institutions report HMDA data in machine-readable form and that they edit their
data before submitting it, either using the agency-supplied HMDA software or using the same edits in private vendors'
software. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change would help lenders to ensure submission of accurate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall accuracy of the data has improved each year since 1990, the first year of expanded reporting under the amendments
in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, in part because institutions have increasingly
submitted data by diskette, magnetic tape, or Fedline. However, further improvements in data quality are needed,
and the pre-edited reporting of data in machine-readable form would help in bringing about such improvements. Machine-readable
reporting would also assist the agencies in meeting the new public disclosure deadlines, by reducing the time needed
to enter the data from each reporting institution into the HMDA processing database. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes that some financial institutions subject to HMDA might not have the computer capability to compile
and report their data in machine-readable form. The Board solicits comment, therefore, on whether requiring machine-readable
data submission from all institutions would create a hardship for some, and if so, whether supervisory agencies should
have discretion to grant waivers from this requirement on a case-by-case basis. For example, a waiver might be granted
in a case where an institution does not itself own or have ready access to a personal computer nor have access through
a service provider.

Paragraph (e)_Notice of Availability

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes to make a technical change to &sect;203.5(e) concerning the notice of availability that institutions
are required to post. Pursuant to amendments contained in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, lending
institutions must now make available to the public not only their disclosure statements but also their loan/application
registers (after deleting certain data fields). These statutory amendments were incorporated into Regulation
C in March 1993 (see 58 FR 13403, March 11, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will revise the notice language to reflect that HMDA data in addition to disclosure statements
are available from institutions.

 The proposal includes a change in the reporting deadline from March 1 to February 1; paragraph III. A. in the instructions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paragraphs B and C._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requirement to report total HMDA&hyph;LAR entries on transmittal sheet. The regulation requires that a transmittal
sheet accompany an institution's HMDA&hyph;LAR data submission, containing general information such as the name,
address, and identifying numbers of the institution. Currently, the transmittal sheet does not ask for the total
number of transaction line entries contained in the HMDA submission, although the instructions encourage institutions
to provide this record count in a cover letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes to amend Regulation C to require financial institutions to report on the transmittal sheet (in
both the paper-copy and machine-readable versions) the total number of line entries included in the data submission.
Respondents also will be asked to send a transmittal sheet with any subsequent submission of data, rather than only
with the initial submission. An institution will sometimes send HMDA data to its supervisory agency in more than one
submission when revisions to the initial submission are necessary, for example, or because transactions were found
to have been inadvertently omitted. The count on the transmittal sheet for each submission will help the agencies
verify the number of line entries submitted by the institution at that time. This change would help reduce the likelihood
of any data being lost during the collection process.

changes. See the discussion of home improvement loan issues under &sect;203.2(f), above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Loan amount. f. Reporting counteroffers. The proposal clarifies that counteroffers are to be reported as loan
denials if the applicant does not accept the counteroffer, not as applications withdrawn or approved but not accepted.
This clarification conforms with the treatment of counteroffers in Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 5. Outside MSA. Financial institutions are encouraged but not required to enter geographic information for loans
on property located outside the MSAs in which they have a home or branch office (or outside any MSA). The proposed rule
clarifies that, if a lender enters data in the property location fields of the HMDA&hyph;LAR for these loans, the data
must accurately reflect the location of the property in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other Matters on Which the Board Solicits Comment. In addition to seeking comment on the proposed amendments,
the Board solicits comment on other matters related to HMDA reporting: prequalification programs, refinancing
transactions, and the collection of racial or ethnic information, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prequalification programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulation C requires lenders to compile and report data on applications for loans as well as on loan originations.
The Board has received questions about mortgage lenders' prequalification programs, asking whether and when a request
for prequalification must be treated as a credit application for purposes of HMDA reporting. The answer depends on
the outcome of the prequalification decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of application under HMDA is virtually identical to the definition established by the Board's Regulation
B (Equal Credit Opportunity). Accordingly, lenders are directed to the guidance provided in the Official Staff Commentary
to Regulation B, comments 2(f)&hyph;1 through &hyph;4, on differentiating between applications and inquiries.
The commentary states that if a lender_in giving information to a consumer_evaluates information about the consumer,
decides to decline a credit request, and communicates this to the consumer, the creditor has treated that inquiry
as an application for credit (by virtue of having made a credit decision). In the case of Regulation B, the creditor
must then comply with the notification rules on adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to HMDA reporting, the same rule applies, and a lender that turns down a prequalification request (because
of the homebuyer's poor credit history, for example) must report it as a loan denial on its HMDA&hyph;LAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prequalification requests that are approved, on the other hand, will be reported on the HMDA&hyph;LAR at a later stage
in the process, after homebuyers have found the property they want to purchase and the lender has evaluated a formal
loan application, not at the time of the prequalification approval. Thus, the lender will report when: (1) the lender
originates a loan; (2) the lender has made a firm loan offer that the applicant does not accept; (3) the applicant expressly
withdraws the mortgage application; (4) the lender closes the file for incompleteness; or (5) the lender denies the
mortgage loan application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, lender decisions on prequalifications that are approved may ultimately not be reported on the HMDA&hyph;LAR;
if a homebuyer who has been prequalified for credit does not later pursue a formal application for a mortgage loan,
the lender has no reporting obligations under HMDA (and no notification requirements under Regulation B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For denials of prequalification requests that are reportable under HMDA, there are questions about how a lender can
comply with the reporting requirements with regard to the loan amount, loan type, and property location data fields
on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. Generally speaking, a property location will not ``exist'' at the prequalification stage
if the prospective homebuyer does not yet have a purchase contract on, or has not requested financing for, a specific
property. Thus, the lender should enter NA (not applicable) in each of the location fields in such instances. For loan
amount, if the prospective homebuyer has not requested a particular amount of credit, the regulation currently does
not provide any alternative code. The Board requests comment on whether a code such as NA (not applicable) will suffice,
or whether a special code_indicating that the transaction is a prequalification_would be more appropriate and useful.
Similar issues arise with respect to loan type in cases where prospective borrowers have not specified during the
prequalification process the type of loan they are seeking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests comment about other compliance issues related to prequalifications, and contemplates that guidance
regarding these matters will be provided in the commentary to Regulation C to be issued later this year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting of refinancings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation requires lenders to report refinancings, which are defined as loans involving the satisfaction of
an existing obligation and its replacement by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower. The Board solicits
comment on the reporting of transactions that are not technically refinancings, but that serve as the functional
equivalent of refinancings. In some regions, transactions are structured as modifications of existing obligations
(sometimes called modification, extension, and consolidation agreements or ``MECAs''), rather than as replacements
thereof, often in order to reduce borrower costs associated with a refinancing (for example, title insurance fees).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions have inquired whether they should report such transactions, which serve the same purpose as refinancings
and normally entail the same underwriting procedures. The Board solicits comment on this matter. The Board also solicits
comment on what types of modifications should not be subject to reporting (such as the simple modification of a loan
term from 25 to 15 years), as well as the basis for any such distinctions. Other issues on which comment is requested
include whether the reporting of such transactions should be limited to cases where a new lender is offering the modification,
or should also be available to the original lender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another matter on which the Board seeks comment concerns the current exclusion for certain refinancings based on
the purpose of the transaction. Under existing Regulation C, a refinancing is to be reported only if the loan being
refinanced was a home purchase or home improvement loan, or was a refinancing of such a loan. In addition, a refinancing
is reported only if the amount outstanding on the loan being refinanced, plus the amount of any new money for home purchase
or home improvement purposes, is equal to more than 50 percent of the total new loan amount. For example, if a borrower
refinances a home purchase loan only for the purpose of getting a lower interest rate on the outstanding balance, and
therefore does not obtain any new money, the refinancing is reported because the amount outstanding on the original
loan is equal to 100 percent of the new loan amount. Similarly, if a borrower refinances a home purchase loan and obtains
new money to be used entirely for home improvement purposes, then again the refinancing is reported because here again,
the amount outstanding plus new money for ``covered purposes'' (home improvement and home purchase) is equal to 100
percent of the new loan amount. At the other extreme, if a borrower refinances a loan with an outstanding balance of
$20,000 and obtains $40,000 of new money to be used for starting a new business, the refinancing is not reported because
the amount outstanding plus new money for ``covered purposes'' is equal to only one-third of the new loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This purpose test for determining whether refinancings are to be reported under Regulation C has generated a substantial
number of questions from lenders. For example, the purpose of the loan being refinanced may not be clear at the time
the borrower applies for the refinancing. In some cases, a loan has been refinanced repeatedly, new money having been
obtained each time; and the calculations necessary to determine whether more than 50 percent of the total new loan
amount is for covered purposes become difficult. An alternative approach that would be easier to understand and apply
would be to treat all refinancings as subject to reporting on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. Although such an expansion in coverage
would result in the disclosed data's being less tied to the home purchase and home improvement categories, it is not
clear that the resulting data would be less useful. The Board solicits comment on the advantages and disadvantages
of these changes, both for reporting institutions and for users of HMDA data.

Collection of racial or ethnic information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation C provides that applicants for mortgage and home improvement loans be requested, but not required, to
provide information about their race or national origin, gender, and income. The purpose is to gather data that may
help regulatory agencies to gauge whether a lending institution is complying with the fair lending laws. If an applicant
chooses not to provide the information on race or national origin and gender, the loan officer is required to enter
the information on the basis of visual observation or surname. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the categories in Regulation C for data collection on race/national origin of applicants are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;American Indian or Alaskan Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Asian or Pacific Islander 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;White 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The categories that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues for government statistical purposes are substantially
the same, except that the ``other'' category is not included. OMB and others have indicated their belief that the presence
of the ``other'' category undercuts the usefulness of the data, in that a data user has no way of knowing what the category
represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In adopting the monitoring provisions of Regulation C in 1989, the Board based the categories used on Regulation B,
which has contained the ``other'' category since it was first adopted by the Board in 1976. The Board believed that
the ``other'' category served a useful function. For example, it provides a choice to applicants who do not identify
with any of the specifically defined categories; in 1992, the ``other'' category was used in roughly 45,000 out of
10 million loan records. The Board notes also that OMB is likely in the next few years to propose changing the list of
categories for the next decennial census. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is solicited on whether the Board should consider deleting the ``other'' category. The Board notes that if
this change were made for Regulation C, a parallel change would be made in the monitoring provisions of Regulation
B.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would require FDIC-insured mutual state-chartered savings banks that are not members of the Federal
Reserve System (State Savings Banks) to comply with new substantive provisions of the FDIC's regulations when proposing
to convert to the stock form of ownership. The intended effect of the proposed rule is to assure that certain aspects
of mutual-to-stock conversions of FDIC-regulated institutions do not engender safety-and-soundness concerns,
breaches of fiduciary duty or other violations of law.

II. Recent FDIC Regulatory Initiatives on Mutual-To-Stock Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years numerous mutually owned State Savings Banks have converted to stockholder-owned State Savings Banks.
Many of the institutions that converted from mutual to stock form first converted from federal or state mutual savings
associations regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to State Savings Banks. One consequence of these
conversions to State Savings Banks is that the FDIC replaces the OTS as the institution's primary federal regulator.
Mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks are generally subject to the rules and entitled to the protections
of the applicable state law.

Conversion rules under state law are not identical to and in some cases are less stringent than OTS regulations. The
absence of consistent treatment under state laws and the lack of some federal oversight of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock
conversions present an opportunity for inconsistency and abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of concerns about prior and potential abuses in the conversion process, on February 1, 1994, the FDIC issued
for public comment a proposed policy statement on the conversions of State Savings Banks from mutual to stock ownership
(Proposed Policy Statement). 59 FR 4712. The general purpose of the Proposed Policy Statement was to solicit public
comment on the issues involved in mutual-to-stock conversions and whether and how the FDIC should regulate this activity.
The areas of FDIC concern identified in the Proposed Policy Statement were: (1) Proper appraisal of the institution
to be sold; (2) proper pricing of the stock sold in the conversion; (3) fair apportionment of the stock subscription
rights; (4) adequate disclosure of information needed to make an informed investment decision; and (5) non-abusive
compensation and benefits provided to insiders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposed Policy Statement the Board of Directors of the FDIC (Board) determined
that during the pendency of the Proposed Policy Statement it was necessary for the FDIC to review applications filed
by State Savings Banks with their respective state banking regulator and any other applicable state and federal banking
and/or securities regulators to determine whether the proposed conversions contain any safety and soundness issues
and/or issues of insider abuse that reflect negatively on the integrity and competence of the management of the converting
institution. The Board's concerns were caused by several recent and pending mutual-to-stock conversions of State
Savings Banks that had given rise to questions related to management abuse and excessive enrichment of insiders,
fairness to depositors and general safety and soundness concerns. These conversions have recently been the subject
of Congressional hearings and numerous news articles and reports. The FDIC also had received (and continues to receive)
direct complaints from depositors of State Savings Banks about unfair treatment and insider abuse in mutual-to-stock
conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, on February 15, 1994, the FDIC issued an interim final rule adding a new section to Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations
(to be published at 12 CFR 303.15) prohibiting State Savings Banks from converting to stock form without complying
with the requirements of the interim rule (Interim Rule). 59 FR 7194. The Interim Rule requires State Savings Banks
that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form consisting
of a description of the proposed conversion accompanied by a copy of all documentation and application materials
filed with the applicable state and federal regulators. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC currently reviews
all conversion materials regarding State Savings Banks with a special interest in: The use of the proceeds from the
sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; the adequacy of the disclosure materials; the participation of
depositors in approving the transaction; the form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members
on the conversion; any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights
and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion;
the adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining
the price of the shares of stock to be sold; the process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing
of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; the nature and apportionment of stock subscription
rights; and the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community. In a proposed
merger/conversion, the FDIC pays particular attention to the value offered to depositors of the converting institution
and the compensation packages offered to management.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated in the Interim Rule, the FDIC generally expects proposed conversions to substantially satisfy the standards
found in the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations of the OTS (12 CFR Part 563b). Any variance from those regulations
is closely scrutinized. As also indicated in the Interim Rule, however, compliance with OTS requirements is not necessarily
sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes. The Interim Rule specifies that the FDIC will look to the OTS rules ``currently
in effect'' at the time the FDIC reviews the proposed conversion. As indicated below, the OTS recently revised its
mutual-to-stock conversion regulations. Thus, upon the issuance of the OTS revised regulations on May 3, 1994 (59
FR 22725), the FDIC began taking into account the extent to which proposed conversions of State Savings Banks conform
with the various provisions of the OTS' revised regulations. The Interim Rule remains effective during the pendency
of this proposed rulemaking.

III. Comments Received on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing and issuing this proposed rule it was helpful for the FDIC staff and the Board to consider the comments
received on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule. It is anticipated that the Board will again consider
those comments when taking final action on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule. Some issues identified
and discussed in the comments are not germane to the proposed rule, but may be relevant when the Board takes final action
on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule; thus, although they are mentioned briefly in the summary of comments
provided below, those issues are not otherwise discussed in the context of this proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule the FDIC specifically requested comment on, among other issues:
What abuses are prevalent in mutual-to-stock conversions and why the FDIC should take action against such abuses;
whether federal oversight in conversions of State Savings Banks is necessary; whether the FDIC should issue a regulation
closely following the OTS conversion regulations or the FDIC should take a less formal approach; whether the FDIC
should seek Congressional action in this area; and the mechanics and substantive provisions of the Interim Rule.

IV. Need for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently the OTS revised its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations primarily to address immediate concerns about
excessive management remuneration and inadequate depositor participation in conversions of savings associations
(59 FR 22725 (May 3, 1994)) (OTS Revisions). In essence, the new regulations attempt to prevent management abuses
by strengthening the rights of depositors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC believes that the OTS Revisions are a necessary, sound first step in correcting certain abuses stemming from
conversions and that the absence of some federal oversight of mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks
presents an opportunity for inconsistency and abuse. Thus, the FDIC thinks it may be necessary and appropriate to
adopt regulations similar to the OTS Revisions. For these reasons, as discussed below, the FDIC is issuing this proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the fundamental problem concerning the distribution of existing economic value in mutual-to-stock conversions
is not addressed by the OTS Revisions, however, the Board believes other forms of abuse may still arise. The FDIC believes
that it is necessary to re-examine the conversion process to explore whether the existing economic value of a converting
mutual institution can be better distributed directly to those who should receive it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC is particularly concerned about the appraisals of converting institutions. The FDIC believes that under
the current process it may be difficult to prepare an appraisal of a well capitalized mutual institution which accurately
reflects ``pro forma value'' while at the same time reflecting the appraised value cogently in a business plan of the
institution. The incidence of significant appreciation in the stock price immediately after the initial public
offering, which tends to exceed the stock appreciation of initial public offerings in other industries, suggests
that appraisals may be too low. As a possible consequence of underpricing the institution, insiders may be able to
acquire more shares than they are entitled to; moreover, a low appraisal may deprive an institution of the additional
capital it should receive in the sale of conversion stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the possible need for fundamental changes to the mutual-to-stock conversions process, concurrently
with the publication of this proposed rule, the Board also is publishing a request for comments on ways to address concerns
about the overall conversion process (Request For Comments). The Request For Comments is a separate notice contained
elsewhere in this issue of the

V. Explanation of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would impose several specific requirements upon State Savings Banks that propose to undergo mutual-to-stock
conversions. The proposed requirements are similar to the OTS Revisions. Currently and during the pendency of this
proposed rulemaking, the FDIC intends to continue to use the case-by-case methodology explained in the Interim Rule
in reviewing notices of proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. As noted above and in the Interim Rule, this FDIC
review includes an analysis of whether the proposed conversion would comply with current OTS mutual-to-stock conversions
rules. Subsequent to the adoption of a final rule, the FDIC intends to continue to use a case-by-case approach in reviewing
aspects of proposed conversions that are outside the scope of the specific requirements in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other things, the proposed rule also would indicate that the requirements thereof apply, to the extent appropriate,
to the reorganization of State Savings banks to the mutual holding company form of ownership. The FDIC also is involved
in the mutual holding company reorganizations of federal and state savings associations. That involvement entails
FDIC action on the application for deposit insurance required to be filed with the FDIC in such transactions for the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
stock depository institution organized to facilitate the reorganization. In acting on applications for deposit
insurance the FDIC must consider the factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1816),
one of which is the ``general character and fitness of the management of the depository institution.'' In the course
of that review the FDIC considers, among other things, the same issues of fiduciary duty that it considers in reviewing
proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, preliminarily, the FDIC believes that each of the requirements in the proposed rule is necessary
to satisfy specific FDIC concerns about safety and soundness and/or breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with
mutual-to-stock conversions. At the same time, the FDIC believes that it is essential to consider the existence of
state regulation and supervision in determining the proper role in the conversion process for the FDIC as the primary
federal regulator of State Savings Banks. As discussed below, many of the comments that the FDIC received on the Proposed
Policy Statement and the Interim Rule expressed agreement with the FDIC's federal oversight role in mutual-to-stock
conversions of State Savings Banks, but several also suggested that deference be paid to states' rights on issues
outside the FDIC's areas of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the issuance of the proposed rule, the Board is attempting to strike the proper balance in this regard. In particular,
the proposed rule includes a provision stating that, in the event that a State Savings Bank proposing to convert determines
that compliance with any provision of the proposed rule would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state
law, the bank may file with the FDIC a written request for waiver of compliance with the provision. The request would
have to demonstrate that the requested waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail
a breach of fiduciary duty by the bank's management, or otherwise be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors,
any other insured depository institution(s), the federal deposit insurance funds or the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, recently the OTS revised its regulations on mutual-to-stock conversions of savings associations.
OTS' concerns about avoiding insider abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions of federal and state savings associations
are the same as the FDIC's concerns about insider abuses in conversions of State Savings Banks. Thus, as noted above,
to the extent necessary and appropriate, the proposed rule incorporates most of the same requirements recently adopted
by the OTS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would: Require the submission of a full appraisal report, including a complete and detailed description
of the elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support
for the conclusions reached therein; require a depositor vote on all mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings
Banks and prohibit management's use of previously executed (or ``running'') proxies to satisfy depositor voting
requirements; for one year following the date of the conversion, among other things, require that any management
recognition plans or stock option plans be implemented only after shareholder approval is received, require that
stock options (if any) be granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant and
prohibit MRPs funded by conversion proceeds; require that the record date for determining depositors eligible to
receive rights to participate in the subscription offering of the conversion stock not be less than one year prior
to the date of adoption of the plan of conversions by the converting bank's board of trustees; require that the subscription
offering provide a preference to eligible depositors and others in the bank's ``local community'' (as defined in
the proposed rule) or within 100 miles of the bank's home office or branch(es); require that employee stock ownership
plans (ESOPs) not have a priority over subscription rights of ``eligible depositors'' (as defined in the proposed
rule); require the submission of a business plan, including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management
intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion; and prohibit stock repurchases within
one year following the conversion.

2. Discussion of Each Proposed Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a discussion of each of the requirements in the proposed rule. Many of the requirements are engendered
by the Board's concerns about bank management's proper exercise of its fiduciary duties. As discussed in the preamble
to the Interim Rule, the duties and obligations of trustees and officers of mutual savings banks are identical to the
responsibilities the FDIC has historically enunciated and enforced concerning directors and officers of commercial
banks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The two principal duties of care and loyalty that directors and officers of commercial banks must exercise on behalf
of the institution and its constituencies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, depositors, creditors and shareholders) also obligate trustees of mutual savings banks. Both duties have long
antecedents in the common law of corporations and financial institutions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trustees (as well as officers) of mutual savings institutions are held to the same standard of care and loyalty as directors
and officers of stock banks. Thus, the trustees must fulfill their duty of loyalty to the institution by administering
its affairs with the utmost candor, personal honesty and integrity. They are prohibited from advancing their own
personal or business interests or those of others at the expense of the bank. This general fiduciary duty has been frequently
interpreted to include an element of fairness and good faith which, in the context of mutual-to-stock conversions,
affords protection to the various stakeholders (particularly depositors) of mutual savings banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC, through the Interim Rule, also requires the trustees of mutual savings banks to adhere to the same standards
of loyalty and care that are required of directors and officers of stock institutions in order to prevent insider abuse.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publicized insider abuse (and the lawsuits that such abuses may engender) may have a sufficiently significant impact
upon the reputation of a bank to affect its continued viability and, thus, its safety and soundness, resulting in a
regulatory violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, the requirements in the proposed rule are rooted in concerns about safety and soundness, breaches
of fiduciary duty and/or other violations of law.

A. Submission of a Full Appraisal Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock ownership to submit to the FDIC,
along with the other required materials, a full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and the pricing
of the conversion stock. Many of the states require that a converting mutual savings banks sell its capital stock at
a total price equal to its estimated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value, based on an independent valuation. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that the converting
institution receives the full value for the conversion stock sold. As indicated above and in the Request For Comments,
the FDIC has identified what may be significant problems with the overall conversion process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in detail in the Request For Comments, many recent mutual-to-stock conversions have exhibited significant
increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market for the stock. The FDIC is concerned that such increases
have resulted from appraisal reports (submitted in connection with these recent conversions) that have set the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value significantly below the true value of the converting institution. If an appraisal is too low and the shares
of stock are underpriced, the institution receives less of an increase in capital than it should from the sale of conversion
stock; in addition, the deposit insurance fund is provided with less of a capital cushion than would have resulted
if the stock was based on a proper and adequate appraisal. Also, an underpriced appraisal could entice insiders to
undertake a conversion (in order to acquire shares below their fair value) that may not be in the best interests of the
institution. Sophisticated investors also are able to benefit, undeservedly, from the sale of underpriced conversion
stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the proposed rule would require that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock
conversion of a State Savings Bank. The appraisal report would have to be prepared by an independent appraiser and
include a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up the report, justification for the methodology
employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. This would include a full discussion of the
applicability of each peer group member and documented analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below)
the converting institution may have from the peer group statistics. The FDIC would require a complete analysis of
the institution's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 earnings which should include the bank's full potential once it fully deploys the new capital pursuant to its business
plan. In reviewing appraisal reports the FDIC would continue to consider the appraisal standards and guidelines,
if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC generally has been disappointed with the appraisal reports it has reviewed in connection with proposed conversions.
As noted above, many appraisals have set the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value of the converting institution significantly below the true value of the institution as derived from
its peer group. Reasons for this have included inappropriate peer-group selections, inconsistencies between the
analysis in the appraisal report and the business plan submitted with the conversion notice and continued unfounded
justification for new issue discounts in stock issuances that have been well oversubscribed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC has noted that appraisals lack specific detail on the inclusion of peer group members regarding particular
information on: the markets within which they operate; the adjustments made to normalize their earnings or design
comparable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 earnings; and the price appreciations experienced by each member since its conversion. Converting institutions
are almost always considered inferior to the peer group_a fact which raises questions about the composition of the
peer group. Little or no analytical evidence is typically given in appraisals for the discounts suggested for the
converting institution compared to the peer members. In addition, every appraisal contains a new issue discount
without any analytical support for exactly how much that discount should be or why it is needed. Our analysis indicates
market activity where virtually every conversion has traded up over the last few years. Finally, when subscription
offerings are completed and oversubscriptions have occurred (in some case, quite substantially) appraisers have
not justified why the original appraisal should not be increased beyond the ``supermax'' but rather in virtually
every case confirm the original valuation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many appraisals that the FDIC has reviewed contain only cursory analysis of the expected future earnings of the institution.
The FDIC believes that buyers of conversion stocks need to analyze institutions with much more financial sophistication
than what appears in the appraisal and, therefore, appraisals should be augmented. Earnings rarely reflect a true
expected use of conversion proceeds and others are understated by investments in low-rate securities. Earnings
are rarely estimated in conjunction with the converting institution's future business plan_a fact that the FDIC
finds inconsistent and unacceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the pendency of this rulemaking and subsequent to the adoption of a final rule, the FDIC will continue to review
appraisal reports to ensure that converting institutions and the conversion stock are properly valued. The FDIC
will continue to object to proposed conversions supported by unacceptable appraisal reports.

B. Depositor Voting Requirement and Prohibition on the Use of Running Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that, in order for a board of trustees of a mutual savings bank to properly exercise its fiduciary
responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board should obtain a vote of depositors in favor of the proposed
conversion before the proposed conversion is completed. Most states, but not all, require a depositor vote for mutual-to-stock
conversions. The OTS also requires both federal and state savings associations to obtain a majority vote of association
members as one of the pre-conditions to converting. Some states, however, require only that the board of trustees
(or similar group) approve the plan of conversion and do not require a vote of members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, several of the comments on the Interim Rule voiced opposition to ``voting rights'' for depositors
in states that do not provide such rights. In preliminary response to those comments, and subject to others that the
FDIC hopes to receive on this issue, the Board thinks that it is necessary and appropriate for the FDIC to require a depositor
vote on proposed conversions. Such a requirement would not necessarily contradict state laws (that do not require
a depositor vote), but supplement the state law by requiring the member vote. The FDIC's concern is with the board of
trustees' proper exercise of its fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the bank and its depositors. Preliminarily,
the Board believes that the proper exercise of such duties requires that depositors, as stakeholders of the bank,
have the opportunity to approve or disapprove the proposed conversion. This requirement is, in part, rooted in the
foregoing concern that bank insiders often benefit personally from bank conversions. This almost inherent conflict
of interest (between self interest and the interests of the bank) may be mitigated by the existence of a depositor vote
on the proposed conversion. The proposed rule, therefore, would require a depositor vote in favor of the proposed
conversion of a State Savings Bank to stock form. Unless otherwise prescribed by the applicable state law, the required
vote would be a majority of the bank's depositors and other stakeholders of the bank who the bank's trustees reasonably
determine are entitled to vote on the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the same vein, the Board believes that a proxy specifically designed for the proposed conversion should be used
to obtain a depositor vote on the conversion. In some states the management of converting banks and savings associations,
subject to certain conditions, may use so-called ``running proxies'' (proxies obtained when a depositor opened
his or her account with the institution) to vote in favor of the proposed conversion. The former OTS mutual-to-stock
conversion regulations also permitted the use of running proxies, under certain circumstances. Running proxies
are prohibited by the OTS Revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC believes, preliminarily, that given the material change in structure represented by the bank's conversion
to stock form, it is imperative that depositors be permitted to vote separately on the proposed conversion and that
the most effective manner to assure that depositors are fully informed of the proposed conversion and have an opportunity
to participate fully in the conversion would be to prohibit the use of running proxies in such transactions. This is
in keeping with the FDIC's concern that the management of a State Savings Bank fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities
by assuring that the depositors are in agreement with the proposed conversion. Thus, the proposed rule would prohibit
the use of running proxies in the mutual-to-stock conversion process.

C. Restrictions on Management Stock Benefit and Recognition Plans (MRPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS Revisions prohibit MRPs in conversions of federal and state savings associations. Currently, however, the
regulations and policies of some state banking and thrift regulators permit MRPs to purchase a certain percentage
of the stock sold in a mutual-to-stock conversion of a bank or savings association depending on the institution's
capital position. Under some of these regulations and guidelines, management also may be granted stock options up
to a certain percentage of the shares issued in the conversion. Based on a review of numerous proposed conversions,
the Board believes that some bank insiders may be sacrificing the interests of their institutions and depositors
in order to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits more advantageously than depositors.
Also, in some instances, the issuance of conversion stock to an MRP decreases the opportunity for depositors to obtain
conversion stock. Moreover, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than at the aftermarket
trading price, which in recent years has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates the impression
that insider enrichment may be the main reason for the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors reflect negatively on management's fulfillment of its fiduciary obligations. In fact, it may be an
inherent conflict of interest for management to decide to convert the bank to stock form when, as part of the proposed
conversion, management will reap significant benefits. Independent business judgment is essential to the proper
carrying out of a manager's obligations. This judgment may be severely clouded when MRPs are provided as part of the
conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, the FDIC received several comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule about
management compensation in the conversion process. Many of these comments argued that the management of converting
institutions should benefit from the conversion because such insiders are responsible for the bank's success and
will undertake additional and perhaps more difficult challenges upon the bank's conversion to stock form. The Board
does not disagree with this general point of view. While the Board believes that management and trustees would have
increased responsibilities as a public company, preliminarily, the Board believes that, in most cases, market-based
management compensation should be determined by the stockholders after the conversion is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the proposed rule would provide that no converted savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the
conversion, implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified
employee stock ownership plan, unless: each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion
stock offering materials; all such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently
formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following
the conversion; in the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by
a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no sooner than
the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; for stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower
than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and for management or employee stock benefit
plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed restrictions on MRPs do not include specific percentage limitations. Preliminarily, the FDIC believes
that the proposed restrictions would adequately safeguard against potential management self-interest in mutual-to-stock
conversions. Also, pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC would continue to look to MRP percentage limitations in
the OTS regulations, as well as in the applicable state law and regulations, as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed
conversions of State Savings Banks. In addition, the FDIC believes that specific percentage limitations on MRPs
may be too rigid and not serve to stem management abuses in every situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests specific comments on whether MRP percentage limitations should be specified in the FDIC's regulations
and, if so, what those percentages should be.

D. Eligibility Record Date, Priority to Depositors Residing in the Bank's Local Community, Priority of Employee
Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS Revisions require, among other things, that the record date established by a converting institution to determine
which depositors will be afforded a priority in obtaining subscription rights in the conversion stock be set at no
less than a year prior to the board of director's approval of the conversion. The Board believes, preliminarily, that,
in order for a board of trustees of a State Savings Bank to carry out its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank and its
depositors, the board must assure an equitable and lawful conversion process. From numerous comments we have received
thus far and from our own review of proposed and completed conversions, it is apparent that so-called professional
depositors, who place funds in mutual banks and savings associations throughout the country in order to gain a purchase
priority if the institution converts to stock form, have reaped substantial profits on conversions of mutual institutions.
A proper exercise of fiduciary responsibilities toward the bank and its longer-term depositors dictates that professional
depositors not be allowed to experience windfall gains in conversions. Requiring that the eligibility record date
be no less than one year prior to the board's adoption of the plan of conversion would help assure that longer-term depositors
are more likely than professional depositors to benefit from the stock purchase priority. Thus, the proposed rule
would require that the eligibility record date be no less than one year prior to the date the board of trustees approves
the plan of conversion. The FDIC requests specific comment on whether the one-year period is sufficient and on whether
the date chosen should be based on the board of trustees' first consideration of whether the bank should be converted
to the stock form of ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a further effort to mitigate the exploitation of the mutual-to-stock conversion process by professional depositors,
the proposed rule would provide a stock purchase preference to eligible depositors in the bank's ``local community''
or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting bank. The term ``local community'' would be defined
as all counties in which the converting bank has its home office or a branch office, each county's standard metropolitan
statistical area or the general metropolitan area of each of these counties and such other area(s) as provided for
in bank's plan of conversion. The Board believes that it is likely that the double requirement (for a stock purchase
priority) of having a depositor relationship with the bank for at least one year prior to the date of the board's adoption
of the plan of conversion and of having to reside in the bank's local community would decrease the participation of
professional depositors in conversions of State Savings Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is mindful, however, that there may be depositors, particularly long-term depositors, of a State Savings
Banks who are not ``professional depositors,'' but happen to live outside the ``local community'' or the 100-mile
area designated by the proposed requirement. Thus, the FDIC requests specific comment on whether and how such depositors
can be included within the proposed stock purchase preference for ``local depositors.'' One possible alternative
would be to expand the definition of ``local depositor'' to include all depositors who have had a deposit relationship
with the bank for, say, three or five years prior to the board of trustees' adoption of the plan of conversion. The Board
is interested in comments on all aspects of the proposed priority requirement for local depositors, including views
on whether the requirement is necessary, sufficient and/or equitable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the same vein, the Board believes that ESOPs (tax-qualified or otherwise) should not be accorded higher purchase
priority rights than long-term depositors. The Board believes that general principles of fiduciary duty require
that the board of trustees of a State Savings Bank put the interest of long-term depositors ahead of the interests of
management and employees. Thus, the proposed rule would require that ESOPs not be accorded a higher subscription
right priority than ``eligible depositors.'' The term ``eligible depositors'' would be defined as a depositor holding
qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year
prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of trustees. The FDIC requests
specific comment on whether the one-year period is sufficient and on whether the period chosen should be based on the
board of trustees' first consideration of whether to convert to stock ownership.

E. Submission of Business Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For safety and soundness purposes the FDIC must know the institution's business plan for post-conversion operation,
growth and investment of any newly injected capital. The reason is that institutions converting from mutual form
undertake a major restructuring that possibly could lead to significant changes in the nature or volume of business
conducted. Converted institutions become answerable to shareholders for the first time, and the shareholders are
concerned with obtaining a reasonable return on their investment. As discussed in the preamble to the Interim Rule,
in the past some institutions, in leveraging capital raised through a conversion and reaching for a return on equity,
have vigorously competed for loans and unduly liberalized underwriting standards. Such practices led to loan losses
that in many instances depleted more capital than was raised through conversion and, in some cases, failures and losses
to the Bank Insurance Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the proposed rule would require State Savings Banks that propose to undergo a mutual-to-stock
conversion to submit a business plan including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends
to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion, expected returns resulting from the plan,
and the justification for any intended stock repurchases.

F. Post-conversion Stock Repurchases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, the proposed rule would require that the business plan submitted to the FDIC in connection with
a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion include a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion
will be utilized, including, among other things, a justification for any proposed stock repurchases. The FDIC is
concerned that substantial buyback programs begun immediately after the bank's conversion to stock form may not
have a legitimate business purpose. Such repurchases also raise issues about whether the conversion stock was appropriately
valued. In addition, the FDIC is concerned that a recently converted institution have a capital base adequate to safeguard
against possible unexpected losses that may occur under the new organizational structure. To protect against these
potential problems, the proposed rule would prohibit stock repurchases for one year following the conversion. Stock
repurchases after that period would be considered on a case-by-case basis under section 18(i)(1) of the FDI Act (12
U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)) which prohibits state nonmember banks from reducing or retiring capital without the prior consent
of the FDIC.

VI. Merger/Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, mutual institutions convert to stock ownership in the course of a merger or acquisition transaction
with another depository institution or holding company. This is generally known as a merger/conversion. In merger/conversions
depositors of the converting institutions obtain the right to purchase stock in the acquiring institution and not
the converting savings bank. In exercising its fiduciary responsibilities the board of trustees of a State Savings
Bank must assure that value of the converting institution is fairly distributed. This means not only guarding the
interests of long-term depositors against insiders and professional depositors, but against acquiring institutions.
Based on the proposed conversions we have reviewed in the recent past and other merger conversions we have studied,
the Board has observed that, in virtually every merger conversion, the acquiring institution captures a large portion
of the value of the converting institution. It is also not uncommon in merger/conversions for the management of the
converting mutual institution to receive extremely generous compensation and benefit packages. The OTS Revisions
prohibit merger/conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the OTS Revisions, there is an issue whether the management of a mutual institution
is opting for a merger/conversion, instead of a standard conversion, based on the best interests of the institution
and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to management by the acquiring entity. As noted in
the preamble to the Interim Rule, there have been numerous complaints recently by depositors and others that permitting
healthy mutual savings banks to be acquired by means of a merger/conversion has resulted in some savings bank insiders
putting their interest ahead of the interests of the converting bank and its depositors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the foregoing reasons, the Board believes that merger/conversions should, in most cases, be permitted only in
situations where a State Savings Bank is ``undercapitalized,'' ``significantly undercapitalized'' or ``critically
undercapitalized'' as defined in the FDIC's capital maintenance regulations. At this time, however, the Board does
not propose to impose a blanket prohibition on non-supervisory merger/conversions. The FDIC will continue to review
proposed merger/conversions with an emphasis on whether the fair value of the State Savings Bank would be delivered
to the rightful recipients. The FDIC is requesting specific comment on this topic and specifically whether a moratorium
should be placed on merger/conversions involving sufficiently capitalized State Savings Banks.

VII. Comparison With OTS Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the requirements imposed by the proposed rule would essentially parallel the OTS Revisions. There
are numerous other provisions in the OTS' mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (12 CFR part 563b), however, that
are not included in either the FDIC Interim Rule or the proposed rule. Those OTS regulations impose upon converting
savings associations specific and detailed requirements on, among other things: items to be included in the plan
of conversion, stock purchase priorities, percentage limitations on stock purchases and MRPs, proxy solicitation
and the form and content of proxy statements, the form and content of offering circulars, accounting rules, liquidation
accounts, notices of filing, availability of conversion documents and pricing and sale of securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminarily, the FDIC believes that the requirements imposed by the proposed rule, coupled with the requirements
of the Interim Rule, would enable the FDIC to monitor the conversions of State Savings Banks for issues involving safety
and soundness, fiduciary duty and other violations of law. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC uses the OTS regulations
as a frame of reference in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC also looks
to the applicable state law and regulations in reviewing proposed conversions. To date, the FDIC has not identified
a need to adopt a more comprehensive set of regulations addressing all aspects of the mutual-to-stock conversion
process. It has been suggested, however, that in order to achieve greater uniformity with the OTS' conversion regulations
the FDIC's conversion regulations should be expanded to match the scope and depth of the OTS rules. Thus, the Board
specifically requests comment on whether the FDIC's regulations should be expanded to include provisions similar
to those of the OTS regulations that are not already included in either the Interim Rule or the proposed rule.

VIII. Convenience and Needs Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has issued a proposed rule that would add a requirement to its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations that,
in determining whether to approve such a conversion transaction, the OTS would consider the convenience and needs
of the community served by the converting institution. 59 FR 22764 (May 3, 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``convenience and needs of the community to be served'' by the applicant is one of the statutory factors required
to be considered by the Board in acting on applications for deposit insurance (12 U.S.C. 1816). Thus, in connection
with the review of mutual holding company reorganizations of insured depository institutions the FDIC already is
required to (and does) apply a convenience and needs test. The Board requests comment on whether the FDIC could and
should also consider imposing such a requirement in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings
Banks.

IX. Summary of Comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC received 85 written comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Final Rule: 60 from banks, savings
banks, cooperative bank and saving associations; 7 from bank and thrift industry trade groups; 6 from state banking
and thrift regulators; 5 from individuals; 5 from law firms; 1 from a bank holding company; and 1 from a regulatory ``shadow''
group.

1. FDIC Oversight Role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments did not focus on describing recent abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions. They generally acknowledged
that there had been notable examples of insider abuse in the recent past and then suggested how future potential abuses
could be avoided. Many of those who commented recommended that the FDIC play an oversight role in the mutual-to-stock
conversions of State Savings Banks. One state stock savings bank that is owned by a mutual holding company noted that
``present abuses in several recent and proposed conversions have demonstrated the need for the FDIC to maintain oversight
of the conversion process, to ensure that issues of both safety and soundness and of fiduciary care are identified
and adequately addressed.'' One state savings association trade group commented that ``with recent publicity over
some apparent abuses in the [conversion] process and resulting Congressional concerns, *&blank;*&blank;* it is
most appropriate and important for the FDIC to assert regulatory jurisdiction over conversions by state nonmember
banks.'' One state thrift regulator noted that the FDIC had issued an ``excellent set of rules'' with a ``very conservative,
realistic approach to a situation which could have gotten out of hand if left to go unchecked.'' One State Savings Bank
said simply that ``past abuses [in mutual-to-stock conversions] support the need for FDIC oversight.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the FDIC have oversight authority of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock conversions,
but with prescribed limitations. For example, a national banking industry trade group noted that it ``deplores instances
in which it can be demonstrated that insiders involved in mutual-to-stock conversions received benefits so large
that they bear no reasonable relationship to the institution's performance *&blank;*&blank;* Unjustifiable windfall
profits, depletion of capital without concern for safety and soundness and manipulation of the value of the institution
to benefit limited interests are practices that deserve close scrutiny and action by the appropriate authorities
*&blank;*&blank;* In responding to these issues, the FDIC should act quickly and decisively in concert with the state
authorities.'' The trade group further commented that the ``cornerstone'' for the FDIC's response to issues arising
from the mutual-to-stock conversion issue is the state regulatory authorities. One state thrift regulator expressed
support for FDIC oversight of conversions if such involvement assures ``reasonableness and relative uniformity
of benefits for both state- and OTS-regulated institutions *&blank;*&blank;* and allows state variation from OTS
requirements if such variations benefit the institution and the depositors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One mutual savings bank noted that the FDIC should focus on broad safety-and-soundness issues and that detailed regulations,
like the OTS', are not necessary. Another state mutual savings bank said that the FDIC should be involved in conversion
oversight, but only in terms of setting minimum standards rather than superseding state regulation. Many savings
banks in Massachusetts and a banking trade association in that state commented that the FDIC should issue conversion
regulations similar to the OTS and Massachusetts mutual-to-stock conversion regulations, noting that the FDIC
has broad statutory authority to regulate issues that affect safety and soundness. They noted that the FDIC's focus
should be to eliminate abuses in stock evaluation, depositor disclosures, depositors' ability to purchase stock
at conversion and insider compensation programs. They also asserted that state statutory and regulatory conversion
rules should not be superseded by federal law. One mutual savings bank noted that promulgating federal laws or regulations
``should not be allowed when it is determined that state requirements are generally consistent or more stringent
than existing federal rules.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters contended that state regulation was sufficient in the area of mutual-to-stock conversions and that
the Interim Rule is not necessary. One mutual savings bank asserted that the ``averments made by the FDIC in support
of the Interim Rule that it is needed for safety and soundness reasons and to protect the interest of depositors are
without merit and are being offered only to support continued federal intrusion into issues which are primarily the
concern of state law and regulation.'' One state mutual savings bank stated that the ``proposed policy statement
is overkill'' and that ``state regulation can handle insider abuse issues.'' One state banking and thrift regulator
asserted that state regulators are not to blame for insider abuses in conversions and that ``states' rights should
not be tramped on.'' The regulator suggested that a committee of state and federal regulators work together to address
issues and concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All those who commented on the issue expressed objection to Congressional legislation to address current issues
in mutual-to-stock conversions. One mutual savings bank commented that ``if the FDIC does not act, Congress will_in
an uninformed manner.'' Another mutual savings bank noted that ``regulation is far preferable than legislation.''
A national banking industry trade group noted that the ``FDIC has full statutory authority in the conversion area
to ensure the integrity of the conversion process and no new legislation is necessary to address these issues.''

2. Transferable Subscription Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC received many comments on the issue whether conversion rules should be modified to require converting institutions
to provide depositors with transferable subscription rights to purchase the stock issued in the mutual-to-stock
conversion. This issue was not addressed in either the Proposed Policy Statement or the Interim Rule. In recent Congressional
testimony the FDIC Chairman has indicated that the FDIC may consider whether depositors and other stakeholders of
converting institutions should receive transferable subscription rights so they can participate more equitably
in the conversion process and receive benefits from the conversion without having to purchase conversion stock to
do so. With one exception, all the comments received on this issue opposed the idea. One mutual savings bank stated
that ``we are outraged that any governmental body would consider provisions such as depositor subscription rights
that could enable speculators to force a mutual bank to convert to a stock bank. Such a provision would not just endanger
this bank, but destroy it, along with many other community institutions.'' A national banking industry trade group
echoed these sentiments, noting that ``permitting or requiring transferable subscription rights would undermine
the integrity of conversions by generating intense pressures to convert mutuals to stock form. All mutuals would
be put into play.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many mutual savings and cooperative banks in Massachusetts expressed their objection to ``mandatory depository
transferable/saleable subscription rights'' noting that ``they could subject our depositors to professional
flippers [out-of-area depositors who are just interested in short-term investment gains], attorneys and investment
firms who may bring pressure to force a mutual-to-stock conversion.'' A shadow regulatory group expressed the opposite
view, arguing that subscription rights should be transferable to provide an incentive for depositors to exercise
their subscription rights.

3. Contributions to the Community/FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of those who commented on the issue expressed opposition to requiring converting institutions to contribute
part of the conversion proceeds directly to their communities. Many noted such a requirement would impose a ``social
tax'' on converting institutions. A state savings bank stated that ``a capital giveaway wouldn't further the FDIC's
legitimate goal of preserving safety and soundness.'' Another state savings bank noted that such a ``social tax would
jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank and would negatively affect credit availability to local consumers
and small businesses. These are not public funds.'' One of the numerous savings banks in Massachusetts who commented
negatively on this issue asserted that ``a social tax would replace insider greed with a form of outsider greed.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters, however, suggested that the FDIC should share in conversion proceeds. A regulatory ``shadow''
group stated that the FDIC should receive at least 50 percent of [the transferable subscription] rights [issued in
a mutual-to-stock conversion], which it would sell in the market. The group argued that: ``the taxpayer, through
the FDIC, has the strongest claim on the existing surplus of converting mutual institutions. The taxpayer has taken
the risk of loss that is usually borne by the stockholder. The public, that had to pay for the loss of failed thrifts,
should reap some of the benefits that all usually go to the stockholder.'' A state bank commented that ``windfall appreciation
from stock conversions should accrue to the FDIC. The FDIC has provided protection for thrifts over the years and deserves
the benefit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Merger/Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual who commented on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule stated that merger/conversions should
not be allowed because they ``only serve management's interests and not the depositors.'' He suggested that any merger
take place only after an initial ``free-standing'' standard conversion. A bank holding company commented that merger/conversions
are desirable because they increase competition in the industry and support safety and soundness. It noted that state
law is the ``proper authority'' to regulate management compensation issues in merger/conversions. A law firm commented
that the problems with merger/conversions could be ``reduced substantially if the OTS revised its policy to encourage
a discount in the acquirors' stock as offered to depositors of the acquired institution.'' A state banking and thrift
regulator suggested that the FDIC and OTS collaborate in a joint determination on whether merger/conversions will
be approved in the future and, if so, adopt specific requirements to provide parity among savings associations and
savings banks. A state banking and thrift industry trade group recommended that merger/conversions be permitted
only in the case of undercapitalized institutions or at the discretion of the regulators on a case-by-case basis.
A national banking and thrift industry trade group said it would not oppose a ``regulatory pause by the FDIC to evaluate
its rules governing merger/conversions.''

5. Depositor Voting/Running Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the FDIC should not provide ``voting rights'' to depositors in connection with conversions
of mutual savings banks in states that do not provide such voting rights. One state bank asserted that ``voting rights
should be left to state law. To impose some sort of depositor approval requirement in a state that does not have depositor
voting could lead to expanded ownership claims by depositors that could operate to the detriment of mutuals.'' One
state banking and thrift regulator (of a state that does not provide a depositor voting right) asserted that ``any
FDIC requirement of a depositor vote in a mutual-to-stock conversion *&blank;*&blank;* [would be] wholly unsupported
by any expressly preemptive federal statute.'' Many banks in Massachusetts commented that any depositor voting
right requirements imposed by the FDIC would put undue pressure on mutuals in that state to convert to stock ownership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual noted that general proxies should be prohibited and that all conversions should be subject to a special
proxy, or proxies should be entirely eliminated in favor of a majority-rules scheme. A national banking and thrift
industry trade group noted that the use of general proxies is reasonable under the OTS' rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. Management Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters discussed the issue of management benefits in conversions. Several of them stated that insiders
should share in the benefits of conversions because the insiders managed the institution in a safe-and-sound manner.
One state thrift regulator (and other commenters) suggested that MRPs be based on the size of the institution and not
on ``straight across-the-board percentages.'' One national banking and thrift industry trade group noted that
``avoiding the use of across-the-board percentages for MRPs and tailoring their availability more to the size of
the institution and their specific business plan objectives and needs would be a reasonable approach.'' One mutual
savings bank noted that MRPs, stock option plans and employee stock ownership plans ``all encourage more stock ownership
and cement an identity among outside shareholders and those who run and work for the company.'' It also noted that OTS
rules are workable in this regard and should be adopted by the FDIC. Another savings association commented that conversions
should not be permitted where there is excessive compensation for insiders, but ``without benefits to insiders there
will be no conversions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual commented that the FDIC should not regulate director remuneration in conversions of healthy mutuals
because those conversions do not place the insurance fund at risk and shareholders' votes are dispositive under the
``corporate waste'' doctrine. A law firm, commenting on behalf of a state thrift industry trade group, also noted
that compensation benefits are not a safety-and-soundness concern if the institution meets the applicable capital
requirements. In addition, it stated that a ``uniformity of benefits between state- and OTS-regulated conversions''
is necessary to assure the end of ``regulatory arbitrage.'' A state bank and thrift regulator (and several other commenters)
suggested that the FDIC and OTS publish joint MRP guidelines permitting or prohibiting MRPs, along with specific
rules therefore. It noted that ``proper resolution of the MRP issue will have a substantial impact on fairness to depositors
in conversions.'' One savings bank commented that ``when an institution contemplates going public for the right
reasons (expansion, market share, competitive advantage) the benefits should go to those willing to risk their careers
(board and management team) or their capital (shareholders) not to the faceless non-entity group known as the existing
depositors.''

7. Appraisals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A state savings association noted that one of the basic problems with conversions is the appraisal of the institution.
It stated that ``the FDIC needs to be satisfied that the various states are as well equipped [as the ``qualified'' OTS
staff] to perform a definitive analysis of institution appraisals as well as know with certainty that the appraiser
is qualified to assess a financial institution's value.'' The commenter also noted that fairness and moderation
are the keys to governing stock conversions. An individual commented that the FDIC should not regulate the offer price
for healthy mutuals because those conversions do not place the insurance fund at risk. An individual suggested that
the applicable regulator should retain its own appraiser to assure fair valuation of the converting entity. A state
bank and thrift regulator stated that appraisal rules required by the FDIC should be specifically stated in the Interim
Rule.

8. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney commented that the Interim Rule should allow depositors full access to all papers filed in connection
with proposed merger/conversions, as well as standard conversions. He also suggested that depositors be permitted
to file with the FDIC objections to such proposed transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted that the FDIC should clarify that the Interim Rule applies to mutual holding company formations
and merger/conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual suggested that, to protect the insurance fund, a converting institution should prepare a business
plan regarding the proposed use of the new capital. The plan should be reviewed by the applicable state; however, if
the FDIC feels state review will be insufficient, the FDIC is empowered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act)
to assume jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two law firms suggested that the FDIC's review time on conversion notices be reduced from 60 days to 45 days because
of the potential that financial information might become ``stale'' under rules issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the converting institution would have to go through the expense of producing updated financial statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section applies to the conversion of insured mutual state savings banks to the stock form of ownership. It supplements
the procedural and other requirements for such conversions in &sect;303.15 of this chapter. This section also applies,
to the extent appropriate, to the reorganization of insured mutual state savings banks to the mutual holding company
form of ownership. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, this section does not
apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings banks whose capital category under &sect;325.103
of this chapter is ``undercapitalized,'' ``significantly undercapitalized'' or ``critically undercapitalized.''
The Board of Directors of the FDIC may grant a waiver in writing from any requirement of this section for good cause shown.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the event that an insured mutual state savings bank that proposes to convert to the stock form of ownership finds
that compliance with any provision of this section would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state law,
the bank may file a written request for waiver of compliance with such provision by the FDIC. In making such request,
the bank shall demonstrate that the requested waiver, if granted, would not result in any effects that would be detrimental
to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail a breach of fiduciary duty on part of the bank's management or otherwise
be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors, any other insured depository institution(s), the federal
deposit insurance funds or to the public interest.

In addition to other requirements that may be imposed by the applicable state statutes and regulations and other federal
statutes and regulations, including &sect;303.15 of this chapter, an insured mutual state savings bank shall not
convert to the stock form of ownership unless the following requirements are satisfied: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The subscription offering of the stock to be offered or sold in the conversion shall provide a stock purchase priority
to eligible depositors, other depositors and others entitled to vote on the bank's proposed conversion residing
in the bank's local community or within 100 miles of a home office or branch of the converting bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Employee stock ownership plans shall not have priority over subscription rights of eligible depositors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any direct community offering by the converting bank shall give a purchase priority to natural persons residing
in the bank's local community or within 100 miles of a home office or branch of the bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed conversion shall be approved by a vote of at least a majority of the bank's depositors and other stakeholders
of the bank who the bank's trustees reasonably determine are entitled to vote on the conversion, unless the applicable
state law requires a higher percentage, in which case the higher percentage shall be used. Voting may be in person or
by proxy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Management shall not use proxies executed outside the context of the proposed conversion to satisfy the voting
requirement imposed in paragraph (d)(4) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In addition to the materials to be submitted to the FDIC pursuant to &sect;303.15(c) of this chapter, the bank must
submit to the FDIC: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and the pricing of the stock to be sold in the conversion.
The report must be prepared by an independent appraiser and must include a complete and detailed description of the
elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for
the conclusions reached therein, including a full discussion of the applicability of each peer group member and documented
analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below) the institution proposing to convert may have from
the peer group statistics and a complete analysis of the institution's

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 13, 1992, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor &amp; Environmental Resources; Division of
Environmental Protection; Office of Air Quality (WVOAQ) submitted a request to EPA to redesignate the Charleston
moderate ozone nonattainment area (Kanawha and Putnam Counties) from nonattainment to attainment. On November
13, 1992, the WVOAQ also submitted a maintenance plan for the Charleston area as a revision to the West Virginia State
Implementation Plan (SIP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1994 submittal. The EPA is proposing to
redesignate the Charleston ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and proposing to approve
the maintenance plan submitted by the WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because the relevant requirements
set forth in the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, have been met. This proposal to approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignation is contingent upon West Virginia's submittal of a revision to its maintenance plan's provisions for
implementation of contingency measures. These actions are being taken in accordance with the Act. The approved maintenance
plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Charleston area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure
to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures
to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. (1977 Act, sections 110(a)(1) and 172.) The Charleston, West
Virginia nonattainment area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the
ozone NAAQS on September 12, 1978. (40 CFR 81.347) In accordance with section 110 of the 1977 Act, West Virginia submitted
a part D ozone SIP on November 15, 1979 which EPA approved as meeting the requirements of section 110 and part D of the
1977 Act. In its SIP, the State of West Virginia projected that the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area would
attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. The area failed to attain the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (hereafter the Act) were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549,
104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The nonattainment designation of the Charleston, West Virginia
area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, furthermore, it was classified
by operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) of the Act. See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and
57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area more recently has attained the ozone NAAQS, based on air quality
data from 1989 through 1991. In an effort to comply with the Act and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November
13, 1992 the WVOAQ submitted an ozone maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area as a revision to the West
Virginia SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia also requested that EPA redesignate the Charleston, West Virginia
area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. In addition, on February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update
to its November 13, 1992 submittal, collectively referred to hereafter as the ``State of West Virginia's redesignation
request.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act, five specific requirements must be met in order for EPA to redesignate
an area from nonattainment to attainment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 175A of the Act.

III. Review of West Virginia's Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of West Virginia's redesignation request for the Charleston, West Virginia area included information
and documentation sufficient for EPA to determine that the five requirements of section 107, noted above have been
met. Following is a brief description of how each of these requirements has been fulfilled. Because the maintenance
plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under
its analysis of the redesignation request. A Technical Support Document (TSD) has also been prepared by EPA on these
rulemaking actions. That TSD is available for public inspection at the EPA Regional Office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 section of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The submittal contains an analysis of ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation
request. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1989 through 1991 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Charleston,
West Virginia area. See 40 CFR &sect;50.9 and appendix H. The State of West Virginia's request for redesignation included
documentation that the Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area has complete, quality-assured data
showing attainment of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period. Therefore, the Charleston,
West Virginia area has met the first statutory criterion for redesignation to attainment of the ozone NAAQS found
at section 107(d)(3)(E)(i) of the Act. It is important to note that EPA has also reviewed the ozone data monitored during
the 1992 and 1993 ozone seasons in the Charleston area and determined that no violations of the standard were monitored
during those years. Therefore, there have been no violations of the ozone standard monitored in the Charleston area
since the 1988 ozone season.

2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously stated, EPA fully approved the State of West Virginia SIP for the Charleston, West Virginia area as meeting
the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act. The amended Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2)
and, under Part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes
of redesignation, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the Act as of November
13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia submitted its redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.A. Section 110 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 110 of the 1977 Act was amended in 1990, the Charleston, West Virginia SIP meets the requirements
of section 110(a)(2) of the amended Act. A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA
believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, See 57 FR
27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. EPA has analyzed the SIP and
determined that it is consistent with the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the Act. It contains enforceable emission
limitations, it requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data, it requires preconstruction
review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones, it provides for adequate funding,
staff, and associated resources necessary to implement its requirements, and requires stationary source emissions
monitoring and reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.B. Part D Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have
fulfilled applicable requirements of part D due as of the date of the State's redesignation request. Under part D,
an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the
basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable.
Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section
181(a). The Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area was classified as moderate. (See 56 FR 56694, codified
at 40 CFR 81.347). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, West Virginia must meet the applicable requirements
of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176_as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of
part D_due as of the date of the State's November 13, 1992 request for redesignation. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v)
to mean that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject
area prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come
due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation
of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.B.1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable no later than 3 years after an area has been designated
as nonattainment under the Act. EPA has determined that these requirements were not applicable to ozone nonattainment
areas on or before November 13, 1992_the date the State of West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request
and maintenance plan for Charleston. Therefore, the State of West Virginia is not required to meet these requirements
for purposes of redesignation. West Virginia has, however, completed and submitted a 1990 base year emissions inventory
for its ozone nonattainment areas (including the Charleston area) in accordance with EPA's guidance. It is also important
to note that upon redesignation to attainment, the preconstruction new source review requirements for prevention
of significant deterioration (PSD) would apply in the Charleston area. EPA approved West Virginia's PSD SIP program
on April 11, 1986 (51 FR 12517).

2.B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed
States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity
regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation
and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan
approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to &sect;51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and &sect;51.851
of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation
conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly,
West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent
with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not
yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval
of this redesignation request.

2.B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of
section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 13, 1992, the date West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request
for the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area, the Charleston, West Virginia area was required to meet the
provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements
in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections
as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A final rule approving these RACT corrections was published on September 17,
1992 (57 FR 42895).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed
to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for its ozone
nonattainment areas. On January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that
West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% rate of progress plan SIP revision for its ozone nonattainment areas. Upon
the effective date of a final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request, these findings will be automatically
rescinded in the Charleston nonattainment area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has
a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as
discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the 1977 Act, EPA approved the State of West Virginia SIP control strategy for the Charleston, West Virginia
nonattainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. EPA determined that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable.
Since enactment of the 1990 amendments, the State of West Virginia submitted corrections to its RACT regulations
as identified above. EPA finds that these additional measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of
reductions in ambient ozone levels in the Charleston, West Virginia area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between 1988 and 1990, because of permanent and enforceable state and federal provisions, emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) were reduced by 8.14 tons/day and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) were reduced by 3.1 tons/day in Charleston. Most of the reductions came from mobile sources and gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing-related activities. The Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), of gasoline marketed for use in the Charleston, West
Virginia area decreased from 10.5 RVP to 9.5 RVP in 1990 and was reduced to 9.0 in 1992. In addition, due to automobile
fleet turnover, there was an increase in the percent of automobiles operated in the Charleston area meeting more stringent
emission standards as required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). It must be noted here that since
1992 the federal RVP requirement of 9.0 has been the applicable standard in the Charleston, West Virginia area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of West Virginia maintenance plan requires the continuation of the federal RVP program. These reductions
due to lower RVP and more stringent tailpipe standards resulting from the FMVCP were determined using the mobile emission
inventory model MOBILE 5.0a and the relevant vehicle miles traveled data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permanent and enforceable decreases in VOCs at stationary sources contributed a small amount to the total VOC reduction
in the Charleston, West Virginia area. In association with its emission inventory, the State of West Virginia demonstrated
that point source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn during the period in which
the Charleston, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
West Virginia area's ambient air quality came into attainment. Reductions due to decreases in production levels
or from other unenforceable scenarios such as voluntary reductions were not included in the determination of the
emission reductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that the combination of measures contained in the SIP and federal measures have resulted in permanent and
enforceable reductions in ozone precursors that have allowed the Charleston West Virginia area to attain the NAAQS,
and therefore, that the redesignation criterion of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) has been met.

5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing approval of the State of West Virginia maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area because
EPA finds that West Virginia's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. If EPA determines after
notice and comment that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment
area will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the area is redesignated. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which
demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.

5.A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from area, stationary, and mobile using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance.
The 1990 VOC inventory is considered most representative of attainment conditions because no violations occurred
in 1990 and it reflects the typical inventory for the three-year period demonstrating attainment of the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia submittal contains detailed inventory data and summaries by source categories. The State
of West Virginia submittal also contains information related to how it comported with EPA's guidance, which model
and emission factors were used (note MOBILE 5.0a was used), how Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) data was generated,
what RVP was considered in the base year, and other technical information verifying the validity of the Charleston
West Virginia emission inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia's submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by source category. This
inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidances. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year
inventories are shown in the following six tables. The TSD which has been prepared for this action contains more in-depth
details regarding the base year for the Charleston area.

5.B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the continued use of lower RVP gasoline (9.0) and fleet turnover to automobiles meeting more stringent
emission standards, mobile source emission projections are dependent upon the implementation of the federal reformulated
gasoline program. Total VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to year 2005. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance
with EPA guidance. The projections demonstrate that the ozone standard will be maintained i.e., emissions are not
expected to exceed the level of the base year inventory during this time period. EPA believes that the emissions projections
demonstrate that the area will continue to maintain the ozone NAAQS because this area achieved attainment through
VOC controls and reductions.

5C. Verification of Continued Attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Charleston, West Virginia area depends, in part, on the State of West
Virginia efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State of
West Virginia will track the status and effectiveness of the maintenance plan by periodically updating the emissions
inventory every three years. The WVOAQ has committed to perform this tracking on an annual basis in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the State of West Virginia to implement the contingency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of its maintenance plan as expeditiously as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia annual update will indicate new source growth, as indicated by annual emission statements.
The State of West Virginia will continue to monitor ambient ozone levels by operating its ambient ozone air quality
monitoring network in accordance with 40 CFR part 58.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the Charleston area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS in the
future. Despite the State of West Virginia's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the
Charleston area may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, West Virginia has provided contingency measures with
a schedule for implementation in the event of future ozone air quality problems. In the event that exceedances of the
ozone NAAQS are measured such that nonattainment is indicated in any of the areas or in the event that periodic emission
inventory updates or major permitting activity reveals that excessive or unanticipated growth in ozone precursor
emissions has occurred or will occur, the West Virginia will accordingly select and adopt measures including the
following to assure continued attainment:

 RACT requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Regulations to establish plant-wide emission caps (potentially with emissions trading provisions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Implementation of basic (or enhanced) programs for motor vehicle inspection and maintenance.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One or more of these regulatory revisions would be selected within three (3) months after verification of a monitored
ozone standard violation and a draft rule submitted to the WVOAQ. Quality assurance procedures must confirm the monitored
violation within 45 days of occurrence. The WVOAQ will be requested to adopt the control measure(s) as emergency rule(s)
which will be implemented within six (6) months after adoption. EPA's approval of West Virginia's redesignation
request is contingent upon West Virginia promulgating a revision to its contingency plan that includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule for the mandatory implementation of the selected contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State of West Virginia has agreed to submit a revised maintenance
SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an
additional ten years. EPA has determined that the maintenance plan adopted by the State of West Virginia and submitted
to EPA on November 13, 1992, meets the requirements of section 175A of the CAA. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve
the maintenance plan submittal. In addition EPA has determined that upon final approval of the maintenance plan the
provisions of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) for redesignation will have been met.

Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to approve the ozone maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area submitted by the State of
West Virginia on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because it meets the requirements of section
175A. In addition, EPA is proposing to redesignate the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area to attainment,
subject to final approval of the maintenance plan, because the Agency has determined that the provisions of section
107(d)(3)(E) of the Act for redesignation of nonattainment areas to attainment have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will be
considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the person and address listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section at the beginning of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Ozone State
Implementation Plans (SIPs) are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act and to provide for
attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Today's proposed redesignation action should not be interpreted
as authorizing the State of West Virginia to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC emission limitations and restrictions
contained in the currently approved ozone SIP. Changes to the ozone SIP's regulations rendering them less stringent
than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions,
and changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
173(b) of the Act and in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant to section 110(k)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter
I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have any economic impact
on any small entities. Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act does not impose
any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area
and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. Accordingly, I certify that EPA's approval of West Virginia's
request to redesignate the Charleston ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the associated maintenance plan
will not have an impact on any small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA), Subtitle I_Regulation of Underground Storage Tanks, 42 U.S.C. 6901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., to limit the regulatory obligations of persons maintaining indicia of ownership in a petroleum underground storage
tank (UST) or UST system primarily to protect a security interest. The rule is proposed in response to petitions received
by the Agency in connection with the rulemaking related to lender liability under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing conditions under which certain security interest holders may be exempted from the RCRA Subtitle
I corrective action, technical, and financial responsibility regulatory requirements that apply to an UST owner
and operator. (See 40 CFR part 280.)

EPA is proposing to establish regulatory criteria specifying which RCRA Subtitle I requirements are applicable
to a secured creditor. Section 9003(h)(9) of RCRA exempts from the definition of ``owner,'' for purposes of section
9003(h)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 those persons who, without participating in the management of the UST or UST system, and who are not otherwise engaged
in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, maintain indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system primarily
to protect a security interest. Those most affected by this ``security interest exemption'' include private lending
institutions or other persons that guarantee loans secured by real estate containing an UST or UST system, or that
acquire title to, or other indicia of ownership in, a contaminated UST or UST system.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 However, the security interest exemption is not limited solely to lending institutions; it potentially applies
to any person whose indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system is maintained primarily to protect a security interest.

The RCRA subtitle I security interest exemption not only affects secured creditors but also UST and UST system owners
who seek capital through the private lending market. Today's proposed rule will provide a regulatory exemption from
corrective action regulatory requirements for those persons who provide secured financing to UST and UST system
owners. EPA expects this rule, in conjunction with the statutory exemption in section section 9003(h)(9), to encourage
the extension of credit to credit-worthy UST owners. At present, EPA believes that concerns over environmental liability
are making a significant number of lenders reluctant to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy owners and operators
of USTs. The free flow of credit to UST owners (many of whom are small entities that may rely on secured financing mechanisms
for capital) is expected to assist UST owners in meeting their obligations to upgrade, maintain, or otherwise comply
with RCRA subtitle I and other environmental requirements. Conversely, the lack of such capital may adversely affect
the ability of an UST owner to meet its obligations under Subtitle I, with concomitant adverse environmental impacts
from USTs and UST systems that are out of compliance due to the lack of financing for the UST owner and operator. (For
a more detailed discussion, please refer to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Background Document
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for this proposed rule, located in the OUST Docket at 401 M Street, SW., room 2616, Washington, DC 20460.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also concerned that if otherwise credit-worthy UST owners and operators are unable to obtain financing
to perform leak detection tests, or to upgrade or replace deficient tanks, the market for UST equipment could be adversely
affected, thereby limiting the availability and/or affecting the cost of such equipment. In addition, a lack of adequate
capital could produce a ripple effect which would cut across other portions of the UST-related industrial sector.
Based on letters received from UST equipment manufacturers, EPA believes that this sector has suffered as a direct
result of the capital squeeze on UST owners and operators. The Agency is further concerned that many UST equipment
manufacturers may find it increasingly difficult to sustain their production of UST equipment. Unnecessary constrictions
on the free flow of capital for UST compliance and improvements could force companies to abandon their production
of UST equipment or to close altogether, and it may have adverse impacts on the environment by making the investment
or development of new UST technological innovations more difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to this proposed rule is structured as follows: The following section briefly describes the UST program.
This section is followed by a discussion of this proposed rule, which includes a description of the various options
lenders may exercise both pre- and post-foreclosure with respect to regulatory compliance for a secured UST or UST
system. Proposed regulatory text concludes this proposed rule.

II. Description of the UST Regulatory Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the Agency's study of the banking community's lending practices and discussions with representatives of
both lenders and borrowers, EPA believes that the lending community in general is not particularly familiar with
the UST statutory scheme and regulatory program. Because UST and UST systems are likely to be used as collateral in
securing loans to borrowers, the Agency believes that it is appropriate and useful to briefly describe the UST program
in the preamble of this proposed rule. The following discussion is general in nature and is intended to provide a framework
for lenders or others to better understand the scope and intent of the program; it is not intended to be a substitute
for the regulations themselves.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, Congress responded to the increasing threat to groundwater
posed by leaking underground storage tanks by adding subtitle I to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Subtitle
I required EPA to develop a comprehensive regulatory program for USTs storing petroleum or hazardous substances.
Congress directed the Agency to publish regulations that would require owners and operators of new tanks and tanks
already in the ground to prevent and detect leaks, cleanup leaks, and demonstrate that they are financially capable
of cleaning up leaks and compensating third parties for resulting damages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's UST regulations, 40 CFR parts 280 and 281, apply to any person who owns or operates an UST or UST system. The term
``owner'' is defined in the statute generally to mean any person who owns an UST used for the storage, use, or dispensing
of substances regulated under subtitle I of RCRA (which includes both petroleum and hazardous substances) (section
9001(3), 42 U.S.C. 6991(3)). Owners are responsible for complying with the ``technical requirements,'' ``financial
responsibility requirements,'' and ``corrective action requirements'' specified in the statute and regulations.
These requirements are intended to ensure that USTs are managed and maintained safely, so that they will not leak or
otherwise cause harm to human health and the environment. In addition, should a leak occur, the requirements provide
that the owner is responsible for addressing the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These same requirements apply to any person who ``operates'' an UST system. The term ``operator'' is very broad and
means ``any person in control of, or having responsibility for, the daily operation of the underground storage tank''
(section 9001(4), 42 U.S.C. 6991(4)). As with owners, there may be more than one operator of a tank at a given time. Each
owner and operator has obligations under the statute and regulations. In this respect, it is important to understand
that a person may have obligations under subtitle I either as an owner or as an operator, or both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following subsections describe briefly each of the major components of the UST regulatory program applicable
to persons who own or operate USTs and UST systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. UST Technical Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The technical standards of 40 CFR part 280 referred to here include: Subpart B_UST systems: Design, Construction,
Installation, and Notification (including performance standards for new UST systems, upgrading of existing UST
systems, and notification requirements); Subpart C_General Operating Requirements (including spill and overfill
control, corrosion protection, reporting and recordkeeping); Subpart D_Release Detection; &sect;280.50 (reporting
of suspected releases) of Subpart E_Release Reporting, Investigation, and Confirmation; and Subpart G_Out of Service
UST Systems (including temporary and permanent closure). These regulations impose obligations upon UST owners
and operators, separate from the subtitle I corrective action requirements discussed in Section II. B of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Leak Prevention
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before EPA regulations were issued, most tanks were constructed of bare steel and were not equipped with release prevention
or detection features. 40 CFR 280.21 requires UST owners and operators to ensure that their tanks are protected against
corrosion and equipped with devices that prevent spills and overfills no later than December 22, 1998. Tanks installed
before December 22, 1988 must be replaced or upgraded by fitting them with corrosion protection and spill and overfill
prevention devices to bring them up to new-tank standards. USTs installed after December 22, 1988 must be fiberglass-reinforced
plastic, corrosion-protected steel, a composite of these materials, or determined by the implementing agency to
be no less protective of human health and the environment and must be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance
with a code of practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory. Piping
installed after December 22, 1988 generally must be protected against corrosion in accordance with a national code
of practice. All owners and operators must also ensure that releases due to spilling or overfilling do not occur during
product transfer and that all steel systems with corrosion protection are maintained, inspected, and tested in accordance
with &sect;280.31.

2. Leak Detection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to meeting the leak prevention requirements, owners and operators of USTs must use a method listed in &sect;&sect;280.43
through 280.44 for detecting leaks from portions of both tanks and piping that routinely contain product. Deadlines
for compliance with the leak detection requirements have been phased in based on the tank's age: The oldest tanks,
which are most likely to leak, had the earliest compliance deadlines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Release Reporting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UST owners and operators must, in accordance with &sect;280.50, report to the implementing agency within 24 hours,
or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, the discovery of any released regulated
UST substances, or any suspected release. Unusual operating conditions or monitoring results indicating a release
must also be reported to the implementing agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Closure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators who would like to take tanks out of operation must either temporarily or permanently close them
in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart G_Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure. When UST systems are temporarily
closed, owners and operators must continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection and, unless all USTs
have been emptied, release detection. If temporarily closed for three months or more, the UST system's vent lines
must be left open and functioning, and all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment must be capped and
secured. After 12 months, tanks that do not meet either the performance standards for new UST systems or the upgrading
requirements (excluding spill and overfill device requirements) must be permanently closed, unless a site assessment
is performed by the owner or operator and an extension is obtained from the implementing agency. To close a tank permanently,
an owner or operator generally must: Notify the regulatory authority 30 days before closing (or another reasonable
time period determined by the implementing agency); determine if the tank has leaked and, if so, take appropriate
notification and corrective action; empty and clean the UST; and either remove the UST from the ground or leave it in
the ground filled with an inert, solid material.

5. Notification, Reporting, and Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UST owners who bring an UST system into use after May 8, 1986 must notify state or local authorities of the existence
of the UST and certify compliance with certain technical and other requirements, as specified in &sect;280.22. Owners
and operators must also notify the implementing agency at least 30 days (or another reasonable time period determined
by the implementing agency) prior to the permanent closure of an UST. In addition, owners and operators must keep records
of testing results for the cathodic protection system, if one is used; leak detection performance and upkeep; repairs;
and site assessment results at permanent closure (which must be kept for at least three years).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Corrective Action Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners and operators of UST systems containing petroleum or hazardous substances must investigate, confirm, and
respond to confirmed releases, as specified in &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67. These requirements include,
where appropriate: Performing a release investigation when a release is suspected or to determine if the UST system
is the source of an off-site impact (investigation and confirmation steps include conducting tests to determine
if a leak exists in the UST or UST system and conducting a site check if tests indicate that a leak does not exist but contamination
is present); notifying the appropriate agencies of the release within a specified period of time; taking immediate
action to prevent any further release (such as removing product from the UST system); containing and immediately
cleaning up spills or overfills; monitoring and preventing the spread of contamination into the soil and/or groundwater;
assembling detailed information about the site and the nature of the release; removing free product to the maximum
extent practicable; investigating soil and groundwater contamination; and, in some cases, outlining and implementing
a detailed corrective action plan for remediation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Financial Responsibility Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial responsibility regulations (40 CFR part 280, subpart H) require that UST owners or operators demonstrate
the ability to pay the costs of corrective action and to compensate third parties for injuries or damages resulting
from the release of petroleum from USTs. The regulations require all owners or operators of petroleum USTs to maintain
an annual aggregate of financial assurance of $1 million or $2 million, depending on the number of USTs owned. Financial
assurance options available to owners and operators include: Purchasing commercial environmental impairment
liability insurance; demonstrating self-insurance; obtaining guarantees, surety bonds, or letters of credit;
placing the required amount into a trust fund administered by a third party; or relying on coverage provided by a state
assurance fund.

D. State Program Approval Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subtitle I of RCRA allows state UST programs approved by EPA to operate in lieu of the federal program. EPA's state program
approval regulations under 40 CFR part 281 set standards for state programs to meet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Scope of the UST Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain types or classes of tanks that are exempt from all or part of subtitle I's requirements. Specifically
excluded by statute are: Farm and residential tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for
noncommercial purposes; tanks used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where stored; tanks
stored on or above the floor of underground areas (such as basements or tunnels); septic tanks; systems for collecting
stormwater or wastewater; flow-through process tanks; emergency spill and overfill tanks that are expeditiously
emptied after use; and tanks holding 110 gallons or less (42 U.S.C. 6991(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, and of particular importance to today's proposal, the statute excludes one type of potential ``owner''
from the corrective action requirements applicable to owners. Specifically, the statute excludes from the definition
of owner any person ``who, without participating in the management of an UST, and otherwise not engaged in petroleum
production, refining, and marketing, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect the owner's security interest
in the tank'' (RCRA section 9003(h)(9), 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h)(9)). This statutory provision is intended to exempt from
cleanup responsibility a person whose only connection with a tank is as the holder of a security interest; i.e., a bank
or other secured creditor who has extended credit to a borrower (commonly the tank's owner) and who has in return secured
the loan or other obligation by taking a security interest in the tank. EPA has promulgated regulations governing
corrective action under subtitle I. (See 40 CFR part 280, &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67.) The regulation proposed
today addresses the requirements of subtitle I that are applicable to a person who holds a security interest in a tank
(a ``security holder'' or merely ``holder'') from the time that the person extends the credit up through and including
foreclosure and re-sale. As described in this proposed rule, a holder may face obligations either as an owner or as
an operator, depending upon the specific activities undertaken by the holder.

III. The UST Security Interest Exemption and Intent of Today's Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The security interest exemption under subtitle I, section 9003(h)(9) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h)(9), provides:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in this subsection, the term ``owner'' does not include any person who, without participating in the management
of an underground storage tank and otherwise not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, holds
indicia of ownership primarily to protect the owner's security interest in the tank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Limited legislative history exists concerning the RCRA subtitle I security interest exemption. No guidance or other
indication is available concerning the types of activities that Congress considered to be consistent with the subtitle
I security interest exemption, or about the types of activities that Congress considered to be impermissible participation
in an UST or UST system's management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory exemption is limited to liability for corrective action at petroleum-contaminated sites. Since the
subtitle I security interest exemption applies only to the corrective action requirements for petroleum_Part 280
Subpart F and portions of subpart E, one interpretation of the statute could hold that the holder is not exempt from
complying with other portions of the statute and regulations applicable to an ``owner'' of a tank. These other parts
include 40 CFR part 280, subparts B, C, D, E (&sect;280.50 only), and G (hereafter referred to as the ``UST technical
standards'' for purposes of this rule), and Subpart H_Financial Responsibility. However, the statute is silent
with respect to a holder's liability for these requirements solely as a consequence of having ownership rights in
a tank primarily to protect a security interest. The Agency does not believe that these limited ownership rights rise
to the level of full ``ownership'' sufficient to make the holder an ``owner'' of the tank, as that term is used in section
9001(3) of RCRA subtitle I. Therefore, EPA is proposing, under its broad rulemaking authority in section 9003, that
a holder who meets the criteria specified in this proposed rule (i.e., whose only connection with the tank is as the
bona fide holder of a security interest in the UST or UST system) is not subject to the UST technical standards and financial
responsibility requirements otherwise applicable to a tank owner. EPA believes that this is both appropriate under
the Agency's rulemaking authority and consistent with Congressional intent in providing the section 9003(h)(9)
exemption for those persons who provide only financing to owners of a tank. Accordingly, a qualifying holder will
not be required to comply with the full panoply of EPA regulations implementing subtitle I that apply to tank owners
prior to or following foreclosure, provided that the requirements of today's proposed rule are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to a holder's potential to be an ``operator'' of a tank prior to foreclosure, consistent with the provisions
of this proposed rule, the holder typically will not be involved in the day-to-day operations of the tank, and will
therefore not incur liability as an ``operator.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By foreclosing, however, the holder takes affirmative action with respect to the tank and displaces the borrower;
therefore, by necessity, the holder has taken ``control of .&blank;.&blank;. [and] responsibility for .&blank;.&blank;.''
the tank, and is therefore a tank operator under the definition at 42 U.S.C. 6991(4). However, under today's proposed
rule, a foreclosing holder's responsibility for corrective action as an operator is limited in certain circumstances:
In general, a holder's obligations would be limited under the provisions of this rule where the foreclosed-on tank
is no longer storing petroleum, or where the holder itself empties the tank within a certain time period. In these circumstances,
while a holder is an operator and therefore subject to the UST program's technical requirements and other obligations,
a holder may remain exempt from the corrective action requirements and satisfy the technical requirements by exercising
one of the options for compliance described in Section III. D. 2 of this preamble. These options allow a holder to satisfy
its regulatory obligations as an ``operator'' by undertaking specified minimally burdensome and environmentally
protective actions to secure and protect the UST or UST system. On the other hand, a holder who operates a tank by, for
example, storing or dispensing product following foreclosure will be subject to the full range of requirements applicable
to any person operating a tank (including corrective action requirements).

Of course, a lender which has control of or responsibility for the daily operation of a tank would be an ``operator''
under section 9001(4), and therefore subject to all requirements applicable to an operator of a tank, including corrective
action. Similarly, such acts may also constitute ``participation in the management'' of the tank, which would void
the section 9003(h)(9) exemption and obligate the lender to comply with these same technical, financial, and corrective
action requirements as an owner.

In developing today's proposal, EPA examined the potential obligations under subtitle I of government entities
that act as conservators or receivers of assets acquired from failed lending and depository institutions, such as
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Where a government entity
or its designee is acting as a conservator or receiver, EPA interprets the security interest exemption in RCRA subtitle
I section 9003(h)(9) to preclude the imposition of the insolvent estate's liabilities against the government entity
acting as the conservator or receiver, and considers the liabilities of the institution being administered to be
limited to the institution's assets. The situation of a conservator or receiver of a failed or insolvent lending institution
is analogous to that of a trustee (particularly a trustee in bankruptcy) that is administering an insolvent's estate
and, in accordance with those principles, the insolvent's liabilities are to be satisfied from the estate being administered
and not from the assets of the conservator or receiver. Therefore, satisfaction of an estate's debts or liabilities
would not reach the general assets of the FDIC, the RTC, those of any other government entity acting in a similar capacity,
or those of a private person acting on behalf of the government conservator or receiver.

the provisions of RCRA subtitle I at issue in this proposal. Section 9003(b), 42 U.S.C. 6991b(b) provides EPA with
authority to ``promulgate release detection, prevention, and correction regulations applicable to all owners
and operators of underground storage tanks, as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to define the regulatory terms under which a secured creditor may, consistent with the statutory
exemption, avoid responsibility for corrective action as an owner and operator of an underground storage tank, as
well as proposing an exemption from certain financial responsibility requirements. As discussed elsewhere in this
preamble (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section III.D), the statutory exemption from corrective action liability addresses only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
owners
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of underground storage tanks, while the statute and EPA's implementing regulations extend liability to both owners
and operators. The Agency believes that without promulgating a rule under EPA's broad grant of rulemaking authority
applying the protection found in the statutory security interest exemption to operators as well as owners, the statutory
exemption may be rendered virtually meaningless, since an owner of an UST is also typically an UST operator. EPA does
not believe that Congress, in creating section 9003(h)(9), intended for an otherwise exempt holder of a security
interest to nonetheless fall subject to corrective action obligations as an operator. As such, EPA's exercise of
its rulemaking authority in the proposed rule is appropriate and, perhaps, needed to fully effectuate the purpose
of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency has explicit rulemaking authority to, in its discretion, exempt certain classes of owners
and operators from corrective action obligations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 holders of security interests as described in this proposal). Section 9003(b) permits the Agency, in promulgating
regulations under subtitle I, to make distinctions in its UST regulations between types or classes of tanks, based
upon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``the technical capability of the owners and operators.'' Because security interest holders are typically not as
a general matter engaged in the operation and maintenance of USTs (and thus do not possess the technical capacity of
most UST owners and operators), EPA does not believe that requiring them to comply with highly detailed technical
requirements is appropriate where requiring them to do so is not necessary for protection of human health and the environment.
Furthermore, the Agency believes an exemption from these regulatory requirements is appropriate in the context
of this proposed rule, where an exemption will serve, albeit indirectly, to advance the goals of subtitle I by making
credit more available and thus aiding in the implementation of tank upgrade requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this authority is not open-ended, as section 9003(a) requires EPA to promulgate regulations that are protective
of human health and the environment. Without compromising the level of protectiveness established by the UST program,
EPA previously relied on its section 9003(b) authority when it excluded a group of owners and operators from RCRA subtitle
I requirements in the final Financial Responsibility Rule (53 FR 43322, Oct. 26, 1988). (In relevant part, the preamble
to the final Financial Responsibility Rule states: ``The Agency does not interpret the Congressional intent of subtitle
I to preclude exempting any class of USTs from otherwise applicable requirements when the Agency has determined that
such requirements are not necessary to protect human health or the environment.'') That rule exempted states and
the federal government from the UST financial responsibility requirements since those entities were, as a class,
able to satisfy the purpose of the financial responsibility requirements in the absence of regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, for purposes of this proposal, EPA believes that it is reasonable, in light of the purposes behind this
proposal, to exempt a holder from RCRA subtitle I corrective action requirements as an operator if its USTs are empty
and secure (as would be required under today's proposal) or if the holder chooses to also engage in environmentally
beneficial activities (as discussed in Section III. E of this preamble). Because of the requirements a holder must
meet before enjoying this proposed exemption, EPA's UST regulations will satisfy the statutory requirement that
they be protective of human health and the environment.

The following sections describe the key terms used in this proposed rule. For the most part, these are also terms used

requirements.

``Production of petroleum'' includes, but is not limited to, activities involved in the production of crude oil or
other forms of petroleum, as well as the production of petroleum products from purchased materials, either domestically
or abroad. ``Refining'' includes the processes of cracking, distillation, separation, conversion, upgrading,
and finishing of refined petroleum or petroleum products. ``Marketing'' includes the distribution, transfer,
or sale of petroleum or petroleum products for wholesale or retail purposes. A holder who stores petroleum products
in USTs for on-site consumption only, such as to provide heat to an office building or to refuel its own vehicles, is
not considered to be engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing for the purposes of the UST regulatory
program.

2. Indicia of Ownership
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that ``indicia of ownership'' means ownership or evidence of an ownership interest in a petroleum
UST or UST system. EPA is not proposing to limit or qualify type, quality, or quantity of ownership indicia that may
be held by a person for the purpose of the regulatory exemption. The nature of the ownership interest may vary according
to the type of secured transaction and the nature of the holder's relationship (such as that of a guarantor or surety).
Accordingly, indicia of ownership may be evidence of any ownership interest or right to an UST or UST system, such as
a security interest, an interest in a security interest, or any other interest in an UST or UST system. For purposes
of this proposed rule, examples of such indicia include, but are not limited to, a mortgage, deed of trust, or legal
or equitable title obtained pursuant to foreclosure or its equivalents, a surety bond, guarantee of an obligation,
or an assignment, lien, pledge, or other right to or form of encumbrance against an UST or UST system. Accordingly,
it is not necessary for a person to hold actual title or a security interest in order to maintain some indicia or evidence
of ownership in an UST or UST system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Primarily To Protect a Security Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that the term ``primarily to protect a security interest'' as used in this proposed regulation means
a holder's indicia of ownership are held primarily for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation.
EPA intends this phrase to require that the ownership interest be maintained primarily for the purpose of, or primarily
in connection with, securing payment or performance of a loan or other obligation (a security interest), and not an
interest in the UST or UST system held for some other reason.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A security interest may arise pursuant to a variety of statutory or common law financing transactions. While a security
interest is ordinarily created by mutual consent, such as a secured transaction within the scope of Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, there are other means by which a security interest may be created, some of which may or may
not be the result of a consensual arrangement between the parties to the transaction. In general, a transaction that
gives rise to a security interest within the ambit of this proposed rule is one that provides the holder with recourse
against an UST or UST system of the person pledging the security; the purpose of the interest is to secure the repayment
of money, the performance of a duty, or of some other obligation.

Restatement of Security
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1941).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a matter of general law, security interests may arise from transactions in which an interest in an UST or UST system
is created or established for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation, and includes mortgages, deeds of
trust, liens, and title held pursuant to lease financing transactions. Security interests may also arise from transactions
such as sale-and-leasebacks, conditional sales, installment sales, trust receipt transactions, certain assignments,
factoring agreements or accounts receivable financing agreements, consignments, among others, provided that
the transaction creates or establishes an interest in an UST or UST system for the purpose of securing a loan or other
obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, ``indicia of ownership'' held ``primarily to protect [a] security interest'' do not include evidence
of interests in the nature of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
investment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the UST or UST system, or an ownership interest held primarily for any reason other than as protection for a security
interest. The person holding ownership indicia to protect a security interest may have additional, secondary reasons
for maintaining the indicia in addition to protecting a security interest; maintaining indicia for reasons in addition
to protecting a security interest may be consistent with the exemption and this proposed rule. However, any such additional
reasons must be secondary to protecting a security interest in the secured UST or UST system. EPA recognizes that lending
institutions have revenue interests in the loan transactions that create security interests; such revenue interests
are not considered to be investment interests, but are considered secured transactions falling within the proposed
security interest regulatory exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. ``Holder'' of Ownership Indicia
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``holder'' as used in this proposed regulation is a person who maintains ownership indicia primarily to protect
a security interest, however acquired or held. The term ``holder'' includes the initial holder (such as the loan originator)
and any subsequent holder, such as a successor-in-interest, subsequent purchaser on the secondary market, loan
guarantor, surety, or other person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest.
The term also includes any person acting on behalf of or for the benefit of the holder, such as a court-appointed receiver
or a holder's agent, employee, or representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it should be noted that lending institutions, which typically hold a large number of security interests,
may also act in some trustee, fiduciary, or other capacity with respect to an UST or UST system. However, this rule does
not address circumstances in which a lending institution or any person acts as a trustee, or in a non-lending capacity,
or has any interest in an UST or UST system other than as provided in this rule. Because this proposed regulation, as
well as the exemption in section 9003(h)(9), addresses only persons who maintain a ``security interest,'' any discussion
of persons with other interests or involvement in an UST or UST system is beyond the scope of this proposed rule. Of course,
a trustee or other fiduciary with respect to an UST or UST system (or any person who independent of the status as trustee
or fiduciary) who holds indicia of ownership in the UST or UST system primarily to protect a security interest may fall
within this proposed security interest regulatory exemption.

5. Participating in Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes that, as used in this proposed rule, ``participation in the management of an UST or UST system'' means
the actual involvement in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the UST or UST system by the holder.
Participation in management does not include the mere capacity or unexercised right or ability to influence UST or
UST system operations. This proposal contains a list of activities that is not all-inclusive, but which generally
describes activities that are not considered to be evidence that a holder is participating in the management of an
UST or UST system. In addition, to address those other activities not specifically listed, a general test of management
participation is proposed. The general test specifies that a holder is considered to be participating in management,
within the scope of this proposed regulatory exemption, when it exercises decisionmaking control over the borrower's
UST or UST system, or where the holder assumes overall management responsibility encompassing decisionmaking authority
over the enterprise that includes day-to-day operation of the UST or UST system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, activities that are evidence that a holder is participating in the management of an UST or
UST system, and thus acting outside the scope of this proposed regulatory exemption, include: Exercising management
control or decisionmaking authority over operational aspects of an UST or UST system, or securing a lease agreement,
contractual arrangement, or employee relationship with any other person to manage or operate the UST or UST system.
Such activities indicate that a holder is involved in or exercising decisionmaking control of operations of the UST
or UST system in which the holder has a security interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this proposed rule, a holder performing the functions of a plant manager, operations manager, chief
operating officer, chief executive officer, and the like, of the facility or business at which the UST is located is
considered to be exercising management control or decisionmaking authority over the operational aspects of the
UST or UST system and therefore, participating in management, unless the responsibilities for the position specifically
exclude all UST responsibilities. Control over the operational aspects of management should not be confused, however,
with those activities which constitute administrative or financial management or involvement in non-operational
activities. Such activities may be engaged in by a holder in the course of managing a loan portfolio and do not exceed
the boundaries of the security interest exemption. Such activities may include providing financial or other assistance,
environmental investigations or monitoring of the borrower's business and collateral, engaging in ``loan work
out'' activities, foreclosing on a secured UST or UST system, winding down operations following foreclosure or its
equivalents, or divesting itself of the foreclosed-on property containing an UST or UST system. These, as well as
other actions related to a holder's financial and administrative obligations, are discussed in more detail in the
following section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Test of Management Participation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is not possible to specifically cover in this proposed rule or any regulation every conceivable situation in which
a holder might act, or to make specific provisions for every action that a holder might undertake that might make it
ineligible for the protection of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption, voiding the security interest
exemption. A general test or standard of participation in an UST or UST system's management has therefore been formulated
to provide a framework within which to assess the consistency of a holder's actions with the limitations of the proposed
regulatory exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal's two-prong test or standard of management participation provides that while the borrower is still
in possession of an UST or UST system (i.e., pre-foreclosure), a holder participates in the management of an UST or
UST system only where the holder either exercises decisionmaking control over the UST or UST system, or where the holder's
actions manifest or assume responsibility for the overall management of the UST or UST system's day-to-day operations.
The general test adopts a functional approach which focuses on the holder's actual decisionmaking involvement in
the operational (as opposed to the financial or administrative) affairs of the borrower's UST or UST system. The first
prong looks to whether the holder has exercised decisionmaking control over the borrower's environmental compliance.
If so, the holder is ``participating in the management'' of the UST or UST system as defined in the proposed rule. Similarly,
the second prong looks to where the holder is functioning as the overall manager by exercising management at a level
encompassing the borrower's environmental obligations, or over all or substantially all of the operational aspects
of the borrower's enterprise, regardless of whether decisionmaking control over compliance with the regulations
governing the UST or UST system has been explicitly assumed or not. This level of actual involvement in the management
of the UST or UST system is sufficient to constitute management participation for purposes of this proposed regulatory
exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the first prong of the general test, a holder cannot remain within the scope of the exemption if it controls the
borrower's environmental compliance activities associated with the UST or UST system. Under the second prong of
the general test, the ability to carve out environmental compliance responsibilities from other operational aspects
of the borrower's business or enterprise demonstrates that the holder has manifested or assumed operational responsibility
at a management level that includes environmental matters, and in doing so is considered to be participating in the
UST or UST system's management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, management participation does not include the unexercised right to become involved in operational UST
or UST system decisionmaking. In other words, if the holder does not exercise its rights to participate in the management
of the UST or UST system, it still may qualify for the security interest exemption. Whether the exercise of rights that
a holder might have_whether under contract or other agreement (if any) or otherwise, including the enforcement of
loan terms and covenants or other rights_rises to the level of participation in the UST or UST system's management
is measured by reference to the general test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Actions that are not participation in management
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Participation in the following activities will not exclusively, in themselves, exceed the bounds of this proposed
regulatory exemption: Policing the loan, undertaking financial work out with a borrower where the obligation is
in default or in threat of default, undertaking foreclosing and winding up operations (as described later in this
proposal), or preparing the UST or UST system for sale or liquidation. In addition, the holder is not considered to
be participating in the management of the UST or UST system by monitoring the borrower's business; by requiring or
conducting on-site investigations, including site assessments, inspections, and audits, of the environmental
condition of the UST or UST system or the borrower's financial condition; by monitoring other aspects of the UST or
UST system considered relevant or necessary by the holder; by requiring certification of financial information
or compliance with applicable duties, laws, or regulations, or by requiring other similar actions, provided that
the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or operation of the UST or UST system, as provided in this
proposed regulation. Such oversight and obligations of compliance imposed by the holder are not considered part
of the management of an UST or UST system. Although such requirements and oversight may inform and perhaps strongly
influence the borrower's management of an UST or UST system, the holder is not considered to be participating in management
where the borrower continues to make operational decisions concerning the UST or UST system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protected activities of a holder that are specifically identified in this rule are consistent with the language
of RCRA section 9003(h)(9) and the overall purpose of subtitle I. Judicial decisions construing the substantially
similar language of CERCLA section 101(20)(A) have addressed the issue of the appropriate degree of a holder's involvement
at a facility in which it held a security interest (i.e., the standard of ``participation in management''). Although
the cases articulated the CERCLA standard using different language, these cases generally held that the exemption
is abrogated once a holder has divested the borrower or debtor of its management authority prior to foreclosure, such
as when the holder becomes involved in the facility's day-to-day operations, where it becomes overly entangled in

While the cases listed above describe particular activities and draw a line between the actions of a holder that are
and are not evidence of management participation for purposes of CERCLA, there remains uncertainty about the effect
of activities commonly or routinely undertaken by a holder in the course of managing a loan secured by an UST or UST system.
EPA believes that the uncertainty created for holders examining their potential for liability under CERCLA also
exist when holders assess their potential obligations under RCRA subtitle I. Therefore, this proposed rule is intended
to specify the compliance obligations for lenders when conducting normal business activities and to define with
greater precision the point at which a holder's actions pass from loan oversight and advice to actual UST or UST system
management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections discuss and describe the specific activities of a holder that the proposed rule defines as
either activities that indicate the holder's participation in the management of an UST or UST system or those that
are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 instances of participation in the management of an UST or UST system by a person holding indicia of ownership primarily
to protect a security interest in the UST or UST system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It bears repeating, however, that the activities identified in this proposed rule do not specify the only activities
that may be undertaken by a holder without losing the protection of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption,
and one should not infer that activities not specifically mentioned in this rule are automatically considered evidence
of participation in an UST or UST system's management_those must be addressed on a case-by-case basis based on the
general test provided in this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Actions undertaken by a holder prior to the inception of a transaction in which indicia of ownership are held primarily
to protect a security interest are irrelevant with respect to the general test of participation in management, and
thus are not considered evidence of participation in the management of the UST or UST system. Thus, consultation and
negotiation concerning the structure and terms of the loan or other obligation, the payment of interest, the payment
period, and specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling, guidance, or other actions
at or prior to the time that indicia of ownership are first held are not considered evidence of participation in the
management of the UST or UST system for purposes of this proposed rule. Activities that take place

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to such pre-loan involvement, a holder may determine (whether for risk management or any other business
purpose) to undertake or require an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection,
and/or audit) of an UST or UST system securing the loan or other obligation. Such environmental investigation may
be undertaken by the holder, for example, or the holder may require one to be conducted by another party (such as the
borrower) as a condition of the loan or other transaction. Neither RCRA Subtitle I nor this proposed rule require that
such an environmental investigation be undertaken to qualify for the security interest exemption, and the obligations
of a holder seeking to avail itself of the exemption cannot be based on or affected by the holder's not conducting or
not requiring an environmental investigation in connection with the security interest. Similarly, a holder is not
engaged in management participation solely as a result of undertaking or requiring an environmental investigation,
and nothing in this proposed rule should be understood to discourage a holder from undertaking or requiring such an
environmental investigation in circumstances deemed appropriate by the holder. Because lender-conducted or -required
investigations of a borrower's business or collateral are information-gathering in nature, such activities cannot,
alone, be considered to be management participation by a holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that a pre-loan environmental investigation of a UST or UST system reveals contamination, the holder
may undertake any one of a variety of responses that it deems appropriate: For example, the holder may refuse to extend
credit or to follow through with the transaction or instead maintain indicia of ownership in other, non-contaminated
property as protection for the security interest. Alternatively, a holder may determine that the risk of default
is sufficiently slight (or that the extent of contamination is minimal and does not significantly affect the value
of the UST or UST system as collateral) to proceed to extend credit and maintain indicia of ownership in the UST or UST
system. Additionally, the holder may require the borrower to clean up the contamination as a condition for extending
the loan. Such activities are not considered participation in the UST or UST system's management, and a holder that
knowingly takes a security interest in contaminated collateral is not subject to compliance with the RCRA Subtitle
I corrective action regulatory program solely on this basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policing the security interest or loan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holder may undertake actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security
interest which include, but are not limited to, a requirement that the borrower clean up a release from the UST or UST
system which may have occurred prior to or during the life of the loan or security interest (as described in the last
section); a requirement of assurance of the borrower's compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental
or other laws and regulations during the life of the loan or security interest; securing authority or permission for
the holder to periodically or regularly monitor or inspect the UST or UST system in which the holder possesses indicia
of ownership, or the borrower's business or financial condition, or both; or to comply with legal requirements to
which the holder is subject; or other requirements or conditions by which the holder is able to police adequately the
loan or security interest, provided that the exercise by the holder of such other loan policing activities are not
considered evidence of management participation as provided in the proposed rule's ``general test'' of management
participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority for the holder to take such actions may be contained in contractual (e.g., loan) documents or other relevant
documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental, and other warranties, covenants, and representations
or promises from the borrower. While the regulatory exemption in this proposed rule requires that the actions undertaken
by a holder in overseeing or managing the loan or other obligation be consistent with those of a person whose indicia
of ownership in an UST or UST system is held primarily to protect a security interest, a holder is not expected to be an
insurer or guarantor of environmental safety or quality at a secured UST or UST system. The inclusion of environmental
warranties and covenants is not considered to be evidence of a holder's acting as an insurer or guarantor, and a finding
of ``management participation'' cannot be premised solely on the existence of such terms or upon the holder's actions
that ensure that the UST or UST system is managed in an environmentally sound manner. Since these actions are consistent
with holding indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest, they are not considered to be participation
in management in this proposed rule.

Loan work out.

 The holder may determine that actions need to be taken with respect to the UST or UST system to safeguard the security
interest from loss. These actions may be necessary when, for example, a loan is in default or threat of default, and
are commonly referred to as ``loan work out'' activities. ``Loan work out'' is largely an undefined term but is generally
understood in the financial community to mean those activities undertaken to prevent, mitigate, or cure a default
by the obligor or to preserve or prevent the diminution of the value of the security. Loan work out activities are recognized
by EPA as a common lender undertaking and, as such, these actions will not take a holder outside of the scope of the security
interest exemption provided for in this proposed rule, provided that such actions are consistent with the proposed
general test of management participation.

When the holder undertakes loan work out activities, provides financial or other advice, or similar support to a financially

only so long as the holder does not participate in management as provided by this proposed rule's general test. Loan
work out actions that are not evidence of ``participation in management'' include, but are not limited to: Restructuring
or renegotiating the terms of the security interest; requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising
forbearance with regard to the security interest; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an assignment of accounts
or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow agreement pertaining to
amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling,

Foreclosure and sale or liquidation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreclosure and possession of property for purposes of sale or liquidation are often the only remedy the holder may
have to secure performance of an obligation. The process of foreclosure and sale or liquidation of a foreclosed-on
UST or UST system often results in the exclusive possession of the UST or UST system by the holder and may require or result
in the holder's taking record title to the UST or UST system under the laws of some states. For purposes of this proposed
rule, the term ``foreclosure or its equivalents'' includes foreclosure, purchase at foreclosure sale, acquisition
or assignment of title in lieu of foreclosure, acquisition of a right to possession or title, or other agreement in
settlement of the loan obligation, or any other formal or informal manner by which the holder acquires possession
of the borrower's collateral for subsequent disposition in partial or full satisfaction of the underlying obligation.
These actions are considered to fall within the scope of the proposed regulatory exemption as necessary incidents
to holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest. However, a holder is under the coverage of
the proposed rule and is not considered an ``owner'' of a UST or UST system only so long as the holder's acquisition pursuant
to foreclosure is reasonably necessary to ensure satisfaction or performance of the obligation, is temporary in
nature, and occurs while the holder is actively seeking to sell or otherwise divest the foreclosed-on UST or UST system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet the requirements of the proposed rule's exemption from regulatory compliance as an ``owner'' following foreclosure,
a holder must be acting consistently with the security interest exemption's requirement that the ownership indicia
maintained by the holder continue to be held primarily to protect the security interest. Where a holder's actions
indicate that it is not seeking to sell or liquidate the secured assets, the exemption is voided because such actions
are akin to holding the asset for investment purposes. This proposed regulation describes circumstances under which
a holder may avoid being considered an ``owner'' of property on which it forecloses for purposes of certain Subtitle
I regulations. It is only by complying with the provisions of this proposed rule that the limited ownership rights
of a security holder do not rise to the level of full ``ownership'' sufficient to make the security holder an ``owner''
of the tank, as that term is used in EPA's UST regulations. The proposed rule first provides a set of general criteria
for offering an UST or UST system for sale, and when and under what circumstances an offer of purchase may or may not be
rejected. In addition, even though a holder is permitted to use whatever means are appropriate and available to sell
or otherwise divest itself of foreclosed-on property, as a measure of certainty this proposed rule contains an objective
test that, if followed by a holder, establishes that the holder is meeting the general obligation to divest itself
of a foreclosed-on UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner. EPA believes that this aspect of the proposed
rule is consistent with the RCRA Subtitle I security interest exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, under this proposal, a foreclosing holder must, in order to maintain consistency with the security interest
exemption, seek to sell or otherwise divest itself of foreclosed-on property in a reasonably expeditious manner
using whatever commercially reasonable means are available or appropriate, taking all facts and circumstances
into account. A holder cannot, under the terms of the proposed rule, reject or refuse offers for the property that represent
fair consideration for the asset and remain within the proposed regulatory exemption. A holder that outbids or refuses
offers from parties offering fair consideration for the property establishes that the property is no longer being
held primarily to protect a security interest. The terms of the bid are relevant for this purpose, and a holder is not
required to accept offers that would require it to breach duties owed to other holders, the borrower, or other persons
with interests in the property that are owed a legal duty. In addition, the term ``fair consideration'' refers to an
all cash offer, which is intended to ensure that this proposed rule would not require a holder to accept a bid that contains
unacceptable conditions, such as requirements for indemnification agreements, non-cash offers, ``bundled''
offers, etc. This proposed provision should not be read to require that a holder may accept only cash offers, however;
a holder is always free to accept any offer satisfactory to the holder. The exact requirement that would be imposed
by this proposed regulation is that a holder may not reject a cash offer of fair consideration for the foreclosed-on
property. If it does, or if it outbids others offering fair consideration, then the holder would, under today's proposal,
be considered to be an owner of the UST or UST system in the same manner as any other purchaser.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule's provisions defining ``fair consideration'' and specifying when the foreclosing holder may
reject or outbid offers for the property are formulated to reflect the amount that the holder may bid at the foreclosure
sale, or not reject during the foreclosure sale or thereafter, in order to recover on its loan or other obligation.
In addition, there may be multiple security interests in a borrower's property held by secured creditors, which the
definition of ``fair consideration'' must account for. Therefore, for a senior creditor, the term ``fair consideration''
is proposed to mean a cash amount that represents a value equal to or greater than the outstanding obligation owed to
the holder (including the fees, penalties, and other charges incurred by the holder in connection with the property).
``Fair consideration'' is further proposed to indicate that the amount that will recover the holder's ``security
interest'' in the property may vary depending on the seniority of the loan or other obligation that is being foreclosed
upon. Specifically, a junior creditor may be required to outbid senior creditors in order to recover the value of its
loan or other obligation. The definition of fair consideration therefore distinguishes between what junior or senior
creditors may bid or not reject for purposes of maintaining the exemption. In addition, in order to avoid liability
under law (for example, to the borrower), the foreclosing holder may be required to seek an amount at the foreclosure
sale that is greater than the outstanding obligation owed to the foreclosing holder, or to sell the property in a different
manner; therefore, the proposed rule does not require a holder to accept an offer of ``fair consideration'' if to do
so would subject the holder to liability under federal or state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this way the proposed rule's provisions with respect to the sale or disposition of property will not conflict with
the manner in which such sales are required to be conducted under general principles of law applicable to the holder
and the disposition of the property including the UST. For purposes of this proposed rule, the definition of ``fair
consideration'' is an objective, ``bright-line'' test to determine whether the foreclosing holder has an investment
or other interest in the property that is not within the exemption, or whether the holder's post-foreclosure activities
indicate that it continues to maintain its ownership indicia in the property primarily to protect a security interest,
and is therefore within the protective ambit of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While a holder may use whatever means are reasonable and appropriate for marketing foreclosed-on property to establish
that it is seeking to divest itself of property in an expeditious manner, this proposed rule also provides a mechanism
by which a holder can definitely establish that it continues to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security
interest and is not an ``owner,'' for purposes of complying with the UST regulatory program, of foreclosed-on property.
This mechanism is intended to act as another ``bright line'' to provide clear and unambiguous evidence that a holder
is not the UST or UST system's ``owner'' following foreclosure: A holder choosing to avail itself of this bright line
test must, within 12 months following the acquisition of marketable title, list the property with a broker, dealer,
or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or advertise the property as being for sale or disposition
on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the property
in question, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable
under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil
procedure) covering the area where the property is located. If the holder satisfies these criteria, the holder is
considered to have complied with the requirement in the proposed rule that it is seeking to sell or otherwise divest
the property in an expeditious manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also recognizes that market conditions, the condition of the property, and other factors may mean that despite
reasonable efforts to expeditiously sell or divest foreclosed-on property, the property may not be quickly sold.
Therefore, this regulation does not impose a time requirement for the ultimate disposition of foreclosed-on property.
Provided that the property is being actively offered for sale by the holder and no offers of fair consideration are
ignored, outbid, or rejected, foreclosed-on property may continue to be held by the holder without the holder being
considered an ``owner'' of the UST or UST system for purposes of complying with the UST regulatory program, as detailed
in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the manner in which the foreclosing holder chooses to market the property, if at any time after six months
following the acquisition of marketable title the holder rejects, or does not act upon within 90 days of receipt of,
a written, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
firm offer of fair consideration for the property, the holder will lose the protection of the proposed rule. Under
this proposal, a ``written, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
firm offer'' is a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, offer, including all material terms of the transaction,
from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. Where
a holder outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration, the holder is considered, for the purpose
of the proposed regulatory exemption, to be maintaining its indicia of ownership in the property as protection for
investment purposes, and not as security for the obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed exemption from regulatory compliance would also permit a foreclosing holder to undertake actions with
respect to the UST or UST system to protect or preserve the value of the secured asset. For example, a holder may determine
that it needs to take certain actions with respect to an UST or UST system's operations in order to preserve the value
of the foreclosed-on assets or to prevent a future release (such as by the removal of an UST or UST system's contents
as described below), or to otherwise prepare property for safe public access incident to sale or liquidation of assets.
Precisely because a holder in charge of an UST or UST system may need to take affirmative action with respect to the UST
or UST system incident to foreclosure and with respect to any petroleum products that are known to be present, the proposal
provides that such actions of dominion and control over the UST or UST system are considered necessary components
of holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest, provided such actions are undertaken to protect
the asset's value and are not undertaken for investment purposes. Therefore, under this proposed rule, such mitigative
or preventative measures are considered to be actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily
to protect the security interest in the UST or UST system.

(5) Winding up operations after foreclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in the post-foreclosure context, this proposed rule provides that a holder that forecloses on an UST
or UST system with ongoing operations may wind up the UST or UST system's operations without also being considered
to be participating in management. Winding up is considered a protected activity by a foreclosing holder because,
without such protection, foreclosure would not be possible where practical or commercial necessity dictates that
the foreclosing holder undertake such actions. ``Winding up'' in the post-foreclosure context includes those actions
that are necessary to close down an UST or UST system's operations, secure the site, and otherwise protect the value
of the foreclosed assets for subsequent sale or liquidation. In winding up an UST or UST system, a holder may undertake
all necessary security measures or take other actions that protect and preserve an UST or UST system's assets, including
steps taken to prevent or minimize the risk of a release or threat of release of the UST or UST system's contents.

D. Liability of a Holder as an Operator of an Underground Storage Tank or Underground Storage Tank System

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this proposed rule would be promulgated under authority to write regulations governing UST activities,
EPA intends that it be consistent with and further the purposes of the statutory security interest exemption found
at Section 9003(h)(9). One critical aspect of the RCRA subtitle I statutory security interest exemption is that while
it excludes a holder from the definition of ``owner'' for corrective action purposes, the statute does not explicitly
address a holder's responsibilities as an UST or UST system ``operator.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The absence of explicit language in the statute regarding operators creates a potential problem for holders, since
EPA's UST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action regulations (as described in Section II. B of this preamble) apply to both owners and operators
of underground storage tanks. Thus, although RCRA subtitle I clearly exempts holders from corrective action liability
as ``owners'' of USTs, the statute does not address whether such otherwise exempt persons face correction action
liability as ``operators'' of USTs. Without clear protection from corrective action liability as potential operators
of USTs, EPA believes that lenders will continue to be reluctant to make loans to UST-related businesses due to continued
uncertainty about their potential liability for corrective action. This regulatory proposal therefore addresses
a holder's potential liability for RCRA subtitle I corrective action as an ``operator'' of an UST or UST system.

Under RCRA Subtitle I, being an ``operator'' is not synonymous with ``participating in the management'' of an UST
or UST system. Section 9001(3)_Definitions and Exemptions_defines the term ``operator'' to mean ``any person in
control of, or having responsibility for, the daily operation of the UST system.'' A person may, without being an ``operator''
of an UST or UST system, be sufficiently involved so as to be participating in the management (as that term is defined
elsewhere in this proposal) of an UST or UST system.

1. Pre-Foreclosure Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to foreclosure, a holder who is in control of, or has responsibility for, the daily operation of an UST or UST system
is subject to the full range of requirements applicable to operators of USTs. In addition, a holder may also forfeit
the protection of the proposed regulatory security interest exemption from compliance with the UST regulatory program
as an owner if the holder participates in the management of an UST or UST system as defined in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a holder will not, as a general matter, have control of, or responsibility for, the daily operation of an UST
or UST system prior to foreclosure in its capacity as a secured creditor who holds indicia of ownership primarily to
protect a security interest. Prior to foreclosure, a holder is permitted to conduct those activities related to its
financial and administrative obligations of managing a loan portfolio. The holder in this position will not lose
its ability to take advantage of the proposed regulatory exemption exclusively as a result of engaging in these activities.
See Section III.C.5 of this preamble for a more complete discussion of this issue.

2. Post-Foreclosure Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a borrower defaults on its loan obligation and the holder, primarily to protect its security interest, forecloses
on the borrower's UST or UST system, the holder is faced with the decision to continue or suspend the storage or dispensing
of product from the UST. As with activities prior to foreclosure, a holder who operates an UST following foreclosure
(in any manner other than placing the UST in temporary or permanent closure as specified in this proposal) would, under
the current regulatory scheme, be an ``operator'' and subject to all subtitle I requirements. If the holder complies
with the requirements of this rule for placing a tank into temporary or permanent closure, a holder, although nevertheless
an operator, would be exempt from the subtitle I corrective action regulatory requirements otherwise applicable
to operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The strategies for complying with the UST technical standards described in this proposal include emptying tanks,
leaving vent lines open and functioning, capping and securing lines within 15 days after foreclosure, and performing
either temporary or permanent closure of the UST or UST system. Conversely, a foreclosing security holder who exercises
some other strategy for complying with the subtitle I technical requirements (or who fails to comply) could be an ``operator''
under the subtitle I regulations and would therefore be subject to the full panoply of subtitle I regulatory obligations
applicable to all operators of tanks including the corrective action regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as an UST or UST system continues to store product, future releases are possible. Consequently, EPA believes
that the best way to ensure that a holder's tanks will not contribute to contamination after the holder has taken possession
of the UST or UST system (particularly if the holder is exempted from EPA's corrective action regulations) is to require
the holder to empty its tanks of all petroleum product. An UST or UST system is empty_in accordance with &sect;280.70_when
all materials have been removed using commonly employed practices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch)
of residue, or 0.3 percent by weight, of the total capacity of the UST system, remain in the system. To ensure that the
UST system has been adequately secured, vent lines must be left open and functioning, and all other lines, pumps, manways,
and ancillary equipment must be capped and secured (&sect;280.70). Under today's proposal, holders who engage in
these activities within 15 days after foreclosure will be exempted from the corrective action requirements applicable
to ``operators.'' This is a reasonable condition on which to base this exemption since the threat of future contamination
will have been effectively abated for the temporary period of time that the property remains in foreclosure by emptying
the tank and complying with the other requirements of 40 CFR part 280, as described in this proposed rule. Compliance
with these requirements will also satisfy the technical requirements applicable to foreclosing holders as ``operators''
under the rule proposed today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that 15 days be allowed to empty the tank, and cap and secure all lines and equipment based on its familiarity
with companies that specialize in providing UST technical services and on the Agency's knowledge of the steps required
to properly complete these tasks. Based on this, EPA proposes that 15 days is a reasonable and adequate time frame that
limits the period of time during which a tank containing petroleum product may be left largely unattended. However,
the Agency is interested in receiving comments from any holders who feel that a 15-day time frame would be inadequate
for a holder to arrange for the completion of these tasks. EPA requests comments and data about the adequacy of a 15-day
time frame and information supporting an alternative time frame. Information supporting EPA's proposed time frame
is available from the Agency OUST docket, reference number UST 3&hyph;16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to emptying and securing the UST or UST system, a holder who wishes to take advantage of the proposed exemption
from subtitle I corrective action regulatory requirements as an operator must comply with the subtitle I requirements
for either temporary or permanent closure. A holder who chooses to permanently close its UST or UST system, must do
so in accordance with &sect;&sect;280.71 through 280.74, Subpart G_Out of Service UST Systems and Closure. A holder
who chooses to temporarily close its tanks is required, throughout the first 12 months following foreclosure, to
maintain corrosion protection and report any known or suspected releases from the UST system. In accordance with
&sect;280.70, release detection is not required as long as the UST system is empty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after 12 months in temporary closure status, the holder possesses an UST or UST system that does not meet either
the performance standards in &sect;280.20 for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements in &sect;280.21 (excluding
the spill and overfill equipment requirements), and the holder has not successfully disposed of the UST or UST system,
the holder must either permanently close the UST system in accordance with &sect;&sect;280.71 through 280.74 or
perform a site assessment in accordance with &sect;280.72(a) and apply for an extension through the appropriate
implementing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holder will only need to perform a site assessment if it has failed to sell or otherwise divest of its UST or UST system
property within 12 months after entering temporary closure and only if the tanks it has acquired have not been upgraded
or replaced to meet the requirements of &sect;280.20 for new UST systems or &sect;280.21 for upgraded systems. (UST
systems that are adequately protected from corrosion and equipped with leak detection devices pose a significantly
lower threat to human health and the environment than do substandard tanks.) The site assessment requirement can
also be satisfied if one of the external release detection methods allowed in &sect;280.43(e) or (f) is operating
at the end of the 12-month period, and the release detection method operating indicates that no release has occurred.
For those who are still in possession of tanks 12 months after foreclosure, many are expected to possess upgraded or
replaced tanks since much of the credit that is expected to be extended subsequent to this rule should be used for upgrading
or replacing substandard tanks. Under these circumstances, the holder would be allowed to remain in temporary closure
indefinitely. Therefore, EPA believes that few situations should call for a site assessment while the holder is in
temporary closure. For those cases in which a holder will find it necessary to perform a site assessment and apply for
a temporary closure extension, EPA does not believe that such a requirement will pose a significant additional burden
upon the holder, since it is increasingly a standard business practice for a site assessment to be conducted upon most
transfers of commercial property. (See Guidelines for an Environmental Risk Program, Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, February 25, 1993.) While in some cases the requirement may oblige a holder to perform a site assessment
sooner (within 12 months after foreclosure) rather than later (upon the date of sale or disposition of the UST or UST
system), EPA expects that in most cases a site assessment will, in all probability, be performed before the UST or UST
system is transferred to a subsequent purchaser.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the provision that requires an UST owner and operator to perform a site assessment in order to apply for
an extension 12 months after entering temporary closure (if a substandard UST or UST system has not been replaced or
upgraded) was to allow a variance mechanism for UST owners to avoid permanent closure of tanks, on a case-by-case basis.
The reason for requiring the site assessment before applying for an extension was based on EPA's concerns that prior
contamination could have occurred and could continue to spread from a temporarily closed UST system. Although a holder
would not be required to comply with EPA's UST corrective action regulations if contamination is discovered (provided,
of course, the holder satisfies the requirements of this proposed rule), it would be required to report evidence of
the contamination to the implementing agency (as discussed in the following subsection), who can then decide on the
appropriate course of action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course, a holder may choose to continue to operate the UST by storing or dispensing product after foreclosure, or
otherwise not exercise either of the options described above. The holder may determine that its interests will be
best served by forgoing the security interest exemption, continuing operation of the UST system, and perhaps realizing
a greater return of capital on the security interest by selling the property with the UST system as a going concern.
In such cases, the tank would be regulated in the same manner as a tank operated by any other person, and the holder would
be fully responsible as an operator for compliance with RCRA subtitle I regulations, including corrective action,
the UST technical standards, and financial responsibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the environment is adequately protected where a holder chooses either of the post-foreclosure
options described above for complying with the technical requirements of Subtitle I. Where the tank is removed from
service and emptied of its contents, the threat of an unknown or undetected leak resulting in environmental contamination
is abated; accordingly, the Agency believes it is appropriate to exempt a foreclosing holder from UST corrective
action regulatory requirements under these circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Lenders in Foreclosure Upon the Effective Date of the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency recognizes that some lenders may already hold UST properties through foreclosure or its equivalents at
the time the final rule is promulgated. Although EPA is primarily concerned about the future availability of capital
to UST owners and operators, rather than loans that have already been extended, the Agency recognizes that holders
may be concerned about their potential liability associated with current holdings acquired through foreclosure
or its equivalents affecting the extension of future UST loans. A holder who possesses an UST property at the time the
rule is promulgated may have tanks that still store product. It would be difficult to determine whether or not contamination
caused by a release from such tanks had occurred during the time that the holder had possession of the UST property.
A holder, therefore, could potentially be held liable as an UST operator if he has possession of a tank at the time the
final rule is promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comments on this aspect of today's proposal. We are interested in collecting data that will clarify whether
future UST loan decisions would be negatively affected if the security interest exemption is not extended to holders
possessing UST properties through foreclosure or its equivalents upon promulgation of this rule. In addition, EPA
is interested in comments addressing whether and how an exemption from the UST regulatory requirements could be structured
for holders of such tanks. Finally, we are also interested in receiving comments addressing the extent to which such
a regulatory exemption could impact human health and the environment.

4. Release Reporting Requirements Following Foreclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under today's proposal, upon foreclosure, a holder taking advantage of the proposed exemption from corrective action
regulations must nevertheless comply with the requirement in &sect;280.50 that the discovery of any releases from
the UST be reported to the implementing agency. Only the reporting requirement must be followed; the holder need not
comply with &sect;280.52, despite the reference to that provision in &sect;280.50. The release reporting requirement
of &sect;280.50 is part of Subpart E, which details the obligations for reporting known or suspected releases, investigating
off-site impacts, confirming that a release has occurred, and cleaning up spills and overfills. While subpart E generally
implements Subtitle I's corrective action and site investigation requirements, from which a holder may be excluded
under today's proposed rule, &sect;280.50 has historically been viewed by EPA as part of the UST technical standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holder is responsible, following foreclosure or its equivalents, for reporting to the implementing agency, any
discovery of released regulated substances, or any suspected release at an UST site or in the surrounding area. Such
reporting is considered necessary to ensure protection of human health and the environment. By informing the implementing
agency of a release, the implementing agency can then determine the appropriate response action, if any.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of today's proposed rule, a holder would have to perform release investigation and confirmation in
accordance with &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.53. Under today's proposal, a holder who chooses to take the tank(s)
out of service as described in this proposal is required to follow the procedures established in &sect;280.50 but
is not subject to the release investigation and confirmation requirements in &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.53.
A holder who elects to keep the tank(s) in operation is obligated to comply with all of the Subpart E requirements, including
those related to release investigation and confirmation, and corrective action.

E. Actions Taken to Protect Human Health and the Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the special position and role played by bona fide holders, as has been recognized by Congress in creating
the statutory exemption from corrective action liability, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to include
within the scope of protected UST or UST system activities certain lender actions which protect human health and the
environment. EPA believes that there are a number of activities in which a holder may engage after foreclosure which
can contribute to the protection of human health and the environment and in which the holder may engage and still meet
the terms of the proposed rule's exemption from regulatory requirements. Such activities include: Release response
and corrective action for UST systems, permanent or temporary closure of an UST or UST system, tank upgrades or replacements,
environmental investigations, maintenance of corrosion protection, and release reporting. The Agency believes
that protection of human health and the environment can be advanced by allowing a holder to participate in activities
associated with environmental compliance either prior to or following foreclosure on an UST or UST system. Environmental
compliance activities are generally considered to be integral to the daily operations of an UST or UST system, and
a person who participates in those activities would typically be considered an operator. However, a reasonable holder
may also undertake such activities in the course of maintaining its indicia of ownership in the tank to protect its
security interest. Therefore, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to propose that environmental compliance
activities, if undertaken by a holder, will nevertheless allow the holder to take advantage of the proposed exemption
from regulatory requirements. The Agency is not proposing that these activities be required of a holder as a condition
for obtaining the security interest exemption as an UST owner, but that holders be able to participate in these activities
without losing the protection of the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to foreclosure, therefore, and where the holder is otherwise permitted,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a holder may require the borrower to comply, or itself undertake to ensure compliance, with the subtitle I regulations
applicable to the tank owner and operator (typically, the borrower), without being deemed an ``operator'' under
the provisions of this proposed rule. EPA believes that a holder who is ensuring that a tank is operated as specified
in 40 CFR part 280 (even if the holder is itself performing the activities authorized or required by part 280) is acting
both to preserve the collateral (and therefore acting consistent with its capacity as a security interest holder)
and to protect human health and the environment. It is appropriate for a holder to intervene in such circumstances
in which human health and the environment are threatened by an UST owner or operator's improper management or operation
of its tank(s). However, undertaking activities that bring the tank(s) into compliance (i.e., regulatory compliance
actions such as tank testing, leak detection, upgrading, etc.) will not exempt a holder from complying with the UST
corrective action regulatory requirements if the holder is otherwise involved in the day-to-day operation of the
tank(s). All other acts of operation undertaken by a holder (such as filling the tank(s) with product, selling and/or
dispensing tank product, performing overall management functions, etc.) are not shielded activities under this
proposed rule because by doing so the holder displaces the borrower as the primary operator of the tank(s).

Furthermore, following foreclosure, where the holder chooses to take advantage of the conditional exemption from
the corrective action regulations by emptying and removing the tank from operation, as specified above, the Agency
proposes that the holder may_without losing the protection of the proposed rule_undertake cleanup activities consistent
with the corrective action requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart F at or in connection with the UST or UST system.
EPA specifically requests comments on this aspect of today's proposal.

IV. Financial Responsibility Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCRA section 9003(d), as implemented by EPA at 40 CFR part 280, subpart H_Financial Responsibility, requires owners
or operators of petroleum USTs to demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating
third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental UST releases. As discussed earlier under
Section III. A of this proposal, EPA is defining, for purposes of its Subtitle I corrective action and technical requirements,
the term ``owner'' to mean that a holder who maintains ownership rights in an UST or UST system primarily to protect
a security interest does not rise to level of a full ``owner,'' and therefore is not subject to compliance with those
regulatory requirements. As described earlier, this proposed revision of EPA's corrective action regulatory program
is consistent with the Subtitle I statutory security interest exemption. Similarly, the Agency believes that a holder
is not subject to the financial responsibility requirements as an UST owner. The Agency is also proposing to exempt
a holder as an UST operator from the financial responsibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before a holder takes possession of an UST or UST system, a holder is not considered an UST operator, for purposes of
EPA's technical and financial responsibility regulations, if it is acting merely as a holder and is not in control
of the daily operation of the UST or UST system. Therefore, a holder typically is not subject to the UST financial responsibility
requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart H as an operator prior to foreclosure. EPA is today proposing that a holder
be exempted from corrective action as an operator after foreclosure if it ensures that its tanks no longer store petroleum
and it complies with the temporary or permanent closure requirements specified in this rule. (See Section III. D.
2 of this preamble). In these situations, where the tanks are empty and pose little threat of release, it would serve
no useful purpose to require a holder to demonstrate compliance with the financial responsibility requirements
for corrective action. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to exempt holders who satisfy all the other requirements
in this proposed rule from demonstrating Subtitle I financial responsibility for UST corrective action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A holder's responsibility for demonstrating UST financial responsibility for third-party bodily injury and property
damage compensation poses a different issue. While RCRA Subtitle I does not include provisions that actually impose
third-party liability upon UST owners and operators, it does require UST owners and operators to demonstrate their
ability to compensate third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising
from the operation of an UST or UST system. The Agency believes that a holder who complies with all the conditions set
forth in today's proposal should not be required to comply with any of the UST financial responsibility requirements
as an owner or operator, including those for both corrective action and third-party liability coverage. EPA has chosen
to propose this exemption based on the statutory authority provided in section 9003. The proposed exemption is consistent
with the interpretation of that language adopted in the preamble to the UST financial responsibility final rule (53
FR 43323). In that rule, EPA exempted tanks taken out of operation prior to the effective date of the rule from UST financial
responsibility compliance. In the preamble to the final rule, EPA recognized that ``insurance providers would be
extremely reluctant to assure tanks taken out of operation because of the perceived greater uncertainty associated
with them'' (53 FR 43327). In particular, insurers have indicated that in the case of foreclosed USTs, they would be
concerned about vandalism and other threats to USTs at non-operational, unattended gas stations or similar locations
with public access. The preamble also states that ``even if providers of assurance would assure these tanks, it is
unlikely that they would cover leaks which occurred before the effective date of the policy'' (53 FR 43327). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar situation exists for holders who empty their tanks and enter temporary or permanent closure after foreclosure.
EPA has discovered that it is practically impossible to obtain third-party environmental insurance coverage for
a new owner of empty tanks. Providers of financial assurance are very reluctant to provide any coverage for tanks that
no longer store petroleum product. Further, providers are reluctant to provide coverage for damages that occur after
the effective date of the policy for releases that might have occurred prior to the effective date of the policy. Under
this proposed rule a holder is required to empty its tanks in order to be exempt from corrective action regulatory requirements.
Since providers are unlikely to provide any coverage for empty tanks at non-operational facilities or for releases
that occurred prior to foreclosure, and since third-party damages would be extremely unlikely to stem from releases
occurring after the holder forecloses on and empties its tanks, the Agency believes it is unnecessary to require third-party
liability coverage for such tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA section 9003(c)(6) supports this proposed exemption. That provision emphasizes the connection between the
UST financial responsibility requirement and a tank's operational status: ``The regulations promulgated pursuant
to this section shall include:&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;(6) requirements for maintaining evidence of
financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property
damage caused by sudden and nonsudden accidental releases arising from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
operating
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an underground storage tank.'' [emphasis added.] The Agency believes that since a holder must demonstrate that its
tanks are empty and that it is complying with the UST temporary or permanent closure requirements in order to avoid
corrective action liability as an operator, there should be no need for a holder who meets these requirements to demonstrate
financial responsibility for corrective action or third-party damages. By requiring the holder to empty the tank
in order to be exempt from corrective action requirements, EPA is ensuring that damages caused by future releases
from that tank will be minimized if not avoided altogether. As a result, EPA is proposing that holders who act in accordance
with the requirements described in this proposed rule be exempt from all subtitle I financial responsibility requirements.

V. State Program Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCRA subtitle I section 9004, as implemented by 40 CFR part 281, provides states the ability to operate an UST regulatory
program in lieu of the federal program if they first submit the program for review and receive approval from EPA. EPA
approval of a state program means that the requirements in the state's laws and regulations will be in effect rather
than the federal requirements. Program approval ensures that a single set of requirements (the state's) will be enforced
in that state, thus eliminating the duplication and confusion that can result from having separate state and federal
requirements. EPA considers state program approval to be an integral part of the UST regulatory program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's approval review focuses primarily on the basic state authorities (laws and regulations) needed to achieve
the underlying objectives of the federal regulations covering the UST technical standards, corrective action,
and financial responsibility requirements. The UST state program approval process is also based upon a performance-oriented
approach. The statutory test for an approvable state program is that it be ``no less stringent'' than the federal requirements
and include as many categories of UST systems (or be as broad in scope) as the federal requirements. EPA reviews the
state's specific statutory and regulatory provisions as well as their interpretation by the attorney general of
the state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule is not intended to present a barrier for states to receive state program approval. A state is
not required to have enacted a security interest exemption in order to receive approval of its program from EPA, since
failure to have such a provision would merely make the state program broader in scope than the federal one. However,
EPA encourages states to adopt statutory and/or regulatory provisions comparable to the final federal UST lender
liability rule so that credit-worthy UST owners and operators will have access to funds to upgrade or replace their
tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a state program includes an UST security interest exemption, EPA will evaluate it against the criteria in &sect;281.39,
as proposed in this notice. These criteria stem from the key components contained in this proposed rule. A state program
that exempts a holder from UST corrective action, financial responsibility, and technical requirements as an owner
may be approved if: The holder is maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum
UST or UST system; the holder does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system; and the holder does not
engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing. In addition, a state program may be approved if it exempts
a holder from corrective action and financial responsibility as an operator and if, in addition to the three previous
criteria, it requires the holder to demonstrate that its tanks have been emptied and secured, and that it has either
permanently or temporarily closed the UST or UST system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state's program application should address the issue of UST lender liability in the ``Scope'' section of its state
program description, under &sect;281.21(a)(3) of the State Program Approval regulations.

VI. Economic Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed elsewhere in this proposal, EPA believes that concerns over environmental liability are making a significant
number of lenders reluctant to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy owners and operators of USTs. A more analytical
approach to describing the current lending climate and the potential effects associated with today's proposal is
through a discussion of lending rates that UST owners are currently faced with, in comparison to those that may prevail
after promulgation of a final rule.

In analytical terms, prior to final promulgation of today's proposed rule, the rate that lenders charge now when considering
making an UST-related loan can be described as:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the current uncertainty regarding a holder's obligations to comply with the UST regulatory requirements,
the risk premium ``r
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' that banks have to charge in order to be adequately compensated for their risk in an UST-related loan may often be
so high that it effectively precludes lenders from making loans at this level. A related barrier to lending is that
since all UST owners bear a systematic risk imposed by government regulations, lenders cannot diversify to substantially
reduce or eliminate the UST-related risk premium, r
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by holding a portfolio of UST-related loans with different characteristics and risks. Since most UST owners and
operators are small businesses that cannot self finance, they will either forego or delay UST facility improvements.
While many UST-related loans are expected to be used for financing tank upgrades or replacements, these loans may
also be used to provide additional services at the facility (e.g., an expanded area for food items at a convenience
store). If lenders are precluded from making UST-related loans, both environmental protection and economic growth
may suffer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By providing the exemption for holders from UST regulatory requirements contained in this proposed rule and thus
reducing the uncertainty associated with making an UST-related loan, the risk premium is expected to be significantly
reduced. The interest rate relationship after final promulgation of today's proposed rule can be described as:

market
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (post rule), that is both adequate to compensate lenders for their perceived risk and at the same time affordable for
credit-worthy UST owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are social costs associated with owners' and operators' inability to use the least costly financial mechanism
to comply with the existing UST regulations. By reducing the risk premium to a level at which lenders are both willing
and able to make UST-related loans, this proposed regulation is expected to increase the ability of UST owners and
operators to comply with subtitle I regulations, thereby reducing these social costs. To the extent that loans are
made for environmental compliance purposes, social costs would also be reduced by decreasing the number and severity
of releases from old USTs that might otherwise occur in the absence of upgrading or replacing tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is interested in obtaining comments on how this proposed rule might allow UST owners and operators to use
less costly financial mechanisms to comply with UST regulations. Specifically, the Agency requests information
from lenders on the current interest rate charged for loans when property with one or more USTs is used as collateral.
The Agency also requests information from lenders regarding the extent to which credit might have been extended to
UST owners and operators in the past had this proposed rule been in effect.

contained in the ``Regulatory Background Document'' for this proposed rule, located in the OUST Docket at 401 M Street,

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it raises policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, agencies must evaluate the effects of a regulation on small
entities. If the rule is likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' then a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis must be performed. Because this proposed rule may actually result in cost savings for small
entities that hold security interests in USTs or UST systems, EPA certifies that today's proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 Participation in the management of an UST or UST system means, for purposes of this subpart, actual participation
in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the UST or UST system by the holder and does not include the
mere capacity or ability to influence or the unexercised right to control UST or UST system operations. A holder is
participating in management, while the borrower is still in possession of the UST or UST system encumbered by the security
interest, only if the holder either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Exercises decisionmaking control over the borrower's environmental compliance, such that the holder has undertaken
responsibility for the borrower's UST or UST system management; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exercises control at a level comparable to that of a manager of the borrower's enterprise, such that the holder
has assumed or manifested responsibility for the overall management of the enterprise encompassing the day-to-day
decisionmaking of the enterprise with respect to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Environmental compliance; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All, or substantially all, of the operational (as opposed to financial or administrative) aspects of the enterprise
other than environmental compliance. Operational aspects of the enterprise include functions such as that of facility
or plant manager, operations manager, chief operating officer, or chief executive officer. Financial or administrative
aspects include functions such as that of credit manager, accounts payable/receivable manager, personnel manager,
controller, chief financial officer, or similar functions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No act or omission prior to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest constitutes
evidence of participation in management within the meaning of this Subpart. A prospective holder who undertakes
or requires an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit) of
the UST or UST system in which indicia of ownership are to be held or requires a prospective borrower to clean up contamination
from the UST or UST system or to comply or come into compliance (whether prior or subsequent to the time that indicia
of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest) with any applicable law or regulation is not by such
action considered to be participating in the UST's or UST system's management.

Actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest do not constitute
participation in management for purposes of this subpart. The authority for the holder to take such actions may, but
need not, be contained in contractual or other documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental,
and other warranties, covenants, conditions, representations or promises from the borrower. Loan policing and
workout activities cover and include all such activities up to foreclosure or its equivalents, exclusive of any activities
that constitute participation in management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holder who engages in policing activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the
holder does not by such actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in &sect;280.210(a).
Such actions include, but are not limited to, requiring the borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system
during the term of the security interest; requiring the borrower to comply or come into compliance with applicable
federal, state, and local environmental and other laws, rules, and regulations during the term of the security interest;
securing or exercising authority to monitor or inspect the UST or UST system (including on-site inspections) in which
indicia of ownership are maintained, or the borrower's business or financial condition during the term of the security
interest; or taking other actions to adequately police the loan or security interest (such as requiring a borrower
to comply with any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower).

 A holder who engages in work out activities prior to foreclosure or its equivalents will remain within the exemption
provided that the holder does not by such action participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in
&sect;280.210(a). For purposes of this rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
work out
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to those actions by which a holder, at any time prior to foreclosure or its equivalents, seeks to prevent, cure,
or mitigate a default by the borrower or obligor; or to preserve, or prevent the diminution of, the value of the security.
Work out activities include, but are not limited to, restructuring or renegotiating the terms of the security interest;
requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising forbearance; requiring or exercising rights pursuant
to an assignment of accounts or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow
agreement pertaining to amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions,
counseling, or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties,
covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower.

Foreclosure on an UST or UST system and participation in management activities post-foreclosure_(1) Foreclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Indicia of ownership that are held primarily to protect a security interest include legal or equitable title acquired
through or incident to foreclosure or its equivalents. For purposes of this subpart, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
foreclosure or its equivalents
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 includes purchase at foreclosure sale; acquisition or assignment of title in lieu of foreclosure; termination of
a lease or other repossession; acquisition of a right to title or possession; an agreement in satisfaction of the obligation;
or any other formal or informal manner (whether pursuant to law or under warranties, covenants, conditions, representations,
or promises from the borrower) by which the holder acquires title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system.
The indicia of ownership held after foreclosure continue to be maintained primarily as protection for a security
interest provided that the holder undertakes to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing
transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or otherwise divest itself
of the UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner, using whatever commercially reasonable means are relevant
or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system, taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, and provided
that the holder did not participate in management (as defined in &sect;280.210(a)) prior to foreclosure or its equivalents.
For purposes of establishing that a holder is seeking to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease
financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or divest an
UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner, the holder may use whatever commercially reasonable means as
are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system, or may employ the means specified in &sect;280.210(c)(2).
A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon a written 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution
of the lessee), liquidate, wind up operations, and take measures to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured UST
or UST system prior to sale or other disposition. The holder may conduct these activities without voiding the exemption,
subject to the requirements of this subpart.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A holder establishes that the ownership indicia maintained following foreclosure or its equivalents continue
to be held primarily to protect a security interest by, within 12 months following foreclosure, listing the UST or
UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals
with the type of property in question, or by advertising the UST or UST system as being for sale or disposition on at least
a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the UST or UST system
in question, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable
under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil
procedure) covering the area where the UST or UST system is located. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period
begins to run from the time that the holder acquires marketable title, provided that the holder, after the expiration
of any redemption or other waiting period provided by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title. If the
holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title, the 12-month period begins to run on the date of foreclosure
or its equivalents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or the
facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located establishes by such outbidding, rejection, or failure
to act, that the ownership indicia in the secured UST or UST system are not held primarily to protect the security interest,
unless the holder is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make a higher bid, to obtain
a higher offer, or to seek or obtain an offer in a different manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fair consideration, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a senior security interest in the UST
or UST system, is the value of the security interest as defined in this section. The value of the security interest is
calculated as an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of the outstanding principal (or comparable amount in the case
of a lease that constitutes a security interest) owed to the holder immediately preceding the acquisition of full
title (or possession in the case of an UST or UST system subject to a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure
or its equivalents, plus any unpaid interest, rent, or penalties (whether arising before or after foreclosure or
its equivalents), plus all reasonable and necessary costs, fees, or other charges incurred by the holder incident
to work out, foreclosure or its equivalents, retention, preserving, protecting, and preparing the UST or UST system
prior to sale, re-lease of an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease
financing transaction or substitution of the lessee) or other disposition, plus environmental investigation and
corrective action costs incurred under &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67; less any amounts received by the holder
in connection with any partial disposition of the property and any amounts paid by the borrower subsequent to the acquisition
of full title (or possession in the case of an UST or UST system subject to a lease financing transaction) pursuant to
foreclosure or its equivalents. In the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a junior
security interest, fair consideration is the value of all outstanding higher priority security interests plus the
value of the security interest held by the junior holder, each calculated as set forth in the preceding sentence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system received at any time after six months following foreclosure
or its equivalents. A ``written, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
firm offer'' means a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, cash offer solely for the foreclosed UST or UST
system, including all material terms of the transaction, from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates
to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. For purposes of this provision, the six-month period begins
to run from the time that the holder acquires marketable title, provided that the holder, after the expiration of any
redemption or other waiting period provided by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title. If the holder
fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title, the six-month period begins to run on the date of foreclosure
or its equivalents.

(a) A state is not required to have a security interest exemption to obtain or maintain RCRA Subtitle I program approval.
If a state enacts a security interest exemption provision, it does not have to be as extensive as the security interest
exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I, as defined in &sect;&sect;280.200 through 280.250, to obtain
or maintain RCRA subtitle I program approval. However, a state's security interest exemption cannot be broader in
scope or less stringent than the security interest exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A state program will be considered to be no less stringent than, and as broad in scope as, the federal program provided
that the state provision: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Mirrors the security interest exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Achieves the same effect as provided by the following key criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A holder, meaning a person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum
UST or UST system, who does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system as defined under &sect;280.210
and who does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing as defined under &sect;280.200(a) is not:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An ``owner'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR part 280 requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An ``operator'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR part 280 requirements

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) is responsible for the establishment
of a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in courts of the United States.
He must prescribe, determine, and certify the qualifications of person who may serve as certified interpreters in
bilingual proceedings and proceedings involving the hearing impaired (28 U.S.C. 1827(b)). Whenever an interpreter
is required for a person in any criminal or civil action initiated by the United States, the presiding judicial officer
must utilize the services of the most available certified interpreter, unless no certified interpreter is reasonably
available, or the services of an otherwise qualified interpreter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AOUSC will provide the courts with a roster of certified, professionally qualified, and language skilled court
interpreters selected on the basis of specific qualification criteria and/or the successful completion of written
ad oral examinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For Spanish language interpreter candidates, a comprehensive written Spanish/English examination testing bilingual
proficiency in Spanish and English will be administered. For candidates in the Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean languages,
a written English examination testing proficiency in English will be administered. Successful candidates will
be invited to sit for the second part of the certification examinations, an oral examination. The oral examination
will test, in simulated settings, the applicant's ability to: (1) interpret precisely from source language to English,
in consecutive and simultaneous modes; (2) interpret from English to the target language in consecutive and simultaneous
modes; and (3) perform sight interpretations. The oral portion of the examination does not necessarily require previous
experience in court interpreting. Applicants who successfully complete the written examination will receive notice
of the time and place of the oral portion of the examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, Mien, Polish, and Russian interpreter candidates, a written English examination testing
proficiency in English will be administered. The second part of the qualification process as a professional or language
skilled court interpreter will require the candidate to provide additional qualifications and credentials or perform
back translation exercises successfully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the examinations are developed and administered under contract by the University of Arizona. The written portion
of the examination does not require a special knowledge of legal vocabulary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Sucessful completion of the written examination is the first step in the process of receiving certification or ``otherwise
qualified'' status. There is no formal educational requisite, either in languages or interpreting, for successfully
completing the written examinations. However, the difficulty of the written examinations are at the college degree
level of proficiency in both English and the target languages. Successful completion of the oral portion of the examination
normally would require prior training or professional experience in simultaneous and consecutive interpreting
and sight translation. Qualification as ``otherwise qualified'' will require additional credentials and experience
as an interpreter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Certification or ``otherwise qualified'' status will not necessarily lead to full-time employment as a staff or
contract interpreter. Most of the requirements for court interpretation services in the Federal courts are met by
independent interpreter contractors on an as-needed basis. However, where full-time interpreters are needed,
only certified interpreters are eligible for appointment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the federal courts require full-time salaried interpreters, these interpreters will be chosen from the eligibility
lists. The annual salary range is JSP&hyph;10 to JSP&hyph;14 ($31,898&hyph;$76,733) for full-time salaried interpreters.
For certified interpreters who provide services as independent contractors, the fee is $250 per day.

Court interpreters perform all or some of the following duties: (1) Interpret verbatim in simultaneous and consecutive
modes a foreign language into English, and vice versa, at arraignments, preliminary hearings, pretrial hearings,
trials, and other court proceedings; (2) transcribe and translate electronic sound recordings; and (3) sight translate
or translate in written form technical, medical, and legal documents and correspondence for introduction as evidence.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service and APHIS cooperate in discharging Federal obligations under the Animal Damage Control Act of
1931 (7 U.S.C. 426&hyph;426b) which governs animal damage management activities on National Forest System lands.
These activities include actions to provide wildlife damage management through direct control, as well as technical
assistance to achieve desired management objectives. APHIS, in cooperation with the Forest Service and states,
carries out animal damage management activities on some National Forest System lands, mostly to minimize livestock
losses from predation by coyotes, black bears, and other predators. Under other authorities (e.g., Multiple-Use
Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 [16 U.S.C. 528(note), 528&hyph;531]), the Forest Service conducts activities to control
animal damage caused by small mammals and other animals to National Forest System resources, such as timber stands
and roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APHIS has responsibility for animal damage management activities, as designated by the Secretary of Agriculture
(7 CFR 2.51(41)). The principal change being proposed in existing Forest Service Manual policy (FSM 2650) is the designation
of APHIS as the lead agency for preparing environmental documentation on animal damage management activities initiated
by APHIS on National Forest System lands. The Forest Service will cooperate with APHIS and the states in environmental
analysis and documentation of actions proposed by APHIS that will occur on or affect National Forest System lands
and provide mitigation measures needed to ensure that animal damage management activities performed by APHIS are
compatible with direction provided in forest land and resource management plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed policy would bring the Forest Service Manual provisions into conformance with current field-level
animal damage management practice. Current operational procedures for animal damage management activities are
outlined in an August 25, 1992 letter to Forest Service Regional Foresters from Deputy Chief James C. Overbay and the
subsequent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between APHIS and the Forest Service, signed June 18, 1993. Notice
of availability of the MOU was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 13, 1993 (58 FR 37704).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 MOU clarifies the role of each Forest Supervisor in cooperating with APHIS and the states in documentation
of environmental actions proposed by APHIS, and in providing mitigation measures to ensure that animal damage management
activities performed by APHIS are compatible with direction provided in forest plans. The MOU also clarifies that
APHIS, in cooperation with the Forest Service, develops work plans for animal damage management activities on National
Forest System lands. These plans address control areas, specific control techniques, emergency control procedures,
timeframes, and other limitations and restrictions. The MOU recognizes APHIS work plans as the definitive plans
for predator control actions on National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After discussion with the Council on Environmental Quality, the Forest Service has decided to publish this proposed
animal damage management policy in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, inviting public comment on the role and responsibility of the Forest Service in coordinating with APHIS on animal
damage management. In the interim, the Forest Service and APHIS will follow procedures outlined in the 1993 MOU for
which notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 31.1b(2) of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, Sept. 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in
an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Servicewide administrative
procedures, program processes, or instructions.'' This proposed policy would provide administrative instructions
to Forest Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of coordination with APHIS on
animal damage management activities. Accordingly, the agency's preliminary assessment is that this proposed policy
falls within this category of action and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation
of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption
of the final policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit, along with
the states, cooperate in discharging the Federal obligations under the Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 to manage
animal damage on National Forest System lands. These activities include actions to provide wildlife damage management
through direct control, as well as technical assistance to achieve desired management objectives. APHIS carries
out animal damage management activities on National Forest System lands, mostly to minimize livestock losses from
predation by coyotes, black bears, and other predators. The Forest Service conducts activities to control animal
damage caused by small mammals and other animals to National Forest System resources, such as timber stands and roads.

2650.1_Authority.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the authorities listed in FSM 2601, the following authorities govern animal damage management activities
on National Forest System lands:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931 (7 U.S.C. 426&hyph;426b) as amended by the Rural Development, Agriculture,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;202) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture
to provide animal damage management services, to maintain technical expertise for evaluating and recommending
animal damage management techniques, and to conduct forest and range animal damage research. The Secretary has delegated
this authority to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Executive Order 12342, January 24, 1982, permits the use of chemical toxicants registered by the Environmental
Protection Agency for predator damage control on federal lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Department of Agriculture Regulation (DR) 9500&hyph;4 (FSM 2601.2) requires Department of Agriculture programs
to include measures to alleviate damage by plant and animal pests; develop new techniques and methodologies through
management and research programs to limit damage to agriculture or forestry production; and apply integrated pest
management practices, where feasible, in carrying out these responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between APHIS and the Forest Service outlines the cooperative approach to
animal damage management on National Forest System lands. Both agencies have a joint responsibility for limiting
damage caused by wildlife. In this MOU, APHIS and state agencies are recognized as having the authority and expertise
to conduct predator control on National Forest System lands, to determine livestock losses, and to determine methodology
for animal damage management. See FSM &sect;1543.14 for the full text of the MOU.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2650.2_Objective.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The objective of animal damage management activities is to protect National Forest System resources, to protect
activities taking place on National Forest System lands, and to reduce threats to human health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2650.3_Policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 National Forest System resources must be adequately protected during animal damage management activities authorized
by the states and conducted by the states or Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control
unit. When the Forest Service conducts animal damage management activities, such as controlling small mammal populations
on plantations, the agency must comply fully with state and federal laws. In carrying out animal damage management
activities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Rely upon APHIS or the state agencies to provide the expertise and conduct predator control on National Forest System
lands, to determine livestock losses, and to determine methodology for animal damage management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cooperate with APHIS, the lead agency, in preparing environmental documentation for predator control and other
animal damage management activities initiated by APHIS on National Forest System lands. The Forest Service shall
cooperate to ensure that the animal damage management plans developed by APHIS will provide for protection of National
Forest System resources.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that imports of steel wire rod from Belgium are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United
States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated
margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on March 7, 1994, (59 FR 11773, March 14, 1994), the following events have
occurred: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
in this case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 7, 1994, the Department issued an antidumping duty questionnaire to Forges de Thy-Marcinelle (``Thy-Marcinelle'')
for the investigation. The questionnaire had four sections: section A, requesting general information; section
B, requesting information on U.S. sales; section C, requesting information on home market sales; and section D, requesting
information on cost of production and constructed value. In that same month, the Department presented the antidumping
duty questionnaire to Thy-Marcinelle, because it represented at least 60 percent of exports to the United States
during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 22, 1994, Thy-Marcinelle requested a two-week extension for filing the response to the Department's questionnaire.
The Department granted this extension request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1994, Thy-Marcinelle notified the Department that it would not be participating in this investigation.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are hot-rolled carbon steel and alloy steel wire rod, in coils, of approximately
round cross section, between 0.20 and 0.75 inches in solid cross-sectional diameter. The following products are
excluded from this investigation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Free-machining steel containing 0.03% or more of lead, 0.05% or more of bismuth, 0.08% or more of sulfur, more

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wire rod, which is 5.5 mm or less in diameter, with tensile strength greater than or equal to 1040 Mega-Pascals
(MPa), and the following chemical content, by weight: carbon greater than or equal to 0.79 percent, aluminum less
than or equal to 0.005 percent, phosphorous plus sulfur less than or equal to 0.040 percent and nitrogen less than or
equal to 0.006 percent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wire rod, which is 7.9 to 18.0 mm in diameter, containing 0.48 to 0.73 percent carbon by weight and certified
as having partial decarburization and seams no more than 0.075 mm in depth; and

Such or Similar Comparisons
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that the merchandise covered by this investigation constitutes a single category of ``such or
similar'' merchandise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Best Information Available
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because Thy-Marcinelle failed to respond to our questionnaire, we based our determination on best information available
(BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a party refuses to
provide requested information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to the Department's two-tiered BIA methodology
outlined in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise
significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company
the higher of (1) The highest margin alleged in the petition, or (2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in
the investigation. (See

996 F. 2d 1185, 1191&hyph;92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation,
we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, a margin of 52.34 percent, the highest margin calculated in the petition
(adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the initiation notice).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of steel wire rod from Belgium that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This guidance is issued pursuant to the authority of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1451&hyph;1464)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following guidance outlines OCRM standards for states and territories with Federally approved coastal management
programs, and those developing management programs, to meet the public participation requirement under the Coastal
Zone Management Act section 306(d)(14), as amended by Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization
Amendments of 1990. This section states that before approving a management program submitted by a coastal state,
the Secretary of Commerce shall find that ``[t]he management program provides for public participation in permitting
processes, consistency determinations, and other similar decisions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of this requirement extends to all activities that require specific or general authorization through permitting,
consistency review, or other means pursuant to the enforceable policies of the coastal management program, and applicable
state law. This guidance applies to all state authorizations subject to the statutory public participation requirement
and shall not conflict with existing state or Federal regulations pertaining to Federal permitting processes, state
permitting processes, and Federal consistency review of Federally permitted or licensed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has reviewed public participation opportunities under state coastal zone management programs and has determined
that existing public participation procedures under state law satisfy the public participation requirement under
section 306(d)(14) for state permits. For applications under state general permits, public participation in the
review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing for a general determination of consistency with the
Federally approved state coastal management program will satisfy the public participation requirement. NOAA's
regulations already require public participation in state Federal consistency reviews of Federally permitted
or licensed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NOAA finds that section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only
on the state's review of Federal agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section
307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation
procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following guidance outlines an acceptable standard for meaningful public participation. State coastal zone
management programs will have one year to comply with this guidance. Within one year, each state is to: (1) Develop
public participation procedures for the review of direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA,
if necessary, and submit a copy of those procedures to OCRM as a program change or submit documentation that procedures
are already incorporated into the approved program and (2) conduct a review to determine if other public participation
procedures are necessary. If additional procedures are necessary, the state must submit a copy of the procedures
developed to OCRM as a program change. If no further procedures are needed, the state must submit to OCRM a notice that
a review has been conducted and that no additional procedures are necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This guidance is sufficiently broad to give states flexibility in developing public participation procedures that
meet the intent of section 306(d)(14). OCRM will review each state's procedures during regularly scheduled evaluations
of state coastal zone management programs under section 312 of the CZMA for compliance with the public participation
requirement under section 306(d)(14), and will recommend procedural changes if necessary to meet OCRM's guidance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The draft language of the Policy Guidance itself does not clearly specify that the procedures apply only to consistency
reviews under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing
public participation procedure, although that fact is stated in the discussion preceding the guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA concurs and has added specific language in the guidance to clarify this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several states expressed concern that implementing this guidance will add to the state's administrative costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA is sensitive to this issue and structured the guidance to provide coastal states with a range options for implementing
the requirement in a cost-effective manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA should change the language under (a)(1) to say that ``States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice *&blank;*&blank;*''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recognizing that this comment is consistent with the provision allowing for joint public notice with Federal agencies,
NOAA has clarified this point in the final guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of the word ``guidance'' coupled with the use of mandatory terms such as ``must'', ``mandatory'', and ``at
a minimum'' may be confusing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This guidance represents NOAA's interpretation of the statutory requirement by outlining what it considers to be
effective public public participation. NOAA recognizes that the guidance itself is not the enforceable policy.
Rather, the obligation of coastal states to comply rests in the language of section 306(d)(14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Guidance to Implement CZMA Section 306(d)(14)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only on the state's review of Federal
agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other
state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation procedure. For applications
under state general permits, public participation in the review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing
for a general determination of consistency will satisfy the public participation requirement. The public should
have an opportunity to comment on a project's relationship with the state coastal management program's goals and
policies. NOAA interprets the statute to require the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) States must provide timely public notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice at the earliest practicable time after the application
and/or consistency determination has been received by the lead state coastal management agency, except in cases
where earlier public notice on the consistency determinations by the relevant Federal agency meets OCRM's standards
for acceptable public notice listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A public comment period must be provided. The length of the comment period may vary in accordance with state or Federal
law, and as appropriate for the type of authorization involved. However, the comment period must be sufficient to
give the public a meaningful opportunity to develop and provide comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Public participation, at a minimum, must consist of written public notice and solicitation of public comments.
Provision for a public hearing or meeting may also be provided. If a state chooses to use public hearings or public meetings
to provide for effective public participation, such hearings or meetings should be held in a location accessible
to most interested or affected parties to the maximum extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The written public notice must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) specify that the proposed activity is subject to review for consistency uunder the policies of the state coastal
management program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) provide sufficient information to serve as a basis for meaningful comment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) specify a source for additional information; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) specify a contact for submitting comments to the state coastal management program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) At a minimum, the public notice must be provided in the area(s) of the coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity.
Procedural options that may be used include, but are not limited to, the options listed below.The use of one or more
of the following must also conform with the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) public notice through an official state gazette;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) public notice through a local newspaper serving areas of coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) public notice through individual state mailings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) public notice through a state coastal zone management newsletter; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) arrangements between a state coastal management program and appropriate Federal agencies for joint public notice
to be provided by the state and Federal agency where direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) are involved
OCRM also encourages other streamlined procedures for providing public participation. Federal agency notice of
a proposed activity would suffice if it meets the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. 1461, establishes the National
Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS). 16 U.S.C. 1461 (e)(1)(B) authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make
grants to any coastal state or public or private person for purposes of supporting research and monitoring within
a national estuarine reserve that are consistent with the research guidelines developed under subsection (c). This
program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under ``Coastal Zone Management Estuarine Research
Reserve,'' Number 11.420.

II. Information on Established National Estuarine Research Reserves
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NERRS consists of estuarine areas of the United States which are designated, developed, and managed for research
and educational purposes. Each National Estuarine Research Reserve (Reserve) within the NERRS is chosen to reflect
regional differences and to include a variety of ecosystem types in accordance with the classification scheme of
the national program as presented in 15 CFR part 921.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Reserve is suited to support a wide range of beneficial uses of ecological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic
value which are dependent upon maintenance of a healthy ecosystem. Each site provides habitat for a wide range of ecologically
and commercially important species of fish, shellfish, birds, and other aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Each
Reserve has been designed to ensure its effectiveness as a conservation unit and as a site for long-term research and
monitoring. As part of a national system, the Reserves collectively provide an excellent opportunity to address
research questions and estuarine management issues of national significance. For a detailed description of the
sites, contact individual site Managers and/or Research Coordinators. The on-site contacts and addresses of the
National Estuarine Research Reserves are provided in Appendix I.

III. Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds are available on a competitive basis to any public or private university, qualified public or private institution,
individual, or coastal state (including Great Lakes States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,
and the Northern Marianas Islands) to conduct research within National Estuarine Research Reserves. Because NOAA
has substantial involvement in the research, NERRS research funds are normally awarded through a cooperative agreement.
NOAA may be involved in the project in the following manner:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Sanctuaries and Reserves Division (SRD), Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, reserves the right
to immediately halt activity on this project if it becomes obvious that the project is not fulfilling the mission of
the National Estuarine Research Reserve System goals. Day-to-day management is the responsibility of the Principal
Investigators, however, frequent guidance and direction is provided by the Federal Government for the successful
conduct of this project. Non-compliance with a Federally approved management plan may result in immediate halting
of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is our intention to review and approve each stage of work before the next begins to assure quality scientific progression
and results that will produce viable information on which to form valid, productive coastal management decisions.

Managers, Research Coordinators, and all other staff at NERRS sites are ineligible to submit competitive research
proposals under this Announcement. In FY92 through FY94, SRD provided funding in the amount of approximately $700,000,
each year, for research in the NERRS. The approximate range of funding per successful project in recent years has been
between $30,000 and $70,000. In FY95, it is expected that approximately $700,000 will be available for funding new
one- and two-year projects at similar levels. Federal funds requested must be matched by the applicant by at least
30% of the total cost of the project. For example, it the total project cost is $10,000, the Federal share is $7,000,
the non-Federal match is $3,000.

IV. Purpose and Priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Research funds are used to support management-related projects that will: enhance scientific understanding of
Reserve environments; provide information needed by Reserve Managers and coastal zone decision makers; and improve
public awareness of estuaries and estuarine management issues. Research projects may be oriented to specific Reserves;
however, projects that involve or benefit more than one Reserve in the national system will be given higher priority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary research objective for the NERRS is the study of the causes and effects of natural and anthropogenically-induced
change in the ecology of esturaine and estuarine-like ecosystems. All research funded through SRD should be designed
to provide information of significant value to the development and implementation of resource management policy
governing the U.S. coastal zone, for which NOAA's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management has management
and regulatory responsibilities. Beginning in FY93, SRD established a series of two-year research priority categories
to serve as foci for the SRD competitive research program (see below). The FY95&hyph;96 research priority, which
is the subject of this notice, is habitat restoration. Every two years, SRD will review future research needs and establish
the next two-year research priority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research proposals for FY95 should be designed to answer some aspect(s) of the following broad management-oriented
question: What are the most appropriate methods, experimental designs, models and/or evaluative criteria for restoring
estuarine and estuarine-like ecosystems? While this theme is the primary funding priority for SRD in FY95/96, consideration
may also be given to other projects of special merit that address other significant coastal management issues (e.g.,
non-point source pollution) on a regional or national scale. The availability of funding for such projects of special
merit will, however, be extremely limited, and will be determined after the primary research priority has been addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research proposals submitted in response to this announcement must: address coastal management issues identified
as having regional or national significance; relate them to the National Research Priority described in this announcement;
and be conducted (at least partially) within one or more designated NERRS sites. Research projects are funded for
a duration of either one or two years. Multiple year projects will always be initiated in the first year of a two-year
priority. One-year projects may be submitted in either year of a two-year priority. Therefore, proposals submitted
under this announcement for FY95 funding may be of one- or two-year duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research topic and the Reserve must be carefully chosen to ensure that the resource management issues of primary
concern to the Reserve and the NERRS are addressed. Thus, it is critical that all prospective researchers contact
the appropriate Reserve manager or research coordinator before submitting a proposal responding to this announcement.

C. Proposal Review and Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pre-proposals will be reviewed as outlined in section A, ``Pre-proposals,'' above. All full proposals will be reviewed
by: SRD research staff; at least two outside individuals who are acknowledged experts in the particular field represented
by the proposal; and an outside panel of experts. Each full proposal is also forwarded to the appropriate SRD Regional,
State Coastal Zone Management, and Reserve staffs for comments. Verbatim copies of all peer reviews, excluding the
name of the reviewer, will be sent to the applicant. Applicants will have two weeks to address and rebut peer reviews.
These rebuttals will be considered by SRD when final funding decisions are made. All recommendations for funding
by SRD must be approved by the NOAA Grants Management Division before awards are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide for the fair and equitable selection of the most meritorious research projects for support, SRD
has established specific criteria for their review and evaluation. These criteria are intended to be applied to all
research proposals in accordance with the SRD Research Priorities set forth in this announcement. The criteria used
in both pre-proposal and full proposal review process are listed below, together with the elements that constitute
each criterion and their relative weights (in parenthesis):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Scientific Merit (40%). This criterion is used to evaluate whether the objectives of the proposal are: important
to the field; consistent with the stated national research priorities; and likely to improve the scientific understanding
of estuarine processes within the Reserve(s) as well as in other similar estuaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Technical Approach (40%). This criterion is used to assess: the technical feasibility of the proposed effort;
the reasonableness of the hypotheses; the degree to which the proposed timeline is realistic; the appropriateness
and scientific validity of the proposed analytical methods; the degree to which the proposal demonstrates an understanding
of the Reserve environment and management needs; the current state of knowledge in the particular field of research
interest; and the total research requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Qualifications of P.I. and Key Personnel (10%). This criterion relates to the experience and past performance
of the principal investigator and key personnel, their familiarity with the geographic area of the proposed study,
and their publication record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Institutional Support and Capabilities (5%). This criterion relates to the extent of the applicant institution's
support for and commitment to the proposed research and what facilities, equipment, and other resources are available
to the principal investigator and key personnel from his/her institution for use in accomplishing the proposed work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Budget (5%). This criterion is used to determine whether the budget is realistic and reasonable for accomplishing
the proposed tasks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The external panel will review and rank the proposals based solely on the technical criteria above. The panel will
submit its rankings to SRD. In making final funding decisions among qualified proposals ranked highly by the above
technical criteria, SRD will also take into consideration the following programmatic policy factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utility to Reserve Management and to Regional Coastal Management Issues. This criterion is used to assess the likelihood
that results of this research will support the management of the affected Reserve(s) and will enhance wise coastal
resource management within the region(s) of study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relevance to National Research Priorities and Utility to National Coastal Management Issues. This criterion is
used to assess the relationship between the objectives of the proposed project and the National Research Priorities
established by NOAA, and to assess the likelihood that results of this research will be important to national coastal
management issues across the NERR System and coastal states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, proposals ranked highest on technical criteria will not necessarily receive funding from SRD. Final
funding decisions will be made by the Chief of the Sanctuaries and Reserves Division, based upon review panel rankings
and programmatic considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permit No. 843 authorizes the permit holder to conduct aerial, boat, and ground surveys and scat collections for harbor
seals (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phoca
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

vitulina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) at haulouts and rookeries in Alaska over a 4-year period ending in 1997. The permit holder now seeks authorization
to capture and radio tag up to 50 harbor seals in order to determine a correction factor to be applied towards the number
of seals at sea or moving between haulout sites, and thus missed by aerial surveys. The permittee estimates that up
to 200a dditional seals may be disturbed incidental to the capture/tagging activities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based
on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) (B), (C), (D) and 600.14(d) to the University of Illinois, Department
of the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) under cooperative agreement number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94E124855.
The purpose of the proposed agreement is to revise the Energy Information Administration (EIA) demonstrated reserve
base (DRB) of coal for the State of Illinois, with new quantity/quality data. This agreement is necessary to achieve
program objectives, conserve public funds and is essential to the public interest. This effort will have a total estimated
cost of $83,000 to be provided by the DOE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The (ISGS) is the State authority on Illinois coal resources. This agreement will assist the State of Illinois in its
efforts to continually collect analyses on coal quality and perform geological mapping to determine the quantity
and quality of coal reserves in the state.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cooperative agreement will provide funding for the ISGS to develop Phase I Coal Reserves Data Base (CRDB) coal
resource data for updated estimates of the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) and recoverable reserves of coal in Illinois,
allocated to specified ranges of sulfur content and heat content. The DRB constitutes the foundation data for coal
reserve analyses. Recoverable reserve data derived from the DRB comprise the pivotal data base for analyzing future
coal supplies. Data development may include analyses of coal geology, resource quantities, coal quality characteristics,
and other factors that affect resource accessibility and minability. Data output must include remaining identified
resources, DRB, remaining accessible reserve base, recoverable reserves, allocated by coal rank, type of mining,
and (excepting identified resources) heat and sulfur content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has determined that the proposed agreement meets the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) (B), (C) and (D) in
that (1) The activities are being conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provided by
third parties; however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows
of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity, (2) the ISGS is a unit of state government
and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction,
thereby precluding DOE provision of support to another entity, and (3) the ISGS has exclusive domestic capability
to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique equipment, proprietary data and technical expertise, or
other such unique qualifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISGS is charged with the responsibility of mapping and estimating the coal resources for the State of Illinois
and possesses over 1,300 agency-collected analyses including sulfur contents and heat values. This data, along
with data from other sources, will enable them to revise the coal reserves by quality and mining method for Illinois.
No other private or government entity is known to have the data and mapping capability required to estimate the coal
reserves by quality for the State of Illinois.

Golden Spread proposes to amend Schedule A for each Rate Schedule to add a special facilities charge provision and
a Rider A, which contains the formula to be used in calculating the special facilities charge. The special facilities
charge will allow Golden Spread to recover costs from a member related to a transmission or distribution facility
which that member has requested that Golden Spread acquire, construct, or cause to be constructed. In addition, Golden
Spread filed a Special Facilities Agreement with Midwest which provides for the construction by Golden Spread of
a nine mile segment of 69 Kv line on the Midwest system, with associated costs being recovered from Midwest under the
special facilities charge provision.

National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution) under authorization issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, National proposes to construct and operate a delivery point located in the Town of Clarence, Erie County,
New York. The facilities will include valves, regulators, heaters, filters, meters, piping and appurtenant facilities.
National indicates that all facilities will be placed in a previously disturbed area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National indicates that the total volume to be delivered to the customer is estimated to be 250,000 Mcf annually. National
states that the total volumes to be delivered to the customer would not exceed the total volume authorized prior to
this request. National states that this FERC Gas Tariff does not prohibit the addition of delivery points. National
further states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries proposed herein without detriment or
disadvantage to its other customers and that this will have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual deliveries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice
of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest
to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity is deemed to be authorized
effective on the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days
after the time allowed for filling a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

Take notice that on May 26, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) filed a Stipulation and Agreement (Stipulation)
proposing amendments to its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, pursuant to Rule 602 (18 CFR 385.602). Tennessee
has included an appendix with pro forma tariff sheets containing the modifications necessitated by the Stipulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Stipulation effects service changes in three areas: (1) Supply aggregation through pooling; (2) automatic balancing
through storage in conjunction with a balancing agreement; and (3) determination and resolution of imbalances.
Tennessee states that these service changes are the result of discussions between Tennessee and various groups of
customers on its system. Tennessee states that the Stipulation serves to complement the service structure recently
implemented pursuant to Order No. 636 so as to provide customers with enhanced services while protecting operational
integrity. Tennessee states that the filing has been served on all parties listed in the Docket No. RS92&hyph;23 service
list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are automatically parties to this proceeding. Any other person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference
to said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214. All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before June 15, 1994.
Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve
to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Any persons wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection in the public reference room. Pursuant to Rule
602, initial comments on the proposed Stipulation must be filed on or before June 15, 1994, and reply comments on June
27, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste will comply with the revised Federal
Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule
for such determinations. The USEPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule
(STIR) that will provide procedures by which the USEPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal MSWLF permit
programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted.
Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy
determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may
use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important
benefit. Approved State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator
regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved
MSWLF permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by the revised Federal Criteria to the extent
the State/Tribe MSWLF permit program allows such flexibility. The USEPA notes that regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the revised Federal Criteria apply to all
permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. At the same time, Ohio proposed rule revisions
that would facilitate full approval of its solid waste program. The proposed rule revisions added definitions and
requirements that were no less stringent than portions of the revised Federal Criteria. The USEPA reviewed Ohio's
application and tentatively determined that Ohio's existing MSWLF permit program, along with the incorporation
of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria, would be adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal
Criteria. Ohio successfully incorporated the needed portions of the revised Federal Criteria into its MSWLF permit
program and the revised regulations are now fully effective. Review of the finalized Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (OEPA) regulations occurred prior to the USEPA's final determination of program adequacy. After consideration
of all comments received during the public comment period, the USEPA is today issuing a final determination that the
State's program is adequate.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, the USEPA promulgated revised Federal MSWLF Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires
States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the revised Federal Criteria. Subtitle D
also requires in section 4005 that the USEPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure that facilities
comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill these requirements, the Agency has drafted and is in the process
of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal
programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. The USEPA interprets
the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval
to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to the revised Federal Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority
to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe
also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, the USEPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authority to take specific action against any owner or operator who fails to comply with an approved MSWLF permit program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA Regional offices will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation
outlined above. The USEPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. The
USEPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF permit program before it
gives full approval to a MSWLF permit program. As provided in the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA's national subtitle
D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. On October 1, 1993, the USEPA published a final ruling which modified the
effective date of the landfill criteria for certain classifications of landfills (58 FR 51536). For certain small
landfills that accept less than 100 tons of waste per day, the Federal landfill criteria were not effective until April
9, 1994, instead of October 9, 1993. The exact classifications of landfills and details on the effective date extensions
are contained in the final rule. See 58 FR 51536 (October 1, 1993).

B. State of Ohio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1993, Ohio submitted an application to obtain a MSWLF program adequacy determination. On January 14,
1994, the USEPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of the Ohio program. Further background
information on the tentative determination of adequacy appears in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59 FR 2406 (January 14, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current Ohio regulations, contained in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27), are considered
equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria. In its application, Ohio demonstrated that the State's revised permit
program would adequately meet all elements of the revised Federal Criteria. The USEPA reviewed the finalized OEPA
regulations prior to making today's final determination of program adequacy. The revised Ohio regulations were
officially adopted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 2, 1994, by the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), and the effective date of the requirements
which fully incorporate the revised Federal Criteria was June 1, 1994. The USEPA recognizes the complexity of the
rulemaking process in Ohio, and feels that an effective date of June 1, 1994, for revised State rules incorporating
the Federal Criteria is adequate. The revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OEPA regulations apply to all existing units designated by the landfill owner or operator, as well as all new units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, the USEPA announced the availability of the application for public comment
and the date of a public hearing on the application. A public hearing was held at the offices of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency in Columbus, Ohio, on March 1, 1994.

C. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA received public comment concerning the tentative determination of full program adequacy for Ohio's MSWLF
permit program. One commenter suggested that the USEPA approve the State's existing groundwater sampling and analysis
procedures with regard to the field filtration requirement currently set forth in 40 CFR 258.53. The revised Federal
Criteria require unfiltered groundwater samples to be used in laboratory analysis. Currently, Ohio regulations
require sampling and analysis procedures which ensure monitoring results that provide an ``accurate representation''
of groundwater quality. Because this is currently interpreted to require unfiltered samples, the USEPA is approving
this provision of the State's program. However, the USEPA intends to revisit this issue during a proposed rulemaking.
If the proposed rulemaking upholds the ban on field filtering, the State has agreed to continue to incorporate the
provisions of 40 CFR 258.53(b) into its policy regarding groundwater sampling and analysis procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern about the adequacy of OEPA's MSWLF permit program because it lacked provisions against
what the commenter referred to as ``strategic lawsuits against public participation.'' The commenter described
such lawsuits as preventing an individual or group from communicating their views to the government on public issues.
The revised Federal Criteria require a State/Tribe to provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement
as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. The Ohio MSWLF permit program provides three opportunities for public involvement
during the permitting process. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is delineated in the Ohio Revised Code(ORC), section 3734.05(a)(2)(d)&hyph;(f). The Ohio MSWLF program
further provides a verified complaint procedure, delineated in ORC section 3745.08, for members of the public who
are or will be aggrieved or adversely affected by a violation of the Ohio solid waste regulations. In addition, members
of the public may commence civil action against any person, the State, or a political subdivision alleged to be in violation
of the Ohio regulations by utilizing citizens' suit provisions delineated in ORC section 3734.101(A). It is the opinion
of the USEPA that the provisions detailed above and further explained in Ohio's application fulfill the requirements
of section 7004(b) of RCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter also expressed concern regarding the adequacy of various other aspects of the Ohio MSWLF program,
such as staff and financial resources for effective implementation, organizational structure of the OEPA to support
the program, and administrative costs associated with the MSWLF permitting process. In its application for program
approval, Ohio described an organizational structure with staffing and financial resources that the State feels
will be appropriate to effectively support the permitting and enforcement activities associated with its MSWLF
permitting program. The USEPA feels that Ohio demonstrated that it will be able to provide adequate resources to effectively
administer and support its MSWLF permit program. Regarding the administrative costs associated with the MSWLF permitting
process, this issue lies outside the scope of the revised Federal Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter expressed concern regarding the proper implementation of the location restrictions for wetland
areas contained in the revised Federal Criteria (40 CFR 258.12) by the Ohio MSWLF permit program. The commenter acknowledged
that the Ohio regulations incorporating the Federal Criteria for wetlands location restrictions were adequate,
however, concern was expressed regarding implementation of this provision in actual practice. The commenter specifically
referenced a site located in Richland County, Ohio, where a permit is under consideration by the OEPA for a proposed
landfill which is adjacent to the Fowler Woods State Nature Preserve. A portion of the proposed site would displace
existing wetlands and be located immediately adjacent to sensitive wetland areas of the nature preserve area. He
referred to the application of the wetland restrictions, particularly in this situation, as being arbitrary and
subject to political influence. Another commenter noted that the application of the wetland restrictions in this
case is inconsistent with the intent of the revised Federal Criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA agrees with the commenter's opinion that the Ohio regulations, as written, incorporate the wetland restrictions
adequately to ensure compliance with the wetlands restrictions contained in the revised Federal Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 CFR 258.12). In addition, the USEPA shares the concern of the commenter that all portions of the revised Federal
Criteria are implemented appropriately and uniformly in actual practice. Since Ohio has properly adopted into regulation
the location restrictions for wetland areas contained in the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA has no reason to
not approve this portion of the Ohio MSWLF permit program. However, Ohio has been formally advised of the concerns
of the commenter as well as USEPA regarding the proper implementation of the location restrictions for wetlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter expressed concern with the practice of allowing the applicant for a MSWLF permit to demonstrate
compliance with the regulations using its own contractors or consultants. The commenter noted the absence of independent
or State controlled field analysis of reports and data to confirm the accuracy of the information. The commenter also
suggested that the State should choose a consultant or contractor to perform the required demonstrations of compliance
with the regulations for individual MSWLF permit applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA shares the concern of the commenter that all information and data submitted to the State which serve to support
MSWLF permitting decisions be performed properly and accurately. The USEPA is aware of the State's practice of extensively
reviewing all submitted information and data to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. It is the opinion
of the USEPA that the procedures outlined in the Ohio application for adequacy determination will support the effective
implementation of the revised Federal Criteria. The issue of requiring independent or State chosen contractors
and consultants to provide data and information to support permitting decisions lies beyond the scope of the revised
Federal Criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the public comment, I conclude that Ohio's application for adequacy determination meets all of the
statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Ohio is granted a determination of adequacy
for all portions of its MSWLF permit program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the revised Federal Criteria independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As the USEPA explained in the
preamble to the final revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA expects that any owner or operator complying with the provisions
in a State/Tribal program approved by the USEPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria.
See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. The USEPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of
the Administrative Procedures Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's program are already in effect as a matter of State law. The USEPA's
action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply. Nor do these
requirements become enforceable by the USEPA as Federal law. Consequently, the USEPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.

Section 76.915 is used to determine whether or not a cable television system is subject to effective competition and
therefore, not subject to rate regulation under the 1992 Cable Act. If the collection of information was not conducted
under &sect;&sect;76.915(b) and (d), the potential for franchise authority error in determining the presence of
effective competition would be unchecked and could lead to deregulation of cable rates for systems not subject to
effective competition in contravention of the 1992 Cable Act. Franchising authority decisions on petitions for
change in status must be made within 30 days after the pleading cycle set for in &sect;76.915(a) closes. Franchising
authorities must notify the Commission within ten (10) days of any decision changing status. Unless the Commission
receives an opposition to such changes in status, the decision will become final 30 days after adoption by the franchising
authority.

The requirements of this section are applicable to cable operators for which the basic service tier is regulated by
local franchising authorities or the Commission, or, with respect to a cable programming services tier, for which
a complaint has been filed with the Commission. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate
adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Cable operators shall maintain their
accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the Commission.
Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application
of the Commission's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments
due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed
and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. The Commission determined
that it will include a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issues pertaining to what cost accounting and
cost allocation requirements it should adopt on a permanent basis.

Section 76.944 ensures that any participant at the franchising authority level in a ratemaking proceeding may file
an appeal of the franchising authority's decision with the Commission within 30 days of release of the text of the franchising
authority's decision. Oppositions may be filed within 15 days after the appeal is filed, and must be served on the party(ies)
appealing the rate decision. Replies may be filed 7 days after the last day for oppositions and shall be served on the
party(ies) to the proceeding. Commission review of appeals is necessary to ensure uniformity of interpretation
of these federal guidelines. Otherwise, rulings by state or local courts in different parts of the country could produce
varying and conflicting determinations about Section 623 and the Commission's Rules which could frustrate the purpose
of having federal guidelines.

Section 76.975 provides that (1) any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make commercial
channel capacity available or to charge rates for such capacity may file a petition for relief with the Commission;
(2) this petition must state concisely the facts constituting a violation of the FCC's leased access rules and the
specific rule or regulation violated, and certify that the petition for relief was served on the cable operator; and
(3) any petition for relief must be filed within 60 days of the alleged violation. A cable operator would then have 30
days from the date of filing the petition in which to respond. These requirements are designed to assure that the leased
access option brings about the intended diversity of programming and competition in programming delivery. The information
will be reviewed by FCC staff to resolved access disputes. These expedited leased access procedures may obviate the
need for oral rulings or other emergency processing of leased access disputes.

Mutual savings institutions were founded to fill gaps in the market_and for a social purpose. Commercial banks have
not always welcomed retail customers as either depositors or borrowers. Mutual savings banks were in many respects
charitable organizations designed to encourage and facilitate thrift on the part of urban wage-earners. Their trustees
were self-perpetuating groups of leading citizens, some of whom may have contributed the capital to establish the
bank in the first place, who took no fees and did no business with the bank. Savings and loan associations were essentially
cooperatives. One became a ``member'' in order to save_in order eventually to borrow the money to build a home. There
were limitations on the ability to withdraw one's funds. The right to be the next borrower, when enough funds had accumulated,
was often decided by lot. Trustees were elected by the members_and in the early days members were required to attend
meetings and take their turn as officers. The notion of ``self-help'' motivated both sorts of formations. At one time,
people spoke of the spread of these institutions as a ``movement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a legacy of that tradition, today there are approximately 1,100 mutuals in the United States. (Ten years ago there
were about 2,500, five years ago 1,775.) From time to time, one or another of them desires to convert to stock form. It
may be that they need more capital_in some cases on an urgent basis. It may be that they see expansion opportunities
and need a currency (stock) with which to acquire. For many small institutions, it makes sense to join a larger organization,
and they often need to convert to be able to do so. Based on our own research and analysis, as well as published cases,
there is also little question that some institutions have converted primarily to enrich those who controlled them.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing form of transaction by which both federal and state mutuals convert was developed by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board (``FHLBB'') in 1974. What happens, essentially, is that the mutual sells itself, for cash, to whoever
buys its newly issued stock. Various categories of potential purchasers get priority. In general, depositors stand
at the head of the line. To the extent depositors and others with priority rights do not subscribe for stock, an attempt
is made to sell it locally. If stock is still left over, it is sold to investors with no particular connection to the converting
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHLBB was conscious, when it first wrote rules for conversions, that there might be value to the right to subscribe
for stock in a conversion. For example, if a mutual with $100 million of net worth raised only $20 million of new capital
in converting, whoever got to buy the stock would have a claim on $120 million of net worth. In such a situation, the stock
would almost certainly be worth much more than the buyers had paid for it. For about a year, in the early '70s, the FHLBB
took the view that rights to buy stock in a converting institution should be distributed to its depositors, who could
either exercise and become owners or sell the rights for their intrinsic value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHLBB subsequently abandoned this approach, however, primarily out of concern that depositors would shift funds
from association to association, hoping to capture the intrinsic value of the rights when the conversion occurred_and
on a scale that could be destabilizing. At the same time, it adopted the current approach, which included an ``appraisal''
requirement, providing that a converting institution issue and sell its capital stock at a total price equal to the
estimated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
value of such stock in the converted institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of moratoria imposed in 1973 and 1974, the existing form of transaction was not tested in great numbers until
the '80s. At that point, it worked quite well, because many converting institutions had little net worth or economic
value, and the market was extremely wary even of those that did. Depositors and other investors who subscribed for
stock got securities with a market value approximately equal to what they paid for them.

Problems With the Existing Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the last two-plus years, as non-viable institutions have been closed and the industry has returned to health, the
existing form of transaction has delivered windfalls to those who subscribed. In the more than 100 standard conversions
in 1992 and 1993, the trading price at the end of the first day has exceeded the subscription price by, on average, 26%.
In 40 instances, this price increase (the ``pop'') has exceeded 30%; in 6 instances it exceeded 50%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As it has become obvious to everyone familiar with the process that buying stock in a conversion is an easy way to make
money, a class of `'professional depositors'' has emerged_wealthy individuals and investment partnerships with
$50 to $500 accounts at literally hundreds of mutuals across the country. Investment banking firms active in the conversion
arena advise us that there are perhaps 500 to 1,000 such professional depositors, and that they can take the account
list of almost any mutual in the nation and recognize hundreds of names at sight. These professional depositors buy
the maximum amount of stock allowed_and consequently the overwhelming majority of the stock issued in almost every
conversion. Market participants have told us that in a typical conversion, less than 5% of depositors participate
at all_and that the majority of them are professionals or insiders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Giving depositors the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
opportunity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to subscribe for stock has not resulted in broad distribution of stock among them. The vast majority of depositors
in mutual savings institutions keep their savings there precisely because they are risk-averse. They are likely
to read and ignore or discard the offering circular. The money they keep in a savings institution has been put aside
for retirement, or for emergencies, or for the down payment on first house, and cannot be invested in an initial public
offering. They do not participate. The existing conversion process does not benefit them at all.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As it has become obvious to everyone who understands the process that the stock of converting institutions often trades
up sharply on the first day of issue, those who control mutual institutions have become more and more interested in
converting. Managers and even non-executive trustees have been awarded free stock and options (at the subscription
price). Employee Stock Ownership Plans (``ESOPs'') have been created and given priority in buying stock. These and
other devices have resulted in substantial transfers of value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As it has become clear that most conversions would be oversubscribed, the ``allocation'' process has clearly been
subject to abuse. For example, we have been told that in transactions where allocations were likely to be based on size
of deposit because of expected oversubscription, insiders and others in a position to know the relevant record date
have been able to transfer large amounts of money into their accounts on that single day. Where the right to subscribe
has been limited to long-term depositors, or depositors with local addresses, we are told that professionals are
sometimes able to persuade other depositors to ``front'' for them (despite rules to the contrary).

trading up), the integrity of the appraisal process has been compromised. The FDIC's experience with appraisals
is that they typically follow a certain pattern. A ``peer group'' of stock savings institutions is identified. (How
they were selected out of the much larger universe of potential ``peers'' typically is not well explained.) The peer
group market/book ratio is calculated. It is then stated that the converting institution should be valued (on a pro
forma basis) at a discount from that ratio. Two reasons for this are typically given. The first is that the converting
mutual is actually inferior to the peer group_which raises the question, why were they chosen as peers in the first
place. The second, discussed below, is the need for a ``new issue discount.'' (Price/earnings ratios are also calculated,
but there is rarely a cogent analysis of the converting institution's earnings potential once it appropriately deploys
its new capital.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At March 31, 1994, the thrift industry average market/book ratio was 99% and the median was 95%. (At year-end 1993,
those figures were five percentage points higher, a year before that 15 percentage points lower.) The market tends
to value recently converted institutions below the industry average_primarily, in our judgment, because the return
on a newly converted institution's book, or capital, will be low by industry standards until it is able to leverage
the new capital it raises in the conversion. During 1992 and 1993 as a whole, the average market/book ratio of a newly
converted institution, at the end of the first day of trading, was 72%. To meet the ``appraisal'' requirement that
an institution's stock trade at what it was sold for in a situation where a 72% market/book ratio was a reasonable expectation,
a mutual would have to more than triple its capital base. To be precise, a mutual with a $100 million net worth would need
to raise $257 million (ignoring expenses and the effects of establishing an ESOP or a management retention plan),
since 72% of $357 million (the resulting book value) equals $257. It is extremely hard for a company in a highly competitive
industry prudently to employ that much new capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What appraisal firms did, in 1992 and 1993, was to ``appraise'' converted institutions on average at 57% of book. They
did this despite the fact that, on average, these institutions traded up the first day by 26%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appraisers' principal rationalization for this discrepancy has been that, in the context of an initial public offering,
a ``new issue discount'' is required. While it is certainly true that it is difficult to bring a company public without
pricing the shares at a level that stimulates unfilled demand_resulting in a ``pop''_we question the magnitude required
in an environment where virtually all conversions are trading up. In some circumstances, the need for a ``new issue
discount'' has been asserted in appraisal updates issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
after
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the end of the subscription period, and in the face of 100&hyph;300% oversubscriptions. We would also observe that
the literal language of the OTS regulations and guidelines on conversion appraisals does not allow for a market discount.
The question to be answered is: how much stock has to be sold to eliminate any ``pop''?

We suspect that the practices we describe developed over time as appraisers, and mutuals and their advisers, attempted
to deal in good faith with the inherent contradictions of, on the one hand, a form of transaction perfectly suited to
institutions on the brink of failure, or which the market feared, and, on the other, a thrift industry that has returned
to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a footnote to the conversions of the 80's, it is worth observing that many institutions which emerged with very high
capital ratios were so anxious to earn a good return for their new, demanding stockholders, that they grew their balance
sheets more quickly than they should have and took risks they did not fully understand. A total of 77 New England savings
banks converted in the years 1984 through 1989; these transactions increased their weighted average capital ratio
to 15.2% from 6.6%; 16 of them (or 21%) subsequently failed.

 In addition, the rush by converted institutions to increase assets quickly tended to reduce credit standards throughout
the market, imperiling other institutions.

Changing the Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What this history demonstrates is the need for fundamental change: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``appraisal'' process puts the government in the awkward position of substituting its judgement for that
of the market... 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull; .&blank;.&blank;. and forces most converting institutions to raise far more capital than they can prudently
deploy... 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull; .&blank;.&blank;. but still fails to eliminate windfalls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This has put well-intended individuals involved in more than a few conversions in the ethically uncomfortable
position of pretending the appraisal requirement is met when they know it isn't. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The required form of transaction transfers the existing value of the mutual to a small group of individuals
with the cash, sophistication and risk appetite to buy the stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because value is being ``given away,'' the process invites insider abuse. And because the value has to go somewhere,
the ingenuity of market participants eventually frustrates attempts to eliminate the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We share with others a desire to address problems arising under the existing rules. We do not in any way want to prevent
valid conversions from taking place_nor encourage conversions that fail to meet a valid business need. We also desire
that our handling of conversions be generally consistent with that of the OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons we are publishing elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proposed rule which: (a) reaffirms our intention to review conversion applications submitted by state-chartered
nonmember insured savings banks (and applications for insurance from newly established associations to be owned
by mutual holding companies), and (b) explicitly establishes certain criteria which are comparable to those of the
OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, we feel it is only fair to put the public on notice that we believe it may be difficult for a healthy mutual

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop a sound business plan while raising enough new capital to receive a valid appraisal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The noted investment manager, Peter Lynch, describes this problem, and the existing form of conversion generally,
in graphic terms. Buying stock in a converting mutual, he writes, is like going to an automobile dealer to buy a car,
giving him a check for the purchase price, and discovering on the way home that the dealer has put your check in the glove
compartment of the car. Unless the car is an extraordinary lemon, this is bound to be a good deal. And increasing the
size of the check_which is what ``disciplining the appraisal process'' amounts to_won't make it stop being a good
deal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that the recent OTS amendments (and the requirements in the FDIC proposed rule mentioned above) which
aim to give long-term, local depositors more rights_but within the framework of the existing form of transaction_may
produce similarly frustrating results. As noted earlier, ``real'' depositors are not going to benefit, no matter
what priorities they receive, because ``real'' depositors still may not subscribe in significant numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that ``insider abuse,'' which is the focus of much recent discussion and of several of the OTS amendments
and the requirements of the FDIC proposed rule, is only a piece of the problem. In one recent conversion, for example,
state authorities forced the institution to rescind stock grants which would have benefited insiders by approximately
$40 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This was laudable. But the ``pop'' in the price of the converted institution's shares benefited those who subscribed
by more than $200 million on the first day of trading and by $275 million after one month's trading. All who had their
subscriptions filled were depositors_but only 5% of all depositors subscribed. We question whether it can be an adequate
response to the trustees' fiduciary duty to deliver that much value to the tiny fraction of a mutual institution's
depositors with the capacity to line up and collect it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We continue to believe_as stated in testimony before the Congressional Banking Committees_that the conversion
process is fundamentally flawed. Thus, in addition to the proposed rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (which is intended to address concerns within the existing mutual-to-stock conversion framework) we also are issuing
this request for comments seeking views on an approach which might address the basic flaws in the existing scheme.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The (Misguided) Question of ``Ownership'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most vexing question facing everyone who has ever dealt with mutual-to-stock conversions is: ``Who owns mutuals?''
That may be the wrong way to ask the question. As indicated earlier, mutuals were originally closer to charities or
community organizations than to commercial enterprises. As a by-product of doing what they were founded to do, they
have accumulated net worth. The trustees hold that value in trust. The right question more likely should be: ``If the
trustees decide to convert, to whom should that value be delivered?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe there are two ways to answer the question: leaving it to the trustees in the reasonable exercise of their
fiduciary duty, or legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leaving the decision to the trustees is logical, but may be impractical. The best argument in favor of this approach
is that the history and circumstances of institutions vary, that boards are designed to balance competing interests
and considerations, that existing law should be adequate to prevent abuse, and that the government should not interfere
unless it has to. As different boards of trustees wrestle with the issues, a consensus should 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
tend
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to emerge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The argument against leaving the decision to the trustees is twofold. Taking the positive view of such boards, it places
an unfair burden on them and their institutions. They will be lobbied by potential claimants. Someone will object
to whatever decision they make. Taking the skeptical view_and there is no question that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
some
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 boards have interpreted their fiduciary responsibilities rather loosely_leaving the decision to the trustees
is unwise. The FDIC will in the end have to expend significant resources providing informal guidance to the conscientious
and making sure that trustees' determinations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
are
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some could well believe that the preferable way to answer the question of ``to whom the value should be delivered''
would be legislation. In fact, the main purpose of this notice and request for comments is to solicit views from the
public on a legislative proposal that the FDIC could prepare and present to the appropriate legislative body(ies).
Legislation could take the form of state law, through which each state would decide the question for the mutual banks
it charters (or has chartered), or federal legislation, through which the Congress decides the issue on a nationwide
basis. Uniformity argues for federal legislation, but questions of federal preemption of state law would have to
be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If federal legislation is decided upon, the Congress could either establish in the statute explicit value-distribution
rights or authorize the appropriate federal agency (presumably, the FDIC for state savings banks and the OTS for federal
and state savings associations) to determine to whom the value of the mutual institution should be delivered.

Who Should Get the Value? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are aware of at least seven groups (in no particular order) which might lay a claim to a mutual's value: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Depositors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Other creditors, including holders of subordinated debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Employees_whether through the medium of an ESOP, which acquires shares in the conversion, or other arrangements
designed for senior management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund, the U.S. Treasury or the relevant state government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Charitable organizations or trusts serving the community and purposes for which the converting institution
was originally founded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of who receives the value is primarily a political one. Accordingly, we do not believe the FDIC should
be the one to decide among these (or other) claimants. We have a supervisory interest in seeing the question answered,
however, and answered in a way that is generally seen to be sensible and fair.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Pending a legislative determination of this question, we also have a supervisory interest in ensuring that the boards
of mutual institutions fulfill their fiduciary duties in preserving the value of the institution. Accordingly,
the FDIC will continue to review proposed conversion transactions of state mutual savings banks and take appropriate
action where the transaction raises fiduciary concerns.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Taking each of the seven parties in turn, we believe that at least some of the value will have to go to depositors. Although
the law of many states implies that they are not ``owners'' of mutual institutions in the classic sense of the term,
and, at least since the creation of the FDIC, they have not borne significant risk, they have supplied the institution
with its resources and in many cases have a vote on conversion. Although we have scant sympathy for those professional
depositors who have opened small accounts in the expectation of large windfalls and whose hopes would be disappointed
by the reforms we propose, it is perhaps the case that some depositors of all types have known that conversion was a possibility,
and in a sense may have ``bargained for'' at least some share of the value of the institution. The fact that existing
OTS regulations and most states' laws give savings and loan association depositors preference in subscribing for
stock may not create an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
entitlement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but it has probably created an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
expectation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_which will probably have to be satisfied to some degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Among
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 depositors, there are questions of allocation: by size, by tenure, by address. What is theoretically desirable is
often beyond the scope of the converting institution's data processing systems. Attempts to favor ``local'' depositors
can be frustrated in various ways. There is also the question of record date_and the problem of long-term depositors
who unwittingly close their accounts shortly before the record date. Our current inclination would be to make the
record date fairly recent (as a convenience) and to award one share of the aggregate value going to depositors for each
year that each account has been open. We expect that allocating shares to accounts closed prior to the record date,
while theoretically equitable, would prove impractical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to depositors, creditors are uninsured and do take risk_especially since the adoption of federal depositor
preference. On the other hand, most creditors have that status as an incident of some other relationship_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as a supplier of goods and services_and would be surprised (if delighted) to discover that it gave them any claim on
the value of the institution. We would therefore expect a consensus to emerge favoring their exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The argument for giving debtholders part of the value is stronger. They have the position they do because of a conscious
financial transaction. In most cases, such debt is subordinated and does represent capital. Debtholders, while
subordinating themselves to depositors for a higher rate of return, did not ``bargain for'' any share of the mutual's
net worth_but neither did most depositors. Were it to be established that subordinated debtholders were entitled
to a share of the value, it might make it slightly easier for small mutuals to raise debt capital, which has appeal from
a safety and soundness standpoint. As an equitable approach and from our perspective as insurer, we would favor giving
debtholders some of the value of a converting institution, and we would not expect such a decision to strike people
as unreasonable or unfair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such a decision is made, we believe the most feasible method of allocation is by size of holding, with debtholders
as a whole receiving a share of the value going to debtholders and depositors combined that is proportionate to debt's
share of the institution's combined liability to depositors and debtholders. The length of time the debt has been
outstanding, or in any particular holder's hands in the case of tradable debt, should not, in our judgement, have bearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Home Loan Bank advances are an important part of the liability structure of many banks. The question arises:
if other debtholders should receive some of the value of a converting institution, why not the relevant Federal Home
Loan Bank? We believe there is a good reason for excluding them: the fact that advances are fully secured, making the
Banks effectively senior to depositors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although borrowers are technically ``members'' of some mutual savings institutions, we believe most borrowers
think of the institution as having a claim on them, rather than the reverse. During that period when they are borrowers,
they are in fact already receiving a benefit. Borrowers are typically required to open deposit accounts as well. Finally,
borrowers' loans can be, and often are, sold to third parties; distinguishing their rights from those of borrowers
whose loans have not been sold would present formidable legal and logistical challenges. For all these reasons, we
do not believe the consensus would be to give them a claim, as borrowers, on the value being transferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would point out, however, that at least some knowledgeable observers view the rights of depositors to a share of
the converting institution's value as not really that much stronger than those of borrowers. The vast majority of
both groups do business with mutuals on an arms-length basis, at market terms, at no significant risk, and with no expectation
of a windfall. In the view of some observers, it is only the absence of any other ``owners,'' the fact that depositors
turn up on the side of the balance sheet where stockholders would be if there were any, and the practice of treating depositors
as stand-ins for owners that give depositors the presumption of a right to receive value.

Rewarding Employees and Managers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is sometimes said that managers_and to a lesser degree employees_of mutual institutions enjoy more job security
and a less demanding work environment that their counterparts at organizations subject to stockholder discipline,
but are in turn less well compensated. Conversion changes their situation. Some argue that these considerations_and
years of loyal service_entitle managers to a share of the value. The opposing view is that managers of mutuals chose
to work there and ``bargained for'' whatever pay they got. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We understand both sets of arguments. The no-entitlement view, if we can call it that, has logical purity. The view
that managers deserve part of the value has emotional appeal, especially when they have spent decades at the converting
institution. The issue of appropriate treatment of long-serving employees is a good example of the essentially political
nature of the value-distribution question.

Were we required to decide this issue without legislative guidance, we would prefer to see all benefits to employees
of insured institutions be delivered as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
compensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would certainly endorse the creation of an ESOP immediately after conversion. If the conversion process has entailed
extra effort on the part of some (or all) employees, they may be entitled to bonuses. And if conversion entails a radical
reduction in job security, it may be appropriate to adopt a severance policy consistent with standard industry practice
for stock institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Focussing on the top few executives and non-executive trustees, it is certainly the case that their jobs become harder
and less secure following conversion. They may be entitled to significant raises. It may be appropriate for a few senior
executives to receive employment contracts. Again, all such steps should be evaluated within the context of ``compensation.''
We believe that for individuals who control the conversion transaction to lay any claim, in their capacity as managers
and trustees, to a portion of the value being transferred creates a conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is currently common practice for converting institutions to create stock option plans. We believe it is appropriate
for stock institutions to have incentive compensation plans of this type. As indicated in the FDIC proposed rule mentioned
above, we agree with the OTS that such plans should, at the earliest, be adopted at the first stockholders' meeting
following conversion and that the exercise price for any such options should be set at that time, rather than being
based on the conversion price. The latter practice, which had been common, gave those who controlled the transaction
an incentive to underprice the shares, and masked transfers of value to those executives receiving options, which,
if properly measured, and viewed as compensation, would have been deemed excessive.

A ``Government'' Share? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several individuals and organizations have suggested that a share of the existing value of converting mutuals should
go to one of the deposit insurance funds, or to the U.S. Treasury, or to the government of the state which chartered the
institution. We are uncomfortable with the first suggestion. Converting institutions have been paying premiums,
just as stock institutions have. No one would lay claim to a portion of the latter's net worth. The FDIC should not do
so with regard to mutuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some have advanced the argument_based on the cost of the savings and loan crisis_that taxpayers generally, through
the medium of the Treasury, should get a portion of the value that conversion releases. As a fairness matter, we believe
this argument is flawed: Institutions now converting have 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 cost taxpayers anything. Most state savings banks, whose conversions fall under our jurisdiction, are insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund, which taxpayers have not had to support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another argument for conveying the value of converting mutuals to the government_whether state or federal_is that
``no one owns them,'' and that the fairest course is therefore to avoid giving the value to anyone in particular. We
will have more to say on this topic later in this Notice, but would observe that if the form of transaction suggested
below is adopted, many of those who receive the value of the institution will get cash, and will pay taxes on it as income,
giving government its ``share.''

Fulfilling Mutuals' Original Purpose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated earlier, mutuals were created for reasons that have now largely disappeared. Ordinary citizens have
plenty of places to put their savings. A host of private- and public-sector entities facilitate home-ownership.
The trustees of a mutual savings institution having regard for their fiduciary duties might liken their situation
to that of the board of the March of Dimes, which had to redefine its mission after polio ceased to be a major threat. From
that perspective, it may be appropriate for a portion of the value of a converting mutual to be transferred to one of
more community organizations or charities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This approach raises the question, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
organizations?''_which could be extremely hard to answer. As with the matter of dividing up the value in the first
place, leaving the decision to the trustees places a burden on them. Nevertheless, under this approach, the trustees
are the ones to decide. If no appropriate vehicles existed, a trust might be established to receive the transferred
value and make grants over time. The responsibility for allocating funds is borne by thousands of trustees of colleges
and hospitals and foundations and charities all over the country; there are plenty of examples to follow_and laws
to prevent abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative to endowing a new or existing charitable organization is for the converted institution to accept special
obligations to serve the convenience and needs of the community for banking services. This is a very broad subject,
which we are not prepared to explore exhaustively here. We would make three basic points, however. First, while all
banks clearly have public obligations, it seems likely that imposing different burdens on institutions which are
otherwise direct competitors will ultimately create safety and soundness concerns. For that reason alone we would
oppose this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the value transfer inherent in an institution's voluntary acceptance of a special obligation to the community_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a promise to make affordable housing loans, or to open branches in distressed neighborhoods_is difficult to measure
against immediately cashable value delivered to depositors or others. We think it would be difficult for trustees
to know what they'd actually done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the history of mutual savings banks does suggest that organizations to which any portion of the value of a converting
institution might be transferred should be locally focussed, and should have the encouragement of self-help as a
major objective. To give only two of many possible examples, helping to capitalize a community development bank,
or establishing a day care facility which permitted single mothers to work, would have satisfying historic resonance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
No Entitlement; No Forced Conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The idea that some of the value of a converting institution should be delivered to the ``community'' it was chartered
to serve is as strongly opposed by some as it is supported by others. This is another excellent example of the political
(rather than regulatory) character of the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At least two arguments against a ``community'' share have been advanced. The first is that the ``wrong'' charities
and community organizations would be chosen_wrong from the speaker's point of view, that is_because of their skill
and persistence in lobbying the board. The second is that such organizations, seeing latent wealth available, would
put pressure on boards to convert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This second argument is also advanced, as it was in the early '70s, against giving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
depositors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transferrable rights: if value is ``available,'' they will put pressure on institutions to convert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Being 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exempt 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
from constituent ``pressure'' is unhealthy for any organization. Legislators have to face the voters. Independent
agencies are subject to oversight. Stock organizations can be taken over. We do not believe that the trustees of mutuals
should be allowed to ignore completely the views of those the institution exists to serve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, we would emphasize that however one decides the value-distribution issue, that does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
answer the (misguided) question, ``Who owns a mutual?'' It does not, in our view, give anyone standing to demand that
an institution convert_any more than a group of private citizens could demand that the Red Cross ``convert''! Conversion
is a decision for the trustees, and until they make such a decision, the FDIC will not get involved_except where inadequate
capital makes it desirable from a safety and soundness standpoint. Mutuality has a distinguished history in America.
In the aggregate, mutuals have cost the FDIC proportionately less than have stock institutions. We would not endorse
a system that compelled mutual institutions to change their character.

New Form of Transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Having adopted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
answer to the question, ``Who gets the existing value?'', the problem of delivering that value is easier to address.
We would suggest the following approach: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The trustees decide how much capital they need to raise as a business matter. (There is no ``appraisal'' process.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The trustees hire underwriters to conduct an initial public offering_and an escrow agent for the purposes
described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Rights to subscribe for the stock of the converted institution are distributed to ``rightholders'' in accordance
with the principles outlined above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each of these rights will have value. For example, if a mutual with $100 million of net worth elected to raise
$20 million, and distributed 4 million rights to buy 4 million shares (at $5 each), and the market valued the converted
institution at 80% of resulting book (or $96 million), the shares would trade at $24 each, and the right to buy a share
for $5 would be worth $19. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The rights would be ``transferrable'' only in the sense that, at the end of the subscription period, the escrow
agent would exercise on behalf of any rightholder who had not done so, turn the stock over to the underwriter for sale,
give $5/share of the proceeds to the company and send the difference to the rightholder.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is likely, under this form of transaction, that very few rightholders would chose to exercise, and that the underwriters
would essentially be selling the whole institution. This gives rise to several questions. For example, wouldn't
the transaction costs be awfully high, relative to the amount of new capital being raised? The answer has to be yes_but
the cost should be measured relative to the major strategic accomplishment of conversion itself; presumably there
was a reason to convert, or the trustees wouldn't have undertaken it. It is also worth observing that the need (opportunity)
to sell nearly 100% of the stock will lead many more underwriting firms to compete for the business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another question is why not just distribute stock certificates instead of rights? The basic answer is that the selling
effort of a public offering is what gets the market to focus on the fair value of the shares, and gets a group of underwriters
committed to make a market in them afterwards. A direct distribution of shares could saddle the bank with an uneconomically
large number of shareholders. It would leave unsophisticated holders of small numbers of shares in danger of being
persuaded to sell at prices below intrinsic value. Finally, to the extent that rights were distributed to a community-oriented
charity, a stock sale should probably be required to avoid leaving a controlling block of stock in the hands of a foundation
or organization which might be governed by the directors of the converted mutual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One argument advanced against this form of transaction is that the existing process has raised enormous amounts of
money to recapitalize ailing thrifts, and that while the industry is healthy now, we may need to be able to do that again
some day. True_but the approach here proposed would be able to do that as well. If a thrift with a low equity ratio wanted
to convert, it could distribute rights and hire an escrow agent and an underwriter, just the same. The shares could
be priced wherever they had to, to be sold. The rights just wouldn't have much value_but that would appropriately reflect
the institution's perilous condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another argument advanced is that the recent market is a highly unusual one, that the embarrassing increases in share
price on the day of conversion have already begun to shrink and could soon disappear. They may or may not_and ``pops''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
though on a more modest scale, are effectively a requirement of the initial public offering market_but the transactions
the existing conversion process requires would still be inefficient to the point of being improper. Under current
rules, a well capitalized thrift is only able to avoid a ``pop'' by increasing its equity ratio to the point where its
market/book ratio falls below industry norms_which says that a lot of the new capital will either be underutilized
for several years, or used imprudently. What all parties at interest should want is the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
highest 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market/book ratio that can be obtained, because that suggests the right business judgements have been made regarding
capital structure and growth prospects. The elimination of ``pops'' would suggest a destruction of the value the
trustees hold in trust, and a violation of their fiduciary duty of care_regardless of who that duty is owed to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Merger Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS interim final rule would prohibit merger conversions_whereby a stock institution acquires the assets and
assumes the liabilities of a mutual with no significant payment to anyone_except where the survival of the converting
institution is in question. The form of transaction we here propose would permit merger conversions, but would make
them essentially a purchase of subscription rights by the acquiror, with the value paid for the rights_either in cash
or other consideration_going to rightholders. This would have efficiency benefits for those smaller institutions
whose decision to convert flowed from a decision to affiliate with a larger organization. Trustees who decided to
convert and be acquired would of course have the same obligation to get the best possible price for rightholders.

Mutual Holding Companies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act
of 1989 authorized conversion of mutual savings institutions into federal mutual holding companies, which in turn
transfer virtually all their assets and liabilities to new, stock savings institutions, part of whose stock is acquired
by subscribers in the conversion, with the majority retained by the mutual parent. This structure has the benefit
of permitting converting institutions to raise only the amount of new capital they actually need. It has, however,
in our view, potential for even a higher level of insider abuse than in standard conversions. We note that many newly
formed mutual holding companies propose to refuse dividends declared by their operating subsidiary_with no corresponding
change in their percentage ownership of the subsidiary as dividends flowed to its minority stockholders. It seems
to us that this could constitute a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the trustees_which would be particularly
acute were the trustees significant stockholders of the subsidiary. (It is worthy of note that ``pops'' in conversions
involving mutual holding have been in the 40% range, compared to 26% for standard conversions.) As our suggested form
of standard conversion would eliminate the need to raise excessive amounts of capital, we believe use of the mutual
holding company structure should be discouraged in future conversions.

Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we have studied the mutual-to-stock conversion process, it has become clear that there are two intertwined problems
to be solved. One is technical: how to do it? The other is political: who should get the value? The first problem is interesting
and challenging, but the second one is fundamental.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deciding who should get the value makes a lot of people uncomfortable. Almost every answer makes someone angry. As
we read the history, the FHLBB settled on the existing form of transaction precisely because it allowed them to avoid
answering the value-distribution question. We have come to believe that the primary appeal of some value-distribution
schemes_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, giving it to depositors or to ``the government''_is that they appear to disperse value enough to make the issue moot.
As we have discussed the subject over the past two months, we have observed how tempting it is to continue to avoid it.
Lawyers and investment bankers and professional depositors with a vested interest have urged us to drop the subject_which
is not surprising. But even disinterested individuals wind up asking, ``Do we care?''_and they reach that point with
remarkable consistency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We should care. The integrity of a banking system is a national treasure. Careless distribution of the value of converting
institutions undermines that integrity. A form of transaction in part designed to avoid the value-distribution
question_though it worked well for a while_today forces well-meaning bankers and lawyers and trustees and regulators
to wink at polite fictions. Many have suggested that this is hardly a crime, since there is no victim. We disagree. Honor
is the victim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life is full of compromises. There is no ``right'' answer to the value-distribution question. But there is a right
process for addressing it. We invite broad participation in fashioning a compromise, as only democracy can, with
which no one is entirely satisfied, but in which all can take pride.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Should a mutual institution be required, as a threshold issue, to demonstrate a need to convert_or is it sufficient
that it provide an adequate business plan for the future?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the absence of legislation, could and should the FDIC adopt guidelines or set standards for the distribution
of the existing value of a converting institution, or could or should the matter be left entirely to the trustees?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether it is legislation or the FDIC or the board of trustees that sets standards, what should they be? Who should
get some of the value, how much, and how specific should the rules be?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If depositors (or creditors or borrowers or employees) are to receive some of the value, how should it be allocated
among them? Should amount of deposit or tenure of association be accorded more weight? Must depositors and debtholders
be treated identically? What practical constraints exist, based on mutuals' information systems and resources?
What should the record date be?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If charitable organizations or foundations are to receive a portion of the value, how should the suitability of
the recipients be determined? Should there be a presumption that the trustees' selection of recipients is reasonable?
Do there need to be rules to prevent abuse of such entities_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, through ``consulting contracts'' with trustees? Should such entities be required to sell at the time of conversion,
or should they be permitted to diversify over time, in accordance with existing federal tax and banking laws?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Does ``pressure to convert'' from parties who would receive value if an institution did so represent a legitimate
public policy concern? How great might that pressure be? How can trustees of institutions which have not elected to
convert be protected from unreasonable litigation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) What potential problems (including tax issues and insider abuses) are there with the proposed new form of transaction,
and how can they be avoided or alleviated? On the assumption that the market will gradually improve on any form of transaction,
how specific does legislation or regulation need to be in that area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Should converting institutions (including those doing merger conversions) be required or encouraged to obtain
``fairness opinions'' from independent financial advisors? Should the FDIC attempt to ``police'' the market judgements
involved in the process in any way?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Should new mutual holding company creations be permitted? If not, how should existing ones be regulated?

<DOCTITLE>Banco Bilbao; Acquisition of Company Engaged in Permissible Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, S.A., Bilbao, Spain (Applicant), a foreign banking organization subject to the Bank Holding
Company Act (BHC Act), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act and  225.23(a)(2) and (3) of the Board's
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(2) and (3)), to retain an interest in its indirect subsidiary, Probursa International
Incorporated, New York, New York (Company), and thereby engage in the following securities-related activities:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) providing investment advisory services pursuant to  225.25(b)(4) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.25(b)(4));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) providing full service brokerage services pursuant to  225.25(b)(4) and (b)(15) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)
and (b)(15)), including exercising investment discretion on behalf of institutional customers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) buying and selling, on the order of customers, all types of securities as a riskless principal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) engaging in the private placement of all types of securities as agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.'' This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, ``closely related to banking.'' Second, the Board must find in a particular
case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may be reasonably be expected to produce
public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board previously has determined by regulation that the proposed investment advisory and full-service brokerage
activities are closely related to banking under section 4 of the BHC Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4) and (b)(15). Applicant has committed that it will conduct these activities in accordance with
the Board's limitations and restrictions on the conduct of such activities. The Board also has previously determined
that the proposed riskless principal and private placement activities are closely related to banking, subject to
certain prudential limitations on the conduct of such activities which address the potential for conflicts of interest,
unsound banking practices, and other adverse effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

private placement activities subject to the conditions and limitations contained in these and other Board orders
approving these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition and
by providing a wider range of services and added convenience to Company's customers. Thus, Applicant believes that
the proposed activities will result in benefits to the public that would outweigh any adverse effects associated
with the proposal.

In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.

Part H, Chapter HN (National Institutes of Health) of the Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations
of Authority for the Department of Health and Human Services (40 FR 22859, May 27, 1975, as amended most recently at
59 FR 25952&hyph;25953, May 18, 1994) is amended to reflect the reorganization of the nutrition research coordination
function within the NIH. The reorganization consists of (1) transferring the functions of the Division of Nutrition
Research Coordination (DNRC) from the Office of Disease Prevention (ODP), Office of the Director, NIH (OD/NIH),
to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); (2) abolishing the DNRC within the
ODP, OD/NIH; and (3) establishing the Division of Nutrition Research within the NIDDK. The transfer of the nutrition
coordination function is consistent with Title VI of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;43) which
reiterates the lead role of the NIDDK in nutrition and obesity research and mandates an expanded NIDDK role in the coordination
of trans-NIH nutrition research and translation efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 706 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary)
appoints the Council every 4 years. The Council examines issues affecting the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which were created under
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary has asked the Council specifically to address the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Social Security financing issues, including developing recommendations for improving the long-range financial
status of the OASDI programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;General program issues such as the relative equity and adequacy of Social Security benefits for persons at
various income levels, in various family situations, and various age cohorts, taking into account such factors as
the increased labor force participation of women, lower marriage rates, increased likelihood of divorce, and higher
poverty rates of aged women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing these topics, the Secretary suggested that the Council may wish to analyze the relative roles of the
public and private sectors in providing retirement income, how policies in both sectors affect retirement decisions
and the economic status of the elderly, and how the disability insurance program provisions and the availability
of health insurance and health care costs affect such matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council is composed of 12 members in addition to the chairman: Robert Ball, Joan Bok, Ann Combs, Edith Fierst, Gloria
Johnson, Thomas Jones, George Kourpias, Sylvester Schieber, Gerald Shea, Marc Twinney, Fidel Vargas, and Carolyn
Weaver. The chairman is Edward Gramlich. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council is to report to the Secretary, and such reports shall thereupon be transmitted to the Congress and to the
Board of Trustees of each of the Trust Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Agenda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council will discuss: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Economic well-being of today's elderly and those soon to retire; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prognoses for baby-boom cohorts and beyond; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Issues facing the Social Security program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Issues concerning pensions and other retirement saving; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Matters relating to technical panels of experts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting is open to the public to the extent that space is available, beginning at 1:00 p.m. on June 24, 1994. That
day's morning session will deal only with internal personnel and administrative matters of the Council not relating

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior (Department) has developed this two-year interim policy to implement the requirements
of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADR Act), Public Law No. 101&hyph;552. This interim policy also addresses
the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, Public Law No. 101&hyph;648. The Department is adopting this interim policy to allow
time to acquire data on the applicability of ADR techniques to selected program disputes. During this interim period,
the Department through its bureaus and offices will implement ADR pilot programs and other program initiatives in
an effort to establish a baseline of experience in the practical uses of ADR. At the conclusion of this interim phase,
the Department will assess the results of the ADR initiatives in conjunction with both external and internal comments
received, develop a proposed final policy, allow for public comment, and publish a final ADR policy in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Department seeks comments from the public, including, among others, those persons whose activities the Department
regulates, on any aspect of this interim policy and its implementation, and those persons who have engaged in or may
in the future engage in ADR processes with the Department. At the end of the 60 day comment period the Department will
consider issues raised by interested persons and may modify the interim policy based on public comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Administrative Dispute Resolution Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADR Act), Public Law No. 101&hyph;552, 5 U.S.C. 581&hyph;583, enacted
November 15, 1990, authorizes and encourages federal agencies to employ consensual methods of dispute resolution
as alternatives to litigation. Under the ADR Act, a federal agency is required: (1) To designate a senior official
as a dispute resolution specialist; (2) to establish training programs in the use of dispute resolution methods;
(3) to adopt a policy on the use of ADR techniques; and (4) to review the standard language in agency contracts, grants
or other agreements, to determine whether to include a provision on ADR. Federal agencies are also required to consult
with the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
(FMCS) on the development of their ADR policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, section 3(a) of the ADA Act requires the Department to adopt a formal policy as to how it intends to implement
the ADR Act in each of the following areas: (a) Formal and informal adjudications; (b) rulemakings; (c) enforcement
actions; (d) issuing and revoking licenses or permits; (e) contract administration; (f) litigation brought by or
against the Department; and (g) other departmental action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress enacted the ADR Act to reduce the time, cost, inefficiencies and contentiousness that are too often associated
with litigation and other adversarial dispute mechanisms. Moreover, experience at other federal agencies shows
that ADR can help achieve mutually acceptable solutions to disputes more effectively than either litigation or administrative
adjudication. In fact, Vice President Gore recommended in September 1993 that federal agencies ``increase the use
of alternative means of dispute resolution.'' National Performance Review, Recommendation REG06 (September 7,
1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
While ADR techniques have proven to be useful in resolving serious conflicts, the day-to-day operations of the Department's
bureaus should provide conflict avoidance methods, where possible. Moreover, the ADR Act, 5 U.S.C. 582(b), specifically
cautions that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agency shall consider not using a dispute resolution proceeding if_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) a definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and such a proceeding
is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures
before a final resolution may be made, and such a proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy
for the agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are
not increased and such a proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) the matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the proceeding;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) a full public record of the proceeding is important, and a dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide such a
record; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) the agency must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the
matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the agency's
fulfilling that requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The decision whether to use ADR, however, remains within each federal agency's discretion, and participation in
ADR processes is by mutual consent of the disputants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ADR Act fosters the use of ADR by ensuring appropriate protection of parties' and neutrals' communication. The
ADR Act, however, is not a statute exempting disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). To establish
a baseline of understanding, concerned parties should establish confidentiality guidelines consistent with FOIA
requirements before entering into negotiations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the limitations set forth in the ADR Act, and elsewhere, the Department plans to explore, over the next two years,
whether and in which contexts the use of ADR facilitates fairer, faster, or more rational resolutions of disputes
than present dispute resolution methods provide. Additionally, the Department will conduct an evaluation of the
interim policy. On the basis of this evaluation, the Department will consider modifying any of its current procedures
or rules, as appropriate, to allow for greater use of ADR.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Negotiated Rulemaking Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In enacting the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, Public Law No. 101&hyph;648, Congress indicated its concern that traditional
notice and comment rulemaking procedures may discourage agreement among the potentially affected parties and the
Federal Government. Congress addressed this concern by purposefully designing the Negotiated Rulemaking Act's
procedures to facilitate the cooperative development of regulations by interested persons and agencies. Moreover,
Vice President Gore's report recently recommended improving agencies' regulatory systems by ``[e]ncourag[ing]
agencies to use negotiated rulemaking more frequently in developing new rules.'' National Performance Review,
Recommendation REG03.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negotiated Rulemaking (Reg-Neg) does not replace the traditional notice and comment rulemaking. Rather, Reg-Neg
supplements the more traditional process by developing consensus around the candidate proposed rule before an agency
publishes it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Combining early consensus-building and information-gathering with an opportunity for broad public consideration,
the Reg-Neg process meets the prescription of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and can facilitate more effective regulatory development and regulations. Moreover, on September 30, 1993, President
Clinton issued a Memorandum in conjunction with the issuance of Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and
Review. The Memorandum required each department to identify to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
at least one rulemaking within the upcoming year to be developed through negotiated rulemaking or to explain why negotiated
rulemaking would not be feasible, 58 FR 52391 (Oct. 7, 1993).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decisionmakers should view Reg-Neg as one of a variety of information-gathering and consensus-building or consultative
processes used to achieve effective, efficient, rational, and fair agency policy. Although the Negotiated Rulemaking
Act does not address less formal decisionmaking processes, including, among others, policy roundtables and public
meetings, such nonadversarial processes may help gather information to assist the Department in policy development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation in informal regulatory development processes can require significant commitment of resources on
the part of all participants, including federal agencies. The Department's experience, however, has shown that
consensus-building techniques can result in better policy, reduce the high rate of litigation, and lower the costs
of program implementation for the Department's bureaus and the regulated community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Interim Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Application of the Interim Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department encourages the effective use of ADR and Reg-Neg to the fullest extent compatible with existing law,
and the Department's resources and missions. Based on almost one hundred and fifty years of experience, the Department
recognizes that the use of consensus-building techniques and nonadversarial planning processes can increase the
wisdom, efficiency, equity, and long-term stability of departmental decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim policy is intended to govern both the programmatic side of the Department's broad responsibility, as
well as many of the human resources aspects. With regard to human resources, this interim ADR policy embraces the ADR
policy of the Department's Office for Equal Opportunity. The use of ADR is expected to be very useful in matters involving
equal employment opportunity. Workplace dispute issues outside the jurisdiction of actions governed by regulations
issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board will also be governed by this policy. Where the use of ADR would impede
effective supervisory action in routine matters of employee discipline or performance appraisal, supervisors
may elect not to use ADR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose of the Interim Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has developed a two-year ADR interim policy in response to the requirements of the ADR Act. The policy
encourages the Department's bureaus to identify disputes amenable to ADR and to use ADR, whenever practicable. After
testing ADR methods in a variety of contexts, the Department, through the Interior Dispute Resolution Council, at
the conclusion of the two-year interim phase, will assess the appropriateness of the use of ADR and determine which
program areas could most benefit from the institutionalization of ADR processes. Existing bureau ADR efforts should
continue as this final policy is developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's interim ADR policy is also designed to disseminate knowledge about ADR both within the Department
and to those whom the Department serves, as well as to introduce new ADR initiatives and to provide guidelines for bureaus
to apply in the implementation of ADR pilot programs. These initiatives will produce a baseline of experience that
will be used in developing the Department's final ADR policy. Without the full commitment and cooperation of all involved
in the two-year interim phase, the Department will lose a valuable opportunity to learn what works, what does not,
and how best to capture potential benefits from ADR use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Implementation of Interim Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Role of the Department's Dispute Resolution Specialist
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the ADR Act, the Secretary appointed the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to serve as the
Department's Dispute Resolution Specialist (DRS). This high level, Department official was appointed as the DRS
in order: (1) To facilitate intra-departmental coordination and communication; (2) to ensure consistent, quality
training; (3) to establish minimum qualifications for mediators, arbitrators, and certain departmental employees
with ADR responsibilities; and (4) to reduce administrative redundancy. The DRS will maintain an ``open door'' policy,
welcoming inquiries from and offering assistance to the bureaus and interested persons. During the period that the
interim policy is being implemented, ongoing input from the public is encouraged. The DRS will also develop and make
available a roster of neutrals who are trained in ADR and who would be available to participate in a dispute resolution
proceeding. Despite this focal point for ADR activity, the Department's interim ADR policy is to encourage decentralized
decisionmaking to the greatest extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Role of the Interior Department Resolution Council
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to keep the Department's bureaus informed during the implementation of the interim phase, the DRS shall,
30 days after publication of the Department interim policy, convene the Interior Dispute Resolution Council (IDRC).
Composed of the Department's Assistant Secretaries, Solicitor and the Director of the Office of Regulatory Affairs
(ORA), or their respective designees, and chaired by the DRS, the IDRC shall monitor and evaluated the Department's
use of ADR and Reg-Neg and assist in intradepartmental policy and process coordination. The IDRC shall act as an information
clearinghouse, recommend personnel training courses in ADR techniques and program design, and act as the liaison
between the ACUS and FMCS.

Additionally, the IDRC will consider the benefits of appointing a departmental ombudsman and the benefits of appointing
an ombudsman for selected departmental bureaus. An ombudsman could serve the following functions: (1) To address
specific categories of workplace disputes through the investigation of the circumstances giving rise to the disputes
and based on their findings to recommend corrective actions, if appropriate; or (2) to investigate and propose the
resolution, if appropriate, of citizen complaints against the Department, including recommendations for changes
in agency structure or organization to better address or avoid persistent problems. The IDRC will submit a written
report at the end of the Interim period on the use of an ombudsman.

3. Training in ADR
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes, consistent with the philosophy of the National Performance Review, that bureaus can
best evaluate and develop specific ADR programs and initiatives to meet bureau needs. Therefore, each Bureau Head
shall appoint a Bureau Dispute Resolution Specialist (BDRS). The BDRS shall receive training recommended by the
DRS in ADR consensus-building techniques, conflict resolution, and program design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DRS shall recommend appropriate BDRS training, such training to be completed no later than 60 days following issuance
of the interim policy. Additionally, the DRS shall provide ADR training opportunities for selected groups of senior
managers of the Department, whose job responsibilities include determining or influencing how disputes will be
managed. The DRS will also identify opportunities for advanced training in facilitation and mediation for judges
and attorneys within OHA, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Development of Bureau Alternative Dispute Resolution Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BDRS shall develop and submit the Bureau's Alternate Dispute Resolution Plan (ADRP) through the Bureau Head to
the appropriate Assistant Secretary no later than 60 days following the completion of training. The ADRP shall include
at least one category of disputes amenable to ADR methods, and a discussion of how the bureau will implement ADR to address
such disputes. Additionally, to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the bureau's initiative(s), the ADRP
should address, among other topics, the (1) Goals; (2) objectives; (3) timetable; (4) implementation strategy;
(5) monitoring criteria; and (6) evaluation methodology. It is permissible if two or more bureaus adopt the same plan
or parts of a plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting appropriate ADR pilot initiatives, a bureau can focus, for example, on a particular category of dispute
(e.g., contract cases), on a variety of disputes involving a particular organizational segment or region of the agency,
or on a particular ADR process that would be applied in a variety of disputes across the bureau. In selecting a focus
for an ADR pilot initiative, the Department encourages bureaus to consider using some of the disputes that are central
to the Department's mission. While a bureau should not avoid identifying personnel and small contract disputes,
for example, as candidates for a pilot initiative, a bureau should not focus exclusively on these areas so that the
effectiveness of ADR for a bureau can be judged in a programmatic context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some offices of the Department, such as the Office of the Solicitor, assist bureaus in carrying out their programs
rather than conducting programs of their own. For the purposes of this policy, such offices should assist their client
bureaus in implementing ADR in a programmatic context. Nonetheless, such offices should develop an ADRP for internal,
human resource management purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the many activities and functions of the Department and the Federal Acquisition Regulations' (FAR)
recognition of the usefulness of ADR in government contracts, each BDRS, or appointed designees, should review categories
of all proposed new and renewal contracts, agreements, permits, memoranda of understanding, and other documents,
to determine whether to include ADR provisions. Moreover, the Department encourages the use of ADR in contract disputes
prior to these disputes reaching the Interior Board of Contract Appeals. To avoid duplication of effort by bureau
personnel, the Office of the Solicitor, working with the Department's Senior Procurement official, will develop
standardized ADR-related clauses that bureaus can use in contracts and other documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects, as well, that those bureaus with comparatively more dispute resolution experience will,
on a voluntary basis, assist bureaus less familiar with dispute resolution in the development of the ADRP. The Department
expects, as well, that inter-bureau initiatives such as ``one stop permitting,'' for example, be coordinated with
the BDRSs. Each BDRS and others involved with the implementation of the interim policy are encouraged to consult with
other federal agencies, and others in the dispute resolution field in the development of their ADR initiatives. The
DRS is available to provide the names of contact persons within various federal agencies who have effectively utilized
ADR methods in resolving disputes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Judges within all boards and divisions of OHA will be encouraged to utilize, where appropriate, ADR methods, including,
among others, the use of settlement judges, minitrials, and the referral of litigants to mediation or arbitration
in advance of a judge's consideration of a case on the merits. OHA will develop an internal policy for the appointment
of settlement judges and will refer litigants to a list of approved mediators and arbitrators.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appropriate Assistant Secretary or designee shall, upon receipt of a bureau's ADRP, review and approve the ADRP
in consultation with the IDRC. Within 30 days after approval of an ADRP, a bureau shall publish its ADRP in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

D. Monitoring and Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each BDRS shall monitor the implementation of his or her bureau's dispute resolution initiatives on an ongoing basis,
using the criteria developed in their ADRP. Each BDRS shall submit to the IDRC, through the proper Bureau Head and Assistant
Secretary, every 180 days, an evaluation of the bureau's progress toward meeting the goals, objectives, and timetables
on the basis of the methodology outlined in the ADRP. The evaluation should also discuss any unanticipated issues
that each bureau may have encountered and how those issues have been or are being resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BDRSs in conjunction with the IDRC shall, at the conclusion of the two-year interim phase, catalogue and evaluate
the bureaus' respective initiatives and experiences under their ADRPs in a report to the Secretary. This evaluation,
coordinated by the DRS, as chair of the IDRC, will focus on the categories of dispute and types ADR methods that were
most helpful in achieving resolution of disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, because the usefulness of ADR to the Department is dependent on the processes' ability to facilitate rational,
fair, efficient, and stable solutions among the Department's bureaus, the regulated community and the public, evaluation
of the interim policy should receive the benefit of public public comment and participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A concluding section of the evaluation should explain how dispute resolution will be integrated on a permanent basis
into each bureau's program offices. This process of review, evaluation, and modification will allow each bureau
to systematically and regularly improve its ADR programs.

E. Development of Final ADR Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IDRC in conjunction with the BDRSs, and with the benefit of public comment and participation, will develop a permanent
Department ADR policy on the basis of the Department's two-year interim policy experience. The DRS will be responsible
for the coordination of the development of the Department's final policy, and shall ensure issuance of that policy
no later than 90 days after the conclusion of the interim policy. During the time between conclusion of the interim
policy and issuance of the final policy, the interim policy shall remain in effect, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Negotiated Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Presidential Memorandum on Negotiated Rulemaking, issued September 30,
1993, the Department will use, where appropriate, negotiated rulemaking or other consensus-building techniques
to develop rules that are fair, technically accurate, and clear. Each bureau will evaluate, prior to drafting or amending
any regulation, whether negotiated rulemaking is appropriate for developing or amending that regulation and will
explain, on the Regulatory Alert Form submitted to the ORA, the basis for determining whether or not the regulation
will be developed or amended using negotiated rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In explaining whether negotiated rulemaking should be used for a particular rulemaking, each bureau should address
at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there exists a small and identifiable group of constituents (the ``parties'') with significant interests
in the rulemaking, so that all reasonably foreseeable significant interests can be represented by individuals in
the negotiation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the parties believe it to be in their best interest to enter into a negotiated rulemaking; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the parties are willing and able to enter into negotiated rulemaking in good faith; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Whether any single party has, or is perceived to have, the ability to dominate negotiations, thereby making a compromise
solution unlikely; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Whether there are clear and identifiable issues that are agreed to be ripe for a negotiated solution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Whether a negotiated solution would require one or more parties to compromise a fundamental value; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Whether the use of negotiated rulemaking is reasonably likely to result in an agreement or course of action satisfactory
to all parties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Whether there are legal deadlines or other legal issues that either mitigate against negotiation or provide incentives
to reach a negotiated solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a bureau has decided to enter into a negotiated rulemaking, it will prepare a brief report describing the goals,
objectives, anticipated parties, and projected timetables of the negotiation. Throughout the negotiation, the
bureau will prepare brief periodic reports discussing the progress toward achieving the goals, objectives, and
timetables of the negotiation, and highlighting any successes and unanticipated events or issues encountered during
the negotiation. These reports shall be submitted to ORA and the IDRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the end of the two-year interim policy, ORA, the DRS, and IDRC shall prepare a report to the Secretary evaluating
the Department's experiences with negotiated rulemaking. This report will focus upon the types of policies, categories
of rulemakings, and methods of negotiation that were most successful in achieving customer satisfaction and the
cost-effective implementation of mutually agreeable rulemakings. This report will be based upon evaluations conducted
by the bureaus and submitted to ORA, IDRC, and the DRS for review and assimilation into the report to the Secretary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Involves the use of neutrals acceptable to all parties to determine disputed facts. This can be particularly useful
where disagreements about the need for or the meaning of data are impeding resolution of a dispute, or where the disputed
facts are highly technical and would be better resolved by experts. Fact-finding usually involves an informal presentation
of its case by each party. The neutral(s) then provide an advisory opinion on the disputed facts, which can be used by
the parties as a basis for further negotiation.

abbreviated versions (usually no more than a few hours or a few days) to senior officials for each side with authority
to settle the dispute. This process allows those in senior positions to see firsthand the relative strengths and weaknesses
of their cases and can serve as a basis for more fruitful negotiations. Often, a neutral presides over the hearing,
and may, subsequently, mediate the dispute or help parties evaluate their cases.

interest. The participants join voluntarily in a temporary relationship to educate each other about their needs
and interests and exchange specific resources or promises that will resolve on or more issues. Almost all of the ADR
procedures, in which the parties maintain control over the outcome of the conflict, are variations upon or elaborations
of the negotiation process.

Appendix II_Examples of ADR Initiatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Various bureaus and offices within the Department have been involved in implementing ADR processes. Some of the more
prominent examples of ADR initiatives that reflect the Department's commitment to ADR include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, the Department disseminated to each of the Department's bureaus and offices an ADR survey designed to identify
program areas that could be amenable to ADR techniques. Among the questions asked were: (1) The categories of disputes
in which the organization is typically involved; (2) the number of cases during the prior 2 fiscal years that were (a)
docketed, (b) settled, and (c) litigated, and the approximate cost involved; and (3) the organization's experience
to date in utilizing ADR techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department conducted an orientation program on ADR. Included in the orientation program was Senator Charles
Grassley, one of the sponsors of the ADR Act, together with representatives of the Administrative Conference of the
United States (ACUS) and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department conducted a one day training program on ADR. The training focused on the various methods of ADR and included
representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health
and Human Services, and the Department of Transportation, each of whom shared their experiences in developing successful
ADR programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) provided training in basic and advanced mediation skills for
OEO and personnel program officials and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselors. OEO also issued a directive
to bureaus and offices providing guidance on the development and implementation of ADR pilot programs consistent
with 29 CFR part 1614. Under this directive each bureau and office is to submit an ADR pilot program plan delineating
specific actions to be taken to incorporate ADR techniques into the EEO complaints process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recently made consideration of the use of ADR in the resolution of discrimination complaints mandatory
and has designated a Departmental EEO/ADR Coordinator and directed each bureau to designate a Bureau EEO/ADR Coordinator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department designated the Bureau of Reclamation as a pilot bureau in FY&hyph;93 for the purpose of testing the
effectiveness of mediation in the resolution of EEO complaints and administrative grievances. The Bureau has relied
exclusively on contract neutrals to serve as mediators for all dispute referred for ADR. Mediation has also been utilized
by Reclamation in other program areas, including resource management and contract administration. Reclamation
is assessing the results of its mediation program to determine whether to expand its usage to other program areas.

The Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals has implemented ADR as an alternative to administrative litigation.
The Board of Indian Appeals and the administrative law judges vested with authority for adjudicating Indian probate
cases have encouraged the use of settlement agreements to resolve these matters. Under 43 CFR 4.207, administrative
law judges have been authorized to effect compromise settlements in probate actions where the parties concerned
agree to compromise and where the judge establishes that all necessary conditions have been met. The Board of Contract
Appeals has been effectively implementing ADR processes over the last 2 years in its cases. At the time a case is docketed,
the Board issues an order notifying the parties to the dispute of the availability and benefits of ADR. Through actively
promoting ADR as a viable alternative, the Board has settled a majority of its cases without the need to conduct a hearing.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has recognized the benefits of ADR techniques, and a presentation on the topic
was made at the Bureau's Solid Minerals Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in April 1993. The BLM, in partnership
with the Bowie State University's Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution, has provided basic Conflict Management
ADR training to Personnelists and EEO practitioners, as well as to key management officials. The BLM will continue
to work with the Center for ADR and other outside resources to provide training during Fiscal Year 1994.

The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a rich history of ADR. The MMS's examples include (1) a process targeted
at settling outstanding and contentious mineral royalty claims which has reduced appeals and litigation and increased
royalty collections, and (2) more than a decade of conflict resolution training for offshore minerals management
personnel and establishment and conduct of a joint review panel for constituent review of environmental documents.

The Bureau of Mines (USBM) has recognized the benefits of ADR techniques and has provided training to principal officials
in the use of ADR techniques. Training was provided by a contractor for the Directorates of the Bureau on orientation
to ADR techniques; Information and Analysis on September 28, 1993; Finance and Management, December 8, 1993; and
Research on January 11, 1994. Training will also be provided to EEO Counselors by the EEO Staff and the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service in June 1994. The Bureau plan to continue the use of ADR for EEO complaints and to expand it
to other types of disputes. The EEO Office has used mediation and negotiation for EEO complaints in the precomplaint
stage and also the formal complaint stage.

effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 24, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide procedures
for dealers to seek exemptive relief from rule G&hyph;37, in limited circumstances, and to clarify certain definitions
in rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. The Board has requested accelerated approval of the proposed rule change to facilitate
compliance with rule G&hyph;37. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the propose rule
change from interested persons. As discussed below, the Commission finds good cause for granting accelerated approval
of the proposed rule change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is filing the proposed rule change to amend rule G&hyph;37 concerning political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business, and rule G&hyph;8 concerning recordkeeping. The proposed rule change: (i) Provides
procedures for dealers to seek exemptive relief from rule G&hyph;37's prohibition on business, in limited circumstances;
and (ii) clarifies certain definitions in rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. The Board has requested accelerated approval
of the proposed rule change to facilitate compliance with the rule.

In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

In response to the Board's initial proposal on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities

 the Board received a number of comments recommending that the Board consider providing, in limited instances, a ``good
faith exemption'' to the rule's prohibition on municipal securities business.

 In light of these comments, the Board has determined to submit the proposed rule change.

A number of commenters on rule G&hyph;37 have expressed concern that imposing a prohibition on municipal securities
business may be unfair in certain limited situations when political contributions have been made.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 For example, a disgruntled municipal finance professional may make a contribution purposely to injure the dealer,
its management or employees. Also, a municipal finance professional eligible to vote for an issuer official may make
a number of small contributions during an election cycle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, over four years) which, when consolidated, amount to slightly over the $250 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, $255). In both examples, the contributions would trigger the prohibition on business under rule G&hyph;37(b),
thereby prohibiting the dealer from engaging in municipal securities business with the issuer for two years.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board recognizes that in certain circumstances, such as those discussed above, the rule's prohibition on business
may be too harsh a consequence for truly inadvertent contributions or the contributions of disgruntled employees.
Thus, the Board has determined to add new paragraph (i) to rule G&hyph;37 to establish a procedure whereby the National
Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') and the federal bank regulatory agencies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation),
upon application by a dealer subject to such association's or agency's inspection and enforcement authority, may
exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, a dealer who is prohibited from engaging in municipal securities business
from such prohibition.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In determining whether to grant such an exemption, the proposed rule change would require that the NASD and bank regulatory
agencies consider, among other factors, whether:

The NASD and the bank regulatory agencies are statutorily authorized to inspect for compliance with, and to enforce
Board rules. See Sections 15A(b)(7), 15B(c)(5), and 15B(c)(7) of the Act; [15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;78o&hyph;3(b)(7),

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors and the purposes of this rule;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) such dealer (A) prior to the time the contribution(s) which resulted in such prohibition was made, had developed
and instituted procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with this rule; (B) prior to or at the time the
contribution(s) which resulted in such prohibition was made, had no actual knowledge of the contribution(s); (C)
has taken all available steps to cause the person or persons involved in making the contribution(s) which resulted
in such prohibition to obtain a return of the contribution(s); and (D) has taken such other remedial or preventive
measures, as may be appropriate under the circumstances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that a dealer that is subject to the prohibition on business should have to make a substantial effort
to be exempted from that prohibition. The proposed rule change would require the dealer to petition the NASD or appropriate
bank regulatory agency to seek such an exemption and to provide sufficient evidence to justify an exemption. In making
a determination concerning an exemption, the NASD or appropriate bank regulatory agency would then review the facts
and circumstances presented by the dealer, as well as the factors set forth in the proposed rule change. The Board would
expect that this prohibition exemption not be routinely requested by dealers and that exemptions would be granted
by the NASD and the bank regulatory agencies only in limited circumstances. The Board believes that the proposed rule
change will offer relief from the prohibition on business in appropriate circumstances without sacrificing the
rule's purpose and intent, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to ensure that the high standards and integrity of the municipal securities industry are maintained, to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to perfect a free and open
market, and to protect investors and the public interest. The Board will seek information from the NASD and bank regulatory
agencies regarding the granting of any exemptions in order to monitor the implementation of this provision, and to
determine if any changes are necessary.

Definition of ``Official of an Issuer''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ``official of an issuer'' is defined in rule G&hyph;37(g)(vi) as any incumbent, candidate or successful candidate
for elective office of the issuer, which office is directly or indirectly responsible for, or can influence the outcome
of, the hiring of a dealer for municipal securities business. The definition is intended to include any state or local
official or candidate (or successful candidate) who has influence over the awarding of municipal securities business,
including certain state-wide executive or legislative officials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board, however, was concerned that because the definition focuses on ``an elective office of the issuer,'' it
did not clearly include certain other officials. For example, a state may have certain issuing authorities whose
boards of directors are appointed by the governor. Although the governor is an official with influence over the awarding
of municipal securities business, the governor, in this illustration, is not an incumbent or candidate for ``elective
office of the issuer'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the state authority). Thus, a contribution to the governor would not prohibit a dealer from engaging in business with
the state authority. The Board intended to include the governor as an official of the issuer in such circumstances
and, therefore, has determined to amend the definition to clarify its intent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended definition of official of an issuer includes any incumbent or candidate ``for any elective office of a
state or of any political subdivision, which office has authority to appoint any official(s) of an issuer, as defined
in [paragraph (g)(vii)(A) of rule G&hyph;37].''

The definition of ``municipal securities business'' in rule G&hyph;37(g)(vii) includes certain dealer activities,
such as acting as negotiated underwriters, financial advisors and consultants, placement agents, and negotiated

dealers from acting as competitive underwriters or competitive remarketing agents.

 The Board is amending this definition to clarify that the rule also would not prohibit dealers from engaging in competitive
advisory activities.

Rule G&hyph;37(e)(i) currently requires dealers to submit quarterly reports to the Board on Form G&hyph;37 concerning
political contributions and municipal securities business. The Board is concerned, however, that some confusion
could arise over whether particular reports were actually sent and/or lost in the mail. To obviate any such problem,
the Board is amending this paragraph to require that dealers send such reports to the Board ``by certified or registered
mail, or some other equally prompt means that provides a record of sending.'' This will ensure that dealers have a record
of all reports submitted to the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also is amending this paragraph to correct an erroneous cross-reference to rule G&hyph;8, which requires
dealers to submit to the Board reports on contributions that are required to be recorded pursuant to rule G&hyph;8(a)(xvi).

Paragraph (e)(ii) of rule G&hyph;37 requires that the reports referred to in paragraph (e)(i) include, among other
things, a list of issuers with which the dealer has engaged in municipal securities business, along with the type of
municipal securities business and the name, company, role, and compensation arrangement of any person employed
by the dealer to obtain or retain municipal securities business with such issuers. The Board intended that this provision
apply to persons such as outside consultants that are not municipal finance professionals associated with the dealer.
Thus, the amendment clarifies that this requirement does not require the dealer to disclose the name of such municipal
finance professionals.

Board rule G&hyph;8(f) allows dealers, other than bank dealers, who are in compliance with Commission Rule 17a&hyph;3,
on recordkeeping, to be deemed in compliance with Board rule G&hyph;8, on recordkeeping. However, the rule provides
that specific information required by rule G&hyph;8 must be maintained, even though such information is not required
by Rule 17a&hyph;3. The Board is amending rule G&hyph;8(f) to clarify that dealers complying with Rule 17a&hyph;3
are still required to maintain the information and records required by Board rule G&hyph;37.

In addition, the board is amending rule G&hyph;8(f) to include appropriate cross-references to rules G&hyph;27

This amendment, like the proposed rule change, clarifies that dealers complying with Rule 17a&hyph;3 must still

 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and

The Commission received several comments to rule G&hyph;37 recommending that the rule provide an exemption process,
based on the dealer's compliance procedures and supervision, for certain inadvertent violations.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission approved the rule and recommended the MSRB separately address these concerns by filing a proposed
rule change that provides an exemption process for inadvertent violations. The MSRB's proposal adequately addresses
these concerns.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal provides procedures for dealers to obtain exemptive relief from rule G&hyph;37's prohibition on business
where, for example, covered persons inadvertently make contributions that slightly exceed the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
exemption provided by the rule. The proposal's exemptive relief is based on the dealers' supervision of covered persons,
compliance procedures concerning rule G&hyph;37, and corrective and remedial action concerning inadvertent violations.
The Commission expects that dealers will apply for exemptive relief only in certain, limited situations. Thus, the
proposal provides an exemptive process to rule G&hyph;37 without providing dealers a ``loop-hole'' that would frustrate
the rule's purpose to, among other things, ensure that high standards and integrity of the municipal securities industry
are maintained.

The proposal also clarifies provisions of rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. Amendments to rule G&hyph;37's definitions
of ``official of an issuer,'' ``municipal securities business,'' and ``municipal finance professional,'' as well
as amendments to rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8 disclosure and recordkeeping requirements will facilitate compliance

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 24, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide
interpretative guidance concerning rule G&hyph;37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities
business. The Board, pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, filed the proposal as constituting a stated policy,
practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the
Board. This renders the proposal effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

Guidance and Recommended Requirements For Airport Surface Movement Sensors, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
provides recommended standards for both sensor and system characteristics. The primary purpose for these sensors
is to operate stop bars located on taxiways which provide entrance to low visibility runways. The sensors may also
be used for other low visibility functions such as taxiway light sequencing, runway exiting notification and presence
detection. This document provides guidance to airport system designers, manufacturers, installers and user. The
cost of DO&hyph;221 is US$50.00 for U.S./Canada/Mexico and US$65.00 for all other countries, plus applicable shipping
and handling charges.

Guidelines on AMS(R)S Near-Term Voice Implementation and Utilization, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contains operational guidelines and recommendations for the implementation and utilization of Aeronautical Mobile
Satellite (Route) Services, voice communication functions in the near-term (circa 1993&hyph;1996) air traffic
environment. It presents a system-level view of how satellite voice services can be implemented and used in the Air
Traffic Services (ATS) and Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) environments inclusive of aircraft installation
requirements, ground infrastructure requirements and available AMS(R)S services. This document defines the functions
and performance needed to facilitate the development, implementation, certification and operational use of satellite
voice in an environment where satellite voice communication is not yet a required capability for air navigation.
It uses as its basis the existing standards for satellite avionics and ground equipment. It should be useful to designers,
manufacturers, installers and operators of equipment used in AMSS voice service. The cost of DO&hyph;222 is US$60.00
for U.S./Canada/Mexico and US$75.00 for all other countries, plus applicable shipping and handling charges.

1. Develop the midfield area for aviation-related industrial users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Expand the existing cargo apron and buildings west of the existing terminal building to accommodate a minimum of
26 cargo aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Extend Runway 7/25 to a length of 10,000 feet by constructing a 3,500-foot southwesterly extension with parallel
and connecting taxiways and associated lighting and navigation aids. This would include the installation of a CAT
II Instrument Landing System (ILS) for Runway 7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Relocate approximately 12,000 feet of Belt Line Road and 9,300 feet of Kishwaukee Road.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Expand the existing terminal building and auto parking lot and upgrade the existing airport entrance roadway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Construct a general aviation apron and T-hangars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Close Runway 13/31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Remove miscellaneous support buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Construct a new 4,000-foot general aviation visual approach runway, parallel to and 5,100 feet southeast of existing
Runway 7/25, with associated taxiways and instrumentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Construct and realign various taxiways parallel to Runway 1/19. The majority of the realignment work proposed
is adjacent to and west of the approach end of Runway 19.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Implement actions recommended in the 1993 Master Drainage/Stormwater Management Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Implement actions recommended in the updated Noise Compatibility Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Acquire approximately 1,100 acres of land for airfield development. In addition to this acquisition, is the relocation
of up to 28 residential dwellings (for noise and floodway mitigation), of which only eleven are considered to be noise
impacted and must be acquired and residents relocated prior to the start of any operation resulting from the Proposed
Action Alternative. The remaining residential dwellings would be acquired for purposes of airfield development
and floodway mitigation. Those dwellings identified as floodway mitigation can be acquired either in fee-simple
or through restrictive covenant. (Updated)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Compensate for wetland impacts caused by the development of the Proposed Action Alternative through the creation
of approximately 25 acres of new wetlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. An additional 1,500 flights annually beyond those originally forecasted but with an greater number of stage three
aircraft. This is based on UPS's proposal to initiate an air cargo operation at Greater Rockford Airport.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 24, 1994, the Commissioner of Customs directed that Customs develop an Automated Export System (AES).
This system is being developed as a cooperative team effort involving Customs and the Bureau of the Census.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since AES is in the very early design stage, the AES Development Team intends to hold a series of public meetings for
the purpose of: (1) Giving Customs managers an opportunity to provide the public with information related to the development
of AES and (2) giving attendees an opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide Customs with informal
ideas related to AES design and functionality. Each meeting will open with a short presentation on AES, past, present
and future, and after this presentation the floor will be open to all attendees for general informal discussion of
the AES program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first meeting will be held in Washington, D.C. on Friday, July 8, 1994, commencing at 9:00 a.m. in Hearing Room B
of the Interstate Commerce Commission Building. In order to ensure that overcrowding does not result, persons planning
to attend the meeting are requested to preregister by contacting Lorna Finley, AES Development Team, preferably
by FAX (202&hyph;927&hyph;0742) or, for those without access to FAX equipment, by telephone (202&hyph;927&hyph;0280).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional public meetings on AES are planned for the following locations: Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New
York; Houston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles, California; and Portland, Oregon.
Appropriate notice will be published in the

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This NOFA announces the availability of funding for activities under the Vacancy Reduction Program. Under this program,
certain public housing agencies (PHAs) are required to develop and submit a plan regarding vacancies in units owned
or operated by the PHA. Assessment teams have conducted on-site assessments of the vacancy situation at known eligible
PHAs, and when notified will conduct an assessment at any PHA that meets the eligibility requirements but has not been
assessed. In addition, when requested, HUD will provide assistance to any eligible PHA in developing its vacancy
reduction plan. Although funds available under this NOFA will be used to implement the plans, these funds are intended
to supplement other initiatives of the PHA that will reduce the rate of vacancies in a PHA's inventory. The NOFA contains
information on the following:

A portion of the funds available for this program will be used for travel and administrative expenses of the assessment
teams, as authorized by Section 115 of the 1992 Act. Of the remaining amount, no PHA applying for funding under this
NOFA may receive more than 15 percent of the total available funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subject to this 15 percent limitation, eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) that are Comprehensive Improvement
Assistance Program (CIAP) agencies will be provided funding in the full amounts approved for Vacancy Reduction Program
activities. For PHAs that are Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) agencies, if insufficient funds remain to fund all
eligible and approved activities under this NOFA, the amount to be reserved for each CGP agency will be its pro rata
share of the total remaining funds available, in accordance with Section I.J(3) of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All units that are funded in whole or in part by the Vacancy Reduction Program must be brought into compliance with the
Housing Quality Standards (HQS), as set forth in 24 CFR 882.109, and must be readily marketable when the work is completed.

C. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to gain greater insight into the vacancy problems of the PHAs required to participate in the Vacancy Reduction
Program, the Department sent a survey form on April 2, 1993, to all PHAs that, based on HUD data bases, were troubled
or mod-troubled on January 1, 1993, or had a vacancy rate that exceeded 15.9% on that date. Of the 400 identified PHAs,
345 responded to the survey. These PHAs reported a total of 56,324 vacancies, about half of the total vacancies nationally.
The responses showed that additional funding was necessary to cure only half of the vacancies in the inventories of
the responding PHAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of those vacant units whose occupancy was not dependent upon additional funding, the reasons for and percentages
of the total vacancies were as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ready, awaiting leasing_5.7%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No demand (defined as few or no persons on the waiting list)_3.5%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Undesirable (defined as requiring 4 or more offers to obtain a tenant, but not requiring funding)_2.0%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Funded under a modernization program_29.7%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In litigation_6.5%; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other reason not requiring funding_3.2%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of those units in which vacancies could be eliminated with additional funding, the reasons for and percentages of
the vacancies were as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Awaiting demolition_5.4%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Needing modernization_30.0%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Needing repair_12.8%; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other reason requiring funding_1.1%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the vacant units that would benefit from additional funding, the estimated costs of rehabilitation (exclusive
of any costs for lead-based paint testing and abatement) and percentage of total vacancies were as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Up to $5,000_4.8%; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;$10,000&hyph;25,000_7.1%; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Over $25,000_13.8%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, almost 20% of all vacancies in these high-vacancy PHAs could be remedied for a cost of $10,000 or less per unit,
plus the cost of any lead-based paint activity, essential management improvements, Section 504 (of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973) rehabilitation, or other essential costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks maximum efficiency in the use of Vacancy Reduction Program funds. To this end, the Department
met with public housing interest groups and resident representatives on January 28 and July 9, 1993, to discuss the
needs of public housing that might be met by this program. As a result, the Department has decided to focus this NOFA
on units that can be rehabilitated for occupancy at a modest cost, and on units with more expensive rehabilitation
costs where the PHA has the ability and agrees to provide the remainder of the funding necessary to prepare the property
for occupancy. In this way, the Department hopes to house the optimal number of additional families using the available
program funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey has enabled the Department to proceed with vacancy assessments (see 24 CFR 968.410 in the final rule published
elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the preamble of the proposed rule, published at 58 FR 29728) for those PHAs that responded to the survey and indicated
an inventory of unfunded vacant units. Other PHAs that did not receive a survey form or did not respond to the survey,
but that believe they are eligible under this NOFA and wish to apply for funding, must notify the Department so that
an assessment can be scheduled as indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the beginning of this NOFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Vacancy Reduction Program is not designed to focus solely on the rehabilitation of vacant units; the program also
is intended to identify and correct site and management deficiencies as necessary to achieve and sustain occupancy
of vacant units. Management problems in some of the high-vacancy PHAs also may be responsible for vacancies. These
problems may include high turnover, poor maintenance and security, delays in making units ready for occupancy after
they are vacated, delays in placing tenants in units as soon as they are ready, or inability to deal with marketability
problems that could be addressed successfully. Therefore, management improvements that are necessary for a PHA
to achieve and maintain a high level of occupancy and to manage turnover successfully also will be funded under this
NOFA. The vacancy assessments will assist the PHAs and HUD in identifying what actions need to be taken in this regard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some PHAs may have difficulty preparing an application, including a vacancy reduction plan. The Department will,
on request by the PHA, assist the PHA in preparation of the plan. Such assistance may be requested by telephoning Strategic
Resources, Inc. (703) 749&hyph;3040. Moreover, if an application submitted in response to this NOFA is technically
approvable under the NOFA, but is deemed by HUD to need improvement or supplementation in specific areas of the PHA's
plan to increase the potential for success, HUD will require changes in the plan before execution of the amendment
of the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).

Eligible unit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a dwelling unit that satisfies the conditions under either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this definition,
as applicable. The unit must be either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vacant unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that meets the characteristics of both of the following paragraphs (1) (a) and (b): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The cost of rehabilitation necessary to make the unit available for occupancy and marketable (including development-wide
physical improvements and other necessary costs, but not including costs of lead-based paint activity, costs for
accessibility for those with disabilities, and management improvement funding) is either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) $8,000 or less, when averaged with other vacant units in the development for which the PHA is applying for this category
of funding (i.e., average of not more than $8,000 per unit); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) More than $8,000, when averaged with other vacant units in the development for which the PHA is applying for this
category of funding (i.e., average of more than $8,000 per unit), and the PHA has available funding that it agrees to
use to pay the costs in excess of $8,000 per unit. ``Available funding'' includes funds legally available to the PHA
by September 30, 1994; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The unit will be marketable when it has been made ready for occupancy. Units that cannot be made marketable, for
any reason, are not eligible to be funded under this NOFA, and funds should not be requested for them in the application.
Such units, however, must be included in the vacancy reduction plan; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupied unit, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The unit meets the criteria of paragraphs (1)(a)(i) or (ii) and paragraph (1)(b) of this definition, and either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In order to address the overall vacancy situation at a PHA, it is necessary to move a resident family to another unit.
The unit vacated by that family may then be considered an eligible unit. For example, if a PHA has vacant one-bedroom
units for which there is no demand, but also has overhoused families that could be transferred to the one-bedroom units
(thus freeing up larger units for which there is a demand), the PHA could request funding under this NOFA for both units;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The unit is expected to be vacated under the Moving to Opportunities Program; or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The PHA has fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, and the PHA had expended
funds on rehabilitation of the unit in reasonable anticipation of reimbursement from Vacancy Reduction Program
funds. The PHA may be reimbursed for the cost of the rehabilitation only if funds remain available after HUD has funded
all other eligible costs at all PHAs applying for funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Number and percentage of units expected to be occupied by each semiannual date after the submission of the PHA's
vacancy reduction plan, as provided under paragraph (3) of this definition, including date of full occupancy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Source of funding and expected percentage of funds to be obligated and expended by each semiannual date, as provided
under paragraph (3) of this definition; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Expected date of any demolition or disposition, and the number of units involved in this activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A schedule, by chart or time line, indicating milestones for vacancy reduction activities (all vacant units must
be included regardless of whether they require funding and whether they have already been funded). The schedule shall
indicate all actions that will have been taken as of the end of each semiannual period, either September 30 or March
31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Actual calendar dates shall be used for units that do not require vacancy reduction program funding, but will be
funded from sources within the control of the PHA (e.g., CGP and the operating budget) or have already been funded by
another governmental program (e.g., CIAP, the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For units for which specific calendar dates cannot be given because approval from HUD is a prerequisite to the
action, the schedule shall specify semiannual dates from the expected HUD approval (e.g., first semiannual reporting
date after approval, second semiannual reporting date after approval, etc.). Such units include those for which
the PHA is requesting or intends to request funding under the Vacancy Reduction Program or another HUD program (e.g.,
CIAP or the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program), or for which approval of demolition/disposition is required
but has not yet been granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To be eligible under this NOFA, a PHA must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Have had a vacancy rate that exceeded 15.9% on March 30, 1993, the date used in the HUD survey of vacancies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Have had a receiver appointed for the PHA pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; or

F. Eligibility of Activities and Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following activities are eligible for funding to the extent that they are essential to the goal of improving and
maintaining a lower vacancy rate at the PHA. The extent to which activities requested for funding are essential to
the achievement of this goal will be determined by HUD on the basis of the application and the vacancy assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Management improvements that have the following characteristics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The management improvements generally may not exceed 25% of the hard costs to be funded (exclusive of costs for
lead-based paint abatement and handicapped accessibility), except that higher amounts for management improvements
may be approved when such expenditures are deemed by HUD to be critical to the reduction of vacancies in the PHA. Management
improvements include, but are not limited to: activities permitted under paragraph 2&hyph;3 of CIAP Handbook 7485.1
(Rev. 4); equal opportunity and civil rights training; and the development of appropriate procedures when there
are management problems regarding the PHA's administration of equal opportunity requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The management improvement costs shall be funded one time only, to cover a period not to exceed three years or,
with regard to PHAs with serious management difficulties, such period as is proposed by the PHA and approved by HUD.
Where an approved Vacancy Reduction Program includes management improvements that involve ongoing costs, such
as security, HUD will not be obligated to provide any continued funding or additional operating subsidy after the
funded period. The PHA shall be responsible for finding other funding sources or reducing its ongoing management
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Rehabilitation or repair of vacant eligible units to bring the unit at least into compliance with the Housing Quality
Standards (HQS), as set forth in 24 CFR 882.109. Correction of HQS deficiencies outside the unit is not required, unless
the correction of the HQS deficiencies is essential to the marketability of the vacant units in the development. Any
physical component that is replaced must meet the standards for such components set forth in the Public Housing Modernization
Standards Handbook, 7485.2 Rev.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Costs necessary to provide accessibility in eligible units to persons with disabilities, in accordance with
the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Lead-based paint activity, as defined in Section I.D of this NOFA, in eligible units. For lead-based paint (LBP)
activities, the PHA is required to comply with 24 CFR part 965, subpart H, and 24 CFR part 35. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Development-wide improvements that are essential to the marketability of the eligible units, such as improvements
made to enhance security or ``curb appeal.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Reconfiguration of the interior of buildings or units when there is documentation of significant problems in
marketability for the currently available unit size. Documentation for reconfiguration must meet the requirements
of HUD Handbook 7465.1 REV. In addition, where reconfiguration is requested, applicants must document that the lack
of demand for these units is not compounded by the failure of the PHA to transfer inappropriately housed families.
Approval of an application under this NOFA that includes reconfiguration activity will constitute HUD approval
of the reconfiguration and no further HUD approval is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When vacancies are attributable to families being overhoused, activities relating to reassigning those families
and repairing of the occupied units made vacant by the reassignment may be included in the PHA request, if the reassignment
is essential to correcting the vacancy problem. However, such units will be considered only if the reassignment and
repair is likely to result in a decrease of the vacancy rate in the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Other related activities and improvements eligible under the modernization program (see 24 CFR part 968), such
as administrative expenses, fees and costs, nondwelling structures and equipment, and relocation, but only to the
extent that such costs are necessary to support activity otherwise eligible and are essential to the achievement
and maintenance of a lower vacancy rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Demolition of vacant units, when a demolition application has been approved by HUD and the demolition has not been
previously funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) If the PHA has fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, the PHA will be reimbursed
for the costs of rehabilitating the formerly vacant units only if funds remain available after the Department has
funded all other eligible costs at all PHAs applying for funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The total amount of funding for which a PHA is eligible is the sum of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For each development, the necessary costs of rehabilitation of eligible units; development-wide physical improvements,
including common areas; demolition; or reconfiguration. These costs are not to exceed $8,000 times the number of
eligible units in the development at the time of application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Necessary costs of management improvements, not to exceed 25% of the total hard costs to be funded for all developments
(exclusive of costs for lead-based paint abatement and handicapped accessibility), except that the Assistant Secretary
may approve higher amounts for management improvements when such expenditures are deemed critical to reduction
of vacancies in the PHA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Other related costs as discussed in paragraph (1)(h) (under ``Eligible Activities'') of this Section I.F; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Necessary costs for lead-based paint containment or abatement in eligible units; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Necessary costs for handicapped accessibility for eligible units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligible Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Activities are not eligible if the activities are under contract; have been selected for funding from other sources,
such as Urban Revitalization Demonstration (URD) grants, CIAP, or State or local funding; or if the PHA has sufficient
funds in its operating budget or pursuant to its formula grant under the CGP to fund the activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sufficiency of funds will be determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For hard costs, a CGP agency will be deemed to have insufficient funds for the activities if the Assessment of Physical
Needs in the Comprehensive Plan shows a need for funds greater than the funds expected to be available to the PHA under
the CGP in the next five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For management improvements, a CGP agency will be deemed to have insufficient funds if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For CGP agencies, the Management Needs Assessment in the Comprehensive Plan shows a need for funds greater than
10% of the funds expected to be available to the PHA under its CGP in the next five years; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The PHA plans to use at least 10% of its CGP funds for management improvements in each of the next five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, for CGP and Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) agencies, operating funds will
be deemed to be insufficient only if the PHA has an operating reserve of less than 75% of the maximum allowable reserve.

G. Resident Involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHA shall develop a process that assures that residents are fully briefed, have an opportunity to comment on the
proposed content of the PHA's application in response to this NOFA, and to be involved in all phases of the process.
Particular attention shall be given to opportunities for resident employment. The PHA shall give full consideration
to the comments and concerns of residents. The process shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Informing residents of the applicable housing developments about the preparation of the application, including
a discussion of the report of the assessment team and actions that will be taken to address any deficiencies;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Once a draft application has been prepared, the PHA shall make a copy available for reading in the management office;
provide copies of the draft to any resident organization representing the residents of any development involved;
and provide adequate opportunity for comment by the residents of the developments and their representative organizations
prior to making the application final;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Providing to HUD and any resident organization representing the development a summary of the resident comments
and the PHA's response to them; and notifying residents of the developments that the summary and responses are available
for reading in the management office; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) After HUD approval of a grant, notifying residents of the development and any representative organizations of
the approval of the grant; providing any resident organization with a copy of the HUD-approved implementation schedule;
notifying the residents that the schedule is available in the management office for reading; and developing a system
to facilitate regular resident monitoring of the program.

H. Resident Training, Employment, and Contracting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vacancy Reduction Program provides an ideal opportunity to enhance resident training, employment, and contracting.
In furtherance of HUD goals and priorities, PHAs should, to the greatest extent possible, provide such opportunities
for residents under this program, including development of programs under section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3). Section 3 requires best efforts on the part of the PHA to give low- and very
low-income persons training and employment opportunities generated by Vacancy Reduction Program assistance,
and to award contracts for work to be performed in connection with Vacancy Reduction Program assistance to business
concerns that provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons. A PHA shall include in its vacancy
reduction plan the projected number of residents the PHA expects to be trained or hired, and the number of business
firms that provide economic opportunity to low- and very low-income persons to be contracted with for vacancy reduction
activities, whether directly by the PHA or through business concerns with which the PHA has contracts for vacancy
reduction activities.

I. Required Results
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except as provided below, funds provided under this NOFA must be expended and units reoccupied within 24 months
from the date of funding, and management improvements must be implemented fully within 3 years from the date of funding.
However, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing may approve alternative schedules proposed by PHAs
with significant management improvement needs. Funds awarded under this program that are not obligated on a timely
basis may be recaptured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the funding period, move-ins to developments funded under this program must at least equal the number of
move-outs plus the number of units funded under this program (excluding units that are vacated for modernization
and later reoccupied after modernization). At the end of the funding period, the PHA's current vacancy rate must be
reduced to the extent of the number of units funded under this program.

J. Selection and Funding Process

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sufficiency of Application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to be considered for funding, an application must be complete and consistent with the terms of this NOFA, and
the vacancy reduction plan must generally be consistent with the recommendations of the assessment team. The Department
recognizes that some variance will exist since some of the assessments already conducted concentrated on units that
could be repaired for $10,000 or less. In determining the amount of funds to be reserved for each approvable application,
HUD will review the request for consistency with the recommendations of the assessment team and will consider any
other information HUD may have available. When an approvable vacancy reduction plan submitted in response to this
NOFA needs improvement or supplementation, HUD will require any necessary changes or additions to the plan, and will
assist the PHA in revising its plan, before execution of the amendment of the ACC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management Deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a PHA does not adequately address management weaknesses that contribute to its vacancy problem and have been reported
by the assessment team, its application will be deemed ineligible for funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funding Decisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a PHA is requesting funding for eligible units in which rehabilitation costs will exceed an average of $8,000
(see paragraph (1)(a)(ii) in the definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D of this NOFA), HUD will determine
whether the PHA's plan to fund the cost above an average of $8,000 per unit is reasonable. However, no PHA may receive
greater than 15 percent of the total amount of funding available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CIAP Agencies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will fully fund all eligible units and associated costs (as defined in Section I.F of this NOFA) for which CIAP agencies
apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CGP Agencies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From the remaining funds HUD will fund eligible applications from CGP agencies to the extent funding is available.
Of the total funds remaining available for CGP agencies, 75 percent will be made available for units eligible under
paragraph (1)(a)(i) in the definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D, ``Definitions,'' of this NOFA. The other
25 percent will be made available for units eligible under paragraph (1)(a)(ii) of that definition of ``eligible
unit''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the amount of funds available is sufficient to fund fully (including the costs of management improvements,
lead-based paint control, and accessibility for the disabled) all CGP agencies in either category of funding, HUD
will fund those requests fully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the total funding requested by CGP agencies in any category exceeds the total amount of funds available in that
category, the amount to be reserved for each CGP agency will be determined as follows, except that an agency will not
be funded at a level exceeding its budget request:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the amount of available funding is sufficient, each CGP agency will be funded for its eligible costs (exclusive
of management improvements and the costs of lead-based paint control and accessibility for the disabled). If funds
remain available after funding the requested costs under this paragraph, each CGP agency will receive a pro rated
share of the remaining funds, according to the ratio of eligible related costs (i.e., management improvements and
the costs of lead-based paint control and accessibility for the disabled) requested by the agency to the total of eligible
related costs requested by all CGP agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the amount of available funding is not sufficient to fund all eligible costs costs under paragraph (3)(b)(ii)(A)
of this Section I.J, the funding allocated to each CGP agency will be its pro rata share of funds, determined by using
the same ratio as the number of eligible units in the CGP agency in that category for which funding is requested to the
total number of eligible units in that category for which funding is requested by all applicant CGP agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) If funds remain available in either category and there are unmet needs in the other category, the excess funds
will be reallocated to the category in which additional funding is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If applications from CGP agencies are not fully funded, those agencies will be required to revise their vacancy
reduction plans and budgets to indicate which items will be funded with the amounts reserved for the CGP agency under
this program and state alternative plans for unfunded vacancies. To the extent that funds are prorated for its units
averaging more than $8,000 in costs, each CGP agency receiving program funds under paragraph (1)(a)(ii) of that definition
of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D, ``Definitions,'' will be required to commit a portion of the funds the agency
had agreed to commit from independent resources if those units had been funded in the full amount requested. This portion
will be determined by applying (to the total commitment made in the application) the ratio of funding received for
those units to funding requested for those units.

Remaining funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If funds remain available after funding all eligible activities under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section I.J(3), ``Funding
Decisions,'' of this NOFA, a PHA may be reimbursed for costs, or a portion of costs, associated with rehabilitating
certain occupied units. The PHA must have fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1,
1993, and must have expended funds on those units in reasonable anticipation of reimbursement from Vacancy Reduction
Program funds.

K. Implementation of Plan and Other Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An applicant's vacancy reduction plan must be approved before an application is funded under this NOFA even though,
in most cases, the plan will cover the physical treatment of many units that are not eligible under this NOFA. The PHA
is expected to implement the plan using available funds, including the operating budget and CGP funds, and by requesting
funds under discretionary programs, including CIAP and the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program. HUD will
monitor implementation of the vacancy reduction plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Eligible units that a PHA originally planned to fund with CGP funds may also be funded under this NOFA, as long as
they are not currently under contract. The PHA may then reprogram its CGP funds to other work set forth in the Five-Year
Action Plan.

The intent of the Department is to assist each high vacancy PHA to develop a plan that will assure success in reducing
the PHA's vacancy rate and improving management capacity to assure continued progress in reaching high occupancy
levels. If a plan submitted in response to this NOFA is approved under the NOFA, but needs improvement or supplementation,
HUD will so advise the PHA. The Department will specify areas in which improvement or supplementation is needed and
require that revisions be made prior to execution of the amendment of the ACC. HUD staff will be available to assist
the PHA in revising its plan.

A. Environmental Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The finding
of no significant impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.

B. Federalism Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. The NOFA merely
sets forth funding availability for eligible PHAs that require the assistance to undertake vacancy reduction activities.

C. Family Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
notice has potential for a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. The purpose
of the notice is to provide funding to improve housing opportunities by reducing the number of vacant units in the inventories
of PHAs, which could benefit some families significantly. However, because the impact on families would be indirect
and would be beneficial, no further review is considered necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) was published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified
as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD) (this is not
a toll-free number). The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However,
a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with
persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Field Office Counsel or Headquarters counsel for the program
to which the question pertains.

F. Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b), added by section 112 of the Reform
Act, contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance.
The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others
to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of that part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about part 86 should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For each project identified, set out a schedule for completing the actions identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)
of this section and removing the dwelling units from the PHA's inventory of vacant units. If the timing of any action
is dependent upon a HUD approval or decisionmaking process, the schedule for the PHA action may be presented in terms
of a specified time period following completion of the HUD process. For each action, the schedule shall include the
number of vacancies that will be eliminated by the end of each 12-month period after the PHA begins to receive assistance
under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For units vacated during the last two years, when the PHA has been unable to return these units to occupancy within

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Identifying any vacant dwelling units that are eligible for modernization, major reconstruction, demolition,
or disposition, but have not been funded or approved for these activities and are not likely to be funded or approved
for at least three years. The statement shall include an estimate of the amount of assistance necessary to complete
the modernization, major reconstruction, demolition, or disposition of these units; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Identifying any vacant units not identified under paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section. The statement
shall include a description of any appropriate activities relating to elimination of the vacancies in these units
and an estimate of the amount of assistance necessary to carry out the activities identified under this paragraph;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Setting forth an agenda for implementation of management improvements during the first fiscal year beginning
after submission of the plan. If the timing of any improvement is dependent upon a HUD approval or decisionmaking process,
the schedule for the improvement may be presented in terms of a specified time period following completion of the HUD
process. The agenda should include any management improvements recommended by the assessment team pursuant to &sect;968.410
and an estimate of the amount of assistance necessary to implement the management improvements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Of any other information that the Secretary shall deem appropriate, as provided in the applicable NOFA. Such information
