SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class E airspace at Refugio, TX. Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground
level, has been designated at the Mellon Ranch Airport, Refugio, TX. This airspace overlies Rooke Field, located
approximately 6 nautical miles (NM) west of the Mellon Ranch Airport. Operators at Rooke Field have requested that
Rooke Field be excluded from the Class E airspace at Mellon Ranch Airport. Since the airspace within a 1/2 mile radius
of Rooke Field is not needed to conduct safe operations, this action is intended to exclude that airspace from the Mellon
Ranch Airport, Refugio, TX, Class E airspace.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 9, 1994, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace at Refugio, TX, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11010).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. One commenter expressed concern about excluding the airspace within a 2 NM radius of Rooke
Field from the Class E airspace at Mellon Ranch Airport. However, in a subsequent comment, the same commenter stated
that he had no objection to excluding the airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field from the Mellon Ranch Airport
Class E airspace. After further analysis, the FAA concurs with the final position of the commenter and is reducing
the amount of excluded airspace to that airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field. This change will allow the
continuation of more controlled airspace for the Mellon Ranch Airport while relinquishing unneeded control over
the operations at Rooke Field. Additionally, the NPRM incorrectly listed the airspace in the narrative description
as ``E2''. The designation of E2 is used to designate Class E airspace from the surface. The correct designation for
this Class E airspace is ``E5''. Except for these modifications, this amendment is adopted as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies the Class E airspace located at Refugio, TX.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class E airspace at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX. An amendment to the very high frequency omnidirectional
range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at Cleburne Municipal
Airport, Cleburne, TX, has necessitated this action. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground
level designated in conjunction with an airport for which an approved instrument approach procedure has been prescribed
is needed to control aircraft executing the SIAP's. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for
IFR operations at Cleburne, TX.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 1, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63309).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Except for latitude/longitude position updates for Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport; McKinney Municipal Airport; Mesquite, Phil Hudson Municipal Airport; Mesquite radio
beacon (RBN); Lancaster RBN; Fort Worth Spinks Airport; Weatherford, Parker Country Airport; Bridgeport Municipal
Airport; and Decatur Municipal Airport, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revises the Class E airspace located at Dallas/Fort
Worth, TX, to provide for adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Cleburne, TX.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission (``Commission'') is issuing a rule to exempt a system of records from certain
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a (``Privacy Act''), to the extent that the system contains investigatory
material pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws or compiled for law enforcement purposes. The system of records
includes the investigative files of the Office of Inspector General of the Commission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission proposed this rule on August 2, 1990, at 55 FR 31404. No comments have been received, and the rule is being
issued without change except for a fuller description of the record system subject to the rule and the correction of
typographical errors. The purpose and effect of the rule is set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Inspector General Act, 5 U.S.C. App., authorizes the Office of Inspector General of the Commission to conduct
investigations to detect fraud and abuse in the programs and operations of the Commission and to assist in the prosecution
of participants in such fraud or abuse. The Office of Inspector General of the Commission maintains information in
a system of records, identified as ``Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files_CPSC&hyph;6,'' pursuant
to its law enforcement and criminal investigation functions. Disclosure of information in these investigatory
files or disclosure of the identity of confidential sources could seriously undermine the effectiveness of the Inspector
General's investigations. For example, premature disclosure of information of such investigations could enable
suspects to take action to prevent detection of criminal activities, conceal or destroy evidence, or escape prosecution.
Premature disclosure of this information could also lead to the possible intimidation of, or harm to, informants,
witnesses, or investigative personnel and their families. Further, the imposition of certain Privacy Act restrictions
on the manner in which information is collected, verified, or retained could significantly impede the effectiveness
of the Inspector General's investigations and could preclude the apprehension and successful prosecution of persons
engaged in fraud or criminal activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Commission is issuing a rule to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act where
application of the Privacy Act would interfere with the conduct of an investigation by the Inspector General. Section
(k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), provides the authority for agencies to exempt records containing
investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purpose from certain other provisions of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information in this system of records may also be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications for federal civilian employment. Section (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), provides
that investigatory material compiled solely for those purposes may be exempted from certain other provisions of
the Privacy Act, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who
furnished information under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. The rule
being issued provides for such exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 CFR 1014.12 currently exempts other systems of records from certain requirements of the Privacy Act. This rule
adds a new paragraph to &sect;1014.12 to exempt the Inspector General's investigative files from certain requirements
of the Privacy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that the
amendment to 16 CFR 1014.12, Specific Exemptions, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17689), FDA published a final rule that amended the standard of identity for evaporated milk
(21 CFR 131.130) to: (1) Reduce the minimum milkfat content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight;
(2) reduce the minimum total milk solids content requirement from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight; and (3) add a minimum
milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent by weight. This action was based on a petition from the American
Dairy Products Institute, 130 North Franklin St., Chicago, IL 60606.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA gave interested persons until May 16, 1994, to file objections or requests for a hearing. The agency received no
objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA finds that the final rule published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 This document contains final income tax regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing rules for allocating net operating loss or taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income, and net capital loss or gain, within the taxable year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a loss corporation has an ownership change under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the loss corporation to elect to allocate these amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the period ending on the change date and the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning on the day after the change date as if its books were

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains final regulations to be added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code. The final regulations provide rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation of net operating loss or taxable income and net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital loss or gain within the taxable year in which a loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation has an ownership change. Proposed regulations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54535). The IRS received public comments on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. No public hearing was requested and none was held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having considered the comments submitted, the IRS and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Treasury decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following an ownership change, section 382 limits the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of post-change income that may be offset by a corporation's pre-change loss. Sections 382(b)(3)(A) and (d)(1) require
that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as provided in section 382(h)(5) (relating to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in gains and losses) and in regulations, taxable income or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net operating loss must be allocated ratably to each day in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change year for purposes of applying the section 382 limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 383, similar rules apply with respect to pre-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital losses and certain pre-change credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide rules for allocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net operating loss or taxable income, and net capital loss or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain, within the change year. The proposed regulations generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that a loss corporation may allocate such items between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pre-change period and the post-change period (1) by ratably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocating an equal portion to each day in the change year, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) if it so elects, based on a closing of its books as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change date. The final regulations adopt the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with few changes. The most significant comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes are described below.

A. Consistency Rules for Consolidated and Controlled Groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide consistency rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporations that are members of consolidated groups or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled groups. These consistency rules are based on proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations applying section 382 to consolidated and controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups. The consistency rules contained in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations have been revised in the final regulations because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed consolidated and controlled group regulations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been finalized yet. The final regulations provide that if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing-of-the-books election is made with respect to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership change occurring during a consolidated return year, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations with respect to that ownership change must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the election. Further consideration will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to consistency rules for consolidated groups in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of final regulations applying section 382 to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups.

B. Limitation Increase Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Notice 87&hyph;79, 1987&hyph;2 C.B. 387, the IRS announced its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intention to issue regulations that would allow taxpayers to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a closing-of-the-books election. The Notice stated that, prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the issuance of regulations, taxpayers would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the statutory ratable allocation method unless they obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a private letter ruling allowing them to use a different method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Notice 87&hyph;79, the IRS issued a number of private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter rulings that authorized allocations based on a closing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayers' books. Some of these rulings allowed taxpayers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in their section 382 limitation to the extent that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net pre-change income was offset by net post-change loss in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing taxable income or loss for the change year. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the increased limitation was to put the taxpayer in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position similar to the position it would have been in had its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year ended on the change date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of simplicity, the proposed regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include a rule providing for increases in the annual section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382 limitation in cases in which net post-change loss offsets net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-change income. Several commentators questioned the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include a limitation increase rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations retain the approach of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, in which change year income and losses may be netted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together without limitation. This approach may be either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favorable or unfavorable to taxpayers, depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. This approach is disadvantageous when it results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the netting of a post-change loss against pre-change income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, the approach is advantageous to taxpayers that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to net a pre-change loss against post-change income without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation. In these cases, if the taxpayers' year had ended on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change date, the loss so used would have been subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 382 limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of a limitation increase rule would add significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity to the regulations. If taxpayers were protected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disadvantages of netting a post-change loss against pre- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change income, consistency would require that taxpayers not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed the benefit of netting pre-change loss against post- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change income without limitation. In other words, detailed rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for applying the section 382 limitation within the change year to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit the use of a loss in the pre-change portion of the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against income in the post-change period would be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concomitants of a limitation increase rule. To avoid this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity, the final regulations allow change year losses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offset change year income without limitation and do not include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation increase rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Additional Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the interaction of the ratable allocation rules under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations and the built-in gain and loss rules under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 382(h), particularly with respect to extraordinary items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an asset sale not made in the ordinary course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business). A commentator recommended that the final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include both a rule for extraordinary items and the limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase rule (described in paragraph B above). After due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration, the IRS and the Treasury Department decided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules relating to extraordinary items would add unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity to the final regulations. Thus, the final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not contain special rules with respect to the allocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraordinary items. The IRS and the Treasury Department may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give further consideration to the desirability of rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing extraordinary items.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on small business.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of this section, a loss corporation must allocate its net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating loss or taxable income (see section 382(k)(4)), and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net capital loss (see section 1222(10)) or modified capital gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net income (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section), for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period by ratably allocating an equal portion to each day in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (d) of this section, a loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation may elect to allocate its net operating loss or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable income and its net capital loss or modified capital gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net income for the change year between the pre-change period and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the post-change period as if the loss corporation's books were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed on the change date. An election under this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) does not terminate the loss corporation's taxable year as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the change date (e.g., the change year is a single tax year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of section 172).

Time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A loss corporation makes the closing-of-the-books 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election by including the following statement on the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement required by &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(a)(2)(ii) for the change year: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``THE CLOSING-OF-THE-BOOKS ELECTION UNDER &sect;1.382&hyph;6(b) IS HEREBY 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRING ON [INSERT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DATE].'' The election must be made on or before the due date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including extensions) of the loss corporation's income tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return for the change year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Election irrevocable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An election under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) is irrevocable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consolidated groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an election under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) is made with respect to an ownership change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring in a consolidated return year, all allocations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section with respect to that ownership change must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the election. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlled groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section does not apply, and if, as part of the same plan or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement, two or more members of a controlled group (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 1563(a), determined by substituting ``50

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to section 1563(a)(4)), have ownership changes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be members of the controlled group (or become members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the same other controlled group), a closing-of-the-books 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election applies only if the election is made by all members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having the ownership changes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the change year_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Net operating loss or taxable income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is determined without regard to gains or losses on the sale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange of capital assets; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Net operating loss or taxable income and net capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss or modified capital gain net income are determined without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to the section 382 limitation and do not include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following items, which are allocated entirely to the post-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Any income, gain, loss, or deduction to which section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382(h)(5)(A) applies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Any income or gain recognized on the disposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets transferred to the loss corporation during the post-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for a principal purpose of ameliorating the section 382 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjustment to net operating loss_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining capital gain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of modified capital gain net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income (defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) allocated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each period is offset by capital losses to which section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382(h)(5)(A) applies and capital loss carryovers, subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 382 limitation (in the case of modified capital gain net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income allocated to the post-change period).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of net operating loss allocated to each period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reduced (but not below zero) without regard to the section 382 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation, first by the modified capital gain net income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining in the same period, and then by the modified capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain net income remaining in the other period.

Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76(b).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If &sect;1.1502&hyph;76 applies (relating to the taxable year of members of a consolidated group), an allocation
of items under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is determined after applying &sect;1.1502&hyph;76. Thus, if a
short taxable year under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76 is a change year for which an allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this section is to be made, the allocation under this section applies only to the items allocated to that short
taxable year under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allocation of certain credits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The principles of this section apply for purposes of allocating, under section 383, excess foreign taxes under section
904(c), current year business credits under section 38, and the minimum tax credit under section 53. The loss corporation
must use the same method of allocation (ratable allocation or closing-of-the-books) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of sections 382 and 383. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Examples.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Assume that the loss corporation, L, a calendar year taxpayer with a May 26, 1995, change date, determines a section
382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) of $100,000. Thus, for the change year, its section 382 limitation is $100,000
&times; (219/365)=$60,000. L makes the closing-of-the- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
books election under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Assume that L has a $150,000 capital loss carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) and a $300,000 net operating loss
carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) to the change year. L recognizes, in the pre-change period, $200,000 of ordinary
loss, and, in the post-change period, $150,000 of capital gain and $100,000 of ordinary income. Assume that section
382(h) does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the capital gain or the ordinary income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) L has a $100,000 net operating loss for the change year ($200,000 pre-change loss less $100,000 post-change
income), as determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because L has no current year capital losses, L's
$150,000 capital gain recognized in the post-change period is its modified capital gain net income for the change
year (as defined at paragraph (g)(4) of this section). L allocates $100,000 of net operating loss to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-change period and $150,000 of modified capital gain net income to the post-change period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryover to offset its modified capital gain
net income allocated to the post-change period, subject to its section 382 limitation. L's section 382 limitation
is $60,000, so L uses $60,000 of its capital loss carryover to offset $60,000 of its $150,000 modified capital gain
net income. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L offsets its $100,000 net operating loss allocated to the pre-change
period by the $90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period, without regard to the
section 382 limitation, thereby reducing its pre-change net operating loss to $10,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $90,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996
taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $10,000 of net operating loss subject to the section 382
limitation to its 1996 taxable year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Assume the facts of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L does not make the closing-of-the-books election under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) L ratably allocates its $100,000 net operating loss and its $150,000 of modified capital gain net income for the
change year. $40,000 of net operating loss ($100,000 &times; (146/365)) and $60,000 of modified capital gain net
income ($150,000 &times; (146/365)) are allocated to the pre-change period. $60,000 of net operating loss ($100,000
&times; (219/365)) and $90,000 of modified capital gain net income ($150,000 &times; (219/365)) are allocated to
the post-change period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryovers to offset modified capital gain
net income. The capital loss carryovers offset the $60,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the pre-change
period without limitation. Subject to the section 382 limitation, the remaining $90,000 of capital loss carryovers
offset the modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period. Accordingly, L uses $60,000 of its
capital loss carryovers to offset $60,000 of its $90,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change
period. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L's $60,000 net operating loss allocated to the post-change period
is offset by its remaining $30,000 of post-change modified capital gain net income, reducing its post-change net
operating loss to $30,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $30,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996
taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $70,000 of net operating loss ($40,000 pre-change +$30,000
post-change) to its 1996 taxable year. The $40,000 pre-change portion of that carryover is subject to the section
382 limitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On page 22324, column 3, remove the third full paragraph beginning ``Institutions may choose .&blank;.&blank;.'',
and insert in its place ``An institution substantiates its compliance with this standard by having either the auditor
who prepares its financial statement audit or the auditor who prepares its title IV, HEA program compliance audit
report on the accuracy of its compliance determination. The auditor's report must be based on performing an ``attestation
engagement'' in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA's) Statement on
Standards for Attestation Engagements. The auditor must submit his or her report with the appropriate audit report.
In the attestation report, the auditor must indicate whether the institution's determination that the percentage
of its revenues derived from title IV, HEA program funds is not more than 85 percent of its revenues is accurate; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated under the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act. The affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are codified at 40 CFR parts 30, 31 and 33. EPA will continue to present OMB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 48 CFR Part 1501 of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acquisition Regulations, in 40 CFR Part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the part and section numbers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display of the OMB control numbers and their subsequent codification in the Code of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICR(s) were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unnecessary.

Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 162.3(c), and include,
but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting and spreading
agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply to nontoxicity;
the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. The data submitted in the petitions and other
relevant material have been evaluated. This inert ingredient is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance
is sought. Toxicological, ecological, and environmental fate data were considered in evaluating this inert ingredient
for use in pesticides. The data considered in support of these exemptions from tolerance include:

Residue data is generally not required for inert ingredient exemptions from tolerance. In this case, worst-case
residue calculations were done based on the proposed uses. These calculations indicated that a broad exemption could
not be granted without additional residue information because of the potential for high dietary exposure. The petitioner
therefore requested that the exemption be modified to include only the use of these solvents in cotton defoliant formulations
containing thidiazuron and diuron as active ingrdients. This yielded worstcase residue estimates of 735 ppm in cotton
seed, concentrating to 4,630 ppm in cottonseed oil. Consumption of cottonseed oil in children, the subgroup with
the highest exposure, is .036355 gms/kg/day. This leads to an exposure of .18 mg/kg/day, with a margin of exposure
of 166 from the NOAEL in the 90 day dog study. Residue information from thidiazuron as a cotton defoliant indicates
that actual residues for these inerts are expected to be orders of magnitude below this worst-case estimate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, these ingredients are useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore,
EPA proposes that the exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof, or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17751), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc.,
Barley Mill Plaza, P.O. Box 80038, Wilmington, DE 19880-0038, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 1F3961 and
1F3962 to EPA proposing that 40 CFR part 180 be amended under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
21 U.S.C. 346a, by establishing tolerances for the herbicides thifensulfuron methyl (methyl-3-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-2-thiophene
carboxylate) and tribenuron methyl (methyl-2-[[[[

- (4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) methylamino] carbonyl] amino]sulfonyl] benzoate), each on the raw
agricultural commodities (RAC) oat grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm) and oat straw at 0.1 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A hospital must provide inpatient hospital services to individuals who have health coverage provided by either the
Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) or the Civilian Health and Medical Program
of the Veterans Administration (CHAMPVA), subject to limitations provided by regulations that require the hospital
to collect the beneficiary's cost-share and accept payment from the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs as payment in full.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hospital must provide inpatient hospital services to military veterans (subject to the limitations provided in
38 CFR 17.50 ff.) and accept payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs as payment in full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hospital must give each Medicare beneficiary (or his or her representative) at or about the time of admission, a written
statement of his or her rights concerning discharge from the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hospital (including a rural primary care hospital) with an emergency department must provide, upon request and
within the capabilities of the hospital or rural primary care hospital, an appropriate medical screening examination,
stabilizing treatment and/or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility to any individual with an emergency
medical condition, regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning participation in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs, hospital admissions for veterans, a requirement
for a discharge rights notice, and hospital responsibility for emergency care (53 FR 22513). Below is a discussion
of the issues for which we proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Participation in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services) and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Veterans Administration) programs pay for health care services furnished to dependents and survivors
of military personnel, to retirees and their dependents, and to veterans. Generally, the programs have paid hospitals
based on the hospital's charges. Section 931 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 98&hyph;94), authorized these programs to pay (to the extent practicable) for inpatient hospital services
using Medicare payment procedures. Because the Medicare prospective payment system (the system whereby we pay a
hospital a predetermined amount based on the patient's diagnosis and any surgical procedures performed, rather
than by the number of days hospitalized) results in Medicare cost savings, the Department of Defense (DoD) expected
to realize similar savings if it were to use a model similar to Medicare's prospective payment system. Paying on the
basis of a fixed rate appropriate to the particular diagnosis involved has been shown to be an equitable method of paying
for hospital care. Therefore, the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS)
published a final rule on September 1, 1987, that included provisions for the implementation of a DRG-based payment
system modeled after Medicare's prospective payment system for CHAMPUS inpatient hospital admissions occurring
on or after October 1, 1987 (52 FR 32992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals that furnish services to CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA beneficiaries are authorized to provide services to these
beneficiaries following an approval process similar to that used for Medicare participation. Generally, that means
the hospital is licensed and accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO),
and otherwise meets CHAMPUS requirements. A hospital certified and participating under Medicare may be deemed to
meet CHAMPUS requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Participation'' has a different meaning for CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA than for Medicare. Providers have been able to
decide on a claim-by-claim basis whether to ``participate'' in the program and thus accept the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA-determined
allowable amount, plus the patient cost-share, as payment in full. Beneficiaries are required to pay a cost-share
for each hospital admission. The CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA payment, plus the beneficiary's cost-share, constitute payment
in full for the covered services when the provider signs and submits an appropriately completed program claim form
that indicates participation. Under Medicare, hospitals must agree to bill the program for all beneficiaries and
accept the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA payment as payment in full (less applicable deductibles, coinsurance amounts, and noncovered
items). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, Medicare hospitals also may be authorized providers in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA on the basis of their
JCAHO-approved status or may be deemed authorized providers based on their Medicare-approved status. The benefits
to the DoD of requiring the providers to be paid either under a DRG-based payment system or based on reasonable cost
are lost, however, if the hospitals can selectively participate in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 9122 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Pub. L. 99&hyph;272, all
Medicare hospitals are now required, beginning January 1987, to participate in CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA as authorized
providers (that is, they must bill CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA and accept the CHAMPVA/CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount
as payment in full, less applicable deductible, patient cost-share, and noncovered items). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Participation in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Broadly speaking, a veteran can only receive services from a non-VA hospital for a service-connected disability
when there is a medical emergency or when a VA facility is not available. In such cases, the VA in the past paid for the
services based on usual and customary charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As this type of payment is more expensive than payment made on a prospective basis or based on reasonable costs, the
VA has implemented a national prospective payment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To alleviate hospital expenses for the VA, Congress passed section 233 of the Veterans' Benefit Improvement and Health-Care
Authorization Act of 1986 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 99&hyph;576). This section requires Medicare hospitals to be participating providers of medical care to
veterans eligible to receive care at the hospital. The hospital then receives payment for the services under the applicable
VA payment system, in accord with the recent regulations concerning the payment methodology and amounts that the
VA provides for those hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital care to veterans whose care has been authorized or
will be sponsored by the VA (55 FR 42848). This rule was developed jointly by VA and HHS, and the VA payment system conforms
to Medicare's hospital inpatient prospective payment system in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the prospective payment system became effective for the Medicare program, we began to hear allegations that
Medicare beneficiaries were discharged too early from the hospital. We also began to receive complaints that patients
did not understand their rights as Medicare beneficiaries in cases in which they were advised that discharge was appropriate
but they disagreed. On April 17, 1985, we revised 42 CFR 466.78(b)(3) to require all hospitals to provide Medicare
beneficiaries with information about Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) review, including
beneficiary appeal rights (50 FR 15331). In further response to concerns about early discharges and lack of adequate
appeal information, we began requiring all hospitals to furnish each Medicare beneficiary upon admission a specific
statement developed by HCFA (that is, ``An Important Message from Medicare'' (see Appendix I)) telling a beneficiary
of his or her rights to be fully informed about decisions affecting Medicare coverage or payment and about his or her
appeal rights in response to any hospital's notice to the effect that Medicare will no longer cover the care. The ``Message''
we developed also advises the patient of what to do when he or she receives such a hospital statement and how to elicit
more information. The requirements relating to ``An Important Message from Medicare'' were incorporated into the
program's operating instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress subsequently passed section 9305(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 86). Now, as
part of its participation agreement with Medicare, each hospital (including those not paid under the prospective
payment system) must agree to furnish each Medicare beneficiary with a notice, at or about the time of admission, that
explains the patient's rights in detail.

D. Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency Cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hospitals that choose to participate in the Medicare program agree in writing to meet various requirements included
in section 1866 of the Social Security Act (the Act). Before enactment of COBRA on April 7, 1986, the Act did not specifically
address the issue of how hospitals with emergency medical departments must handle individuals who have emergency
medical conditions or who are in labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its Report accompanying H.R. 3128, the House Ways and Means Committee indicated that Congress was concerned about
the increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms were refusing to accept or treat individuals with
emergency conditions if the patients did not have medical insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Report stated that there were reports that individuals in an unstable condition were transferred
improperly, sometimes without the consent of the receiving hospital. Because Congress believed that this situation
may have worsened since the Medicare prospective payment system for hospitals became effective, the Report stated
that the Committee ``wants to provide a strong assurance that pressures for greater hospital efficiency are not to
be construed as license to ignore traditional community responsibilities and loosen historic standards.'' (H.R.
Rep. No. 99&hyph;241, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 27 (1985).) Subsequently, section 9121 of COBRA, sections 6003(g)(3)(D)(XIV),
6018, and 6211 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 89), Pub. L. 101&hyph;239, and sections 4008(b),
4027(a), and 4027(k)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90), Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, have all
addressed this concern.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9122 of COBRA amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (J), which requires hospitals
in the Medicare program to be participating providers of medical care, for inpatient services only, under any health
plan contracted for under 10 U.S.C. 1079 or 1086 (CHAMPUS) or under 38 U.S.C. 613 (CHAMPVA), in accordance with admission
practices and payment methodology and amounts as prescribed under joint regulations issued by the Secretaries of
Health and Human Services, Defense, and Transportation. This requirement applies to services furnished to CHAMPUS
and CHAMPVA beneficiaries admitted on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Section 9122 of COBRA also required that the legislation apply to all agreements entered into on or after April 7,
1986, but this requirement was deleted by section 1895(b)(6) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;514), enacted
October 22, 1986.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 233 of the Veterans' Benefit Improvement and Health-Care Authorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;576)
was enacted on October 28, 1986. It added a new paragraph (L) to section 1866 (a)(1) of the Act. It requires hospitals
that participate in Medicare to be participating providers under 38 U.S.C. 603, in accordance with the admissions
practices, and payment methodology and amounts, prescribed under joint regulations issued to implement this section
by the Secretary of HHS and the Administrator of the VA. This provision applies to services furnished to veterans admitted
on or after July 1, 1987.

C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9305(b)(1) of OBRA 86, which was enacted on October 21, 1986, added a new paragraph (M) to section 1866(a)(1)
of the Act. That paragraph requires a hospital that is eligible to participate in the Medicare program to agree to furnish
a beneficiary, or an individual acting on his or her behalf, at or about the time of admission, with a written statement
of the beneficiary's discharge rights. The statement must explain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The individual's rights to benefits for inpatient hospital services and for posthospital services under Medicare;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The circumstances under which the individual will and will not be liable for charges for continued stay in the hospital;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The individual's right to appeal denials of benefits for continued inpatient hospital services, including the
practical steps to initiate the appeal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The individual's liability for services if the denial of benefits is upheld on appeal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Additional information that the Secretary specifies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9305(b)(2) of OBRA 86 requires that we prescribe the language to be used in the statement not later than 6 months
after the effective date of OBRA 86. After development of the revised language for the statement required under OBRA
86, the hospitals must comply with the requirement to give the revised statement to beneficiaries upon admission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below is a summary of the current legislative provisions concerning the responsibilities of Medicare participating
hospitals (including rural primary care hospitals) in emergency cases. This legislative summary first sets forth
the major provisions of section 1867 of the Act, as originally enacted by COBRA on April 7, 1986, and including all amendments
that have occurred since that time. The summary then describes separately the amendments made by OBRA 89 and OBRA 90,
which were enacted after the publication of the June 16, 1988, notice of proposed rulemaking.

1. Current Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9121 of COBRA added a paragraph (I) to section 1866(a)(1) of the Act and added a new section 1867 to the Act. As
amended, these sections prohibit hospitals (including rural primary care hospitals) with emergency medical departments
from refusing to treat individuals with unstable emergency medical conditions and also contain provisions designed
to halt the inappropriate transfers of these individuals to other medical facilities.

Section 1866(a)(1)(I) of the Act requires that a hospital participating in the Medicare program must agree to comply
with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act to the extent applicable. Section 1867 of the Act currently provides
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A hospital with an emergency department must, within the capabilities of its emergency department (including
ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department), provide an appropriate medical screening
examination to any individual who comes to the emergency department for examination or treatment of a medical condition
and on whose behalf the examination or treatment is requested; the purpose of the examination is to determine whether
the individual has an emergency medical condition. This requirement applies regardless of the individual's eligibility
for Medicare benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If an individual, regardless of eligibility for Medicare benefits, has an emergency medical condition, the
hospital must either provide for further examination and treatment (within its capabilities) to stabilize the medical
condition or make an appropriate transfer, with a proper certification, of the individual to another medical facility,
unless the treatment or transfer is refused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A hospital may not transfer an individual unless_

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
&blank;_A physician, or other qualified medical personnel, after consulting with a physician (who later countersigns
the certification because a physician is not physically present in the emergency department), has certified that
the medical benefits expected from the treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual
and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child, from effecting the transfer; and

the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In which the receiving facility has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual
and has agreed to accept the transfer and to provide appropriate medical treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In which the transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all appropriate medical records (or copies)
available at the time of transfer that are related to the emergency condition for which the individual has presented
including records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observation of signs or symptoms, preliminary
diagnosis, treatment provided, results of any tests and informal written consent or certification (or copies),
and the name and address of any on-call physician who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide
necessary stabilizing treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In which the transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including
the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_That meets other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the patient.

&bull;A hospital that fails to meet the requirements of section 1867 of the Act_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Is subject to termination of its Medicare provider agreement if it fails to comply with section 1867; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Is subject to civil monetary penalties if it negligently violates section 1867 of the Act. The penalty cannot
exceed $25,000 for each violation committed between August 1, 1986 (the effective date of the statute) and December
21, 1987, or $50,000 for violations on or after December 22, 1987. (The amount was raised by section 4009(a)(1) of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87), Pub. L. 100&hyph;203, effective December 22, 1987.)

&bull;Each physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual (including
a physician who is on-call for the care of such individual) is also subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $25,000
for each violation ($50,000 for violations on or after December 22, 1987), including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The signing of transfer certifications if the physician knew or should have known that the benefits of transfer
did not outweigh the risks, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Misrepresenting an individual's condition or other information, including a hospital's obligations
under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physician may also be excluded from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs for a violation
that is gross and flagrant or repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a hospital violates the requirements of section 1867 of the Act and a patient suffers personal harm as a direct
result, he or she may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, obtain damages for personal injury under
the law of the State in which the hospital is located and may obtain such equitable relief as is appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Any medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a participating hospital's violation
of section 1867 of the Act may obtain damages available in a civil action against the participating hospital, under
the law of the State in which the hospital is located, and may obtain such equitable relief as is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No civil action to obtain damages, as described above, may be brought more than 2 years after the date of the violation
with respect to which the action is brought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The following terms are defined for purposes of section 1867 of the Act: ``emergency medical condition,''
``hospital,'' ``participating hospital,'' ``to stabilize,'' ``stabilized,'' and ``transfer.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The provisions of section 1867 of the Act do not preempt any State or local law except where they directly conflict.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participating hospitals are not to delay a medical screening examination or treatment to ask about an individual's
status or method of payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participating hospitals with specialized capabilities or facilities are obligated to accept the appropriate
transfer of an individual requiring such services if the hospital has the capacity to treat them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals, or when there was no screening examination,
the appropriate PRO will assess whether the individual had an emergency condition that had not been stabilized before
the Office of Inspector General (OIG) imposes a civil monetary penalty or exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hospitals are required, among other things, to maintain medical and other records related to individuals
transferred to and from a hospital for a period of 5 years from the transfer date. Each hospital must maintain a list
of on-call physicians available to provide stabilizing treatment. Each hospital must also post a conspicuously
placed sign in its emergency department that lists the individuals' rights regarding their examination and treatment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hospitals are not to penalize or take an adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person who
refused to authorize the transfer of an unstabilized individual with an emergency medical condition or against a
hospital employee because the employee reported a violation.

a. OBRA 89 Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Rural primary care hospitals. A new category of provider, rural primary care hospitals, was established (section
6003(g)(3) of OBRA 89). Only facilities currently certified as hospitals and not in violation of any conditions of
participation (42 CFR part 482) could be designated by the Secretary as rural primary care hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance requirements (section 6018 of OBRA 89). Hospitals are required to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Adopt and enforce a policy to ensure compliance with section 1867 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Maintain medical and other records related to individuals transferred to or from a hospital for a period
of 5 years from the transfer date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Maintain a list of on-call physicians available for duty to provide treatment needed to stabilize an individual
with an emergency medical condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Posted information (section 6018 of OBRA 89). Participating hospitals must post conspicuously in their emergency
departments_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 +&blank;A sign listing the rights of individuals under section 1867 of the Act regarding examination and treatment
for emergency medical conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Information indicating whether the facility participates in the Medicaid program under a State plan approved
under title XIX of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both posted items are to be in a form specified by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Additional requirements for Medicare participating hospitals with emergency departments (section 6211
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 89). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The medical screening requirement was changed to indicate that the capability of the facility's emergency
department includes ``ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Participating facilities are now required to inform each individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf)
of the risks and benefits to the individual of examination and treatment and/or transfer, and to ``take all reasonable
steps to secure the individual's (or person's) written informed consent to refuse such examination and treatment''
and/or transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Changes were made relating to the restrictions on transfers to include_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_A requirement that participating facilities obtain written requests for transfer to another medical facility
after informing individuals (or legally responsible persons acting on their behalf) of the hospital's obligations
and the risk of transfer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_An explicit statement that there should be consideration of the risks and benefits to unborn children of women in
labor in determining whether the physician should certify that the benefits outweigh the risks of transfer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that transfer certifications by participating facilities include a summary of the risks and benefits
upon which the certification is based; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that when a qualified medical person signs the certification, it be done in consultation with a physician
and that the physician later countersign the certification; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that the hospital provide medical treatment within its capacity to minimize the risks of transfer;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that the transferring hospital include specified documents in the medical records sent to receiving
hospitals.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Civil monetary penalties (section 6211(e) of OBRA 89). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Physicians, including on-call physicians, are subject to civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
Medicare and the State health care programs for violations of section 1867 of the Act, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The signing of transfer certifications if the physician knew or should have known that the benefits of transfer did
not outweigh the risks; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Misrepresenting an individual's condition or other information on the transfer certification.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
+&blank;A participating facility or an on-call physician is subject to a penalty if the on-call physician fails or
refuses to appear within a reasonable period of time when notified by an emergency department physician that his or
her services are needed and the emergency physician orders a transfer because he or she determines that without the
services of the on-call physician the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks of transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specialty hospitals (section 6211(f) of OBRA 89). Participating hospitals with special capabilities or
facilities are obligated to accept the appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities
or facilities if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No delay in examination or treatment (section 6211(f) of OBRA 89). Participating hospitals are not to delay
the provision of a medical screening examination, treatment, or both, to inquire about the individual's method of
payment or insurance status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Whistleblower protections (section 6211(f) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 89). Participating hospitals may not take action against a physician because he or she refused to authorize the
transfer of an unstabilized individual with an emergency medical condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The term ``responsible physician'' is no longer used in section 1867(d) of the statute. It was changed to
``a physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual'' under section 1867(d)(1)(B)
of the Act. (Section 6211(e)(1) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The term ``patient'' was replaced with the term ``individual.'' (Section 6211(g) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The term ``emergency medical condition'' now includes a pregnant woman who is having contractions, either
when there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer, or when the transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety
of a pregnant woman or her unborn child. The term ``active labor'' was deleted. (Section 6211(h) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The terms ``to stabilize'' and ``stabilized'' now take into account what might occur during a transfer and
explicitly extend the protection of section 1867 of the Act to a pregnant woman until delivery (including the delivery
of the placenta). (Section 6211(h) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the provisions described above were effective beginning July 1, 1990, with the exception of the definition
of the term ``rural primary care hospital'', which was effective upon enactment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
b. OBRA 90 Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Civil monetary penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The standard for liability for imposing civil monetary penalties against hospitals and physicians was
changed from ``knowingly'' to ``negligently.'' (Sections 4008(b)(1) and 4027(a)(2) of OBRA 90.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Hospitals with fewer than 100 State-licensed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare-certified beds are subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $25,000, while all other hospitals
remain subject to a maximum CMP of $50,000. (Section 4008(b)(2) of OBRA 90.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Termination of hospital provider agreements (section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The provision in section 1867(d)(1) of the Act that subjected violating hospitals to termination or suspension
of their Medicare provider agreements was deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Hospitals are now required, under section 1866(a)(1)(I)(i), to adopt and enforce a policy to ensure compliance
with the requirements of section 1867 in order to participate in and receive payments under the Medicare program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PRO assessment (section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;In considering allegations of violations, before the OIG imposes a sanction, HCFA is required to request
the appropriate PRO (with a contract under part B of title XI) to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency
medical condition that had not been stabilized, except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The PRO must provide_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_An assessment of the alleged violation to determine whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition
that had not been stabilized and a report of the violation to the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Reasonable notice of the review to the physician and hospital involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Within the time allotted by the Secretary, reasonable opportunity for the affected physician and the hospital to
discuss the case with the PRO and to submit additional information before the PRO issues its report. The Secretary
will request such a review, except when delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was
no screening examination, before effectuating a sanction. When a delay would not jeopardize the health or safety
of individuals, the PRO will have at least 60 calendar days to complete its review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Standard for excluding physicians (section 4027(a)(3) of OBRA 90). The standard for excluding physicians,
including on-call physicians, from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs was changed from
``knowing and willful or negligent'' to ``gross and flagrant or is repeated.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised whistleblower protections (section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90). The prohibition of a hospital from penalizing
or taking adverse action against a physician because he or she refused to authorize the transfer of an unstabilized
individual with an emergency medical condition was extended to protect a qualified medical person. Also, a hospital
is prohibited from taking action against a hospital employee because the employee reported a violation of these requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drafting errors. We note that the drafters of OBRA 90 misnumbered the section following section 4206, calling
it section 4027. The drafters also misnumbered the subsections of section 4027, so that what should have been section
4027(k) was misnumbered as section 4027(m). The error in misnumbering the subsections was corrected between the
submission of the conference report and the enrolled bill, Pub. L. 101&hyph;508. The error in misnumbering the section
was not corrected, however. Therefore, the correct section numbers at present for the relevant sections of OBRA 90
are 4008(b), 4027(a) and 4027(k)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above provisions were effective May 1, 1991, with the exception of the provisions of section 4027(a)(1), which
were effective February 1, 1991, and the provisions of section 4027(k)(3), which were effective upon enactment.

We proposed to revise &sect;489.20, Basic commitments, to show that a participating Medicare hospital must agree
to participate in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs and accept payment from the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA program as payment
in full in accordance with a new &sect;489.25, which incorporates statutory provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In new &sect;489.25, we would require Medicare participating hospitals to be participating providers in the CHAMPUS
and CHAMPVA programs. We proposed to require the hospitals to comply with DoD regulations governing admissions practices
and payment methodology and amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such services. As noted above, CHAMPUS published a final rule on September 1, 1987, that contains provisions for
the implementation of a DRG-based payment system. We would continue the policy that hospitals participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA that also participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Medicare must meet all Medicare conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. Thus, if CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA have requirements for participating that differ from Medicare's, Medicare's
requirements also would have to be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to require hospitals to accept payment from CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs as payment in full for the services
provided to these beneficiaries (less applicable deductible, patient cost-share, and noncovered items). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we intended to add a new paragraph (11) to &sect;489.53, Terminations by HHS, to show that a hospital that
does not meet the requirements of &sect;489.25 would be subject to possible termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would apply only to inpatient hospital services furnished to beneficiaries admitted on or after
January 1, 1987.

B. Participation in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement section 233 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;576, we proposed to add a new &sect;489.26. Hospitals do not enter into
participation agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs program as they do if they choose to participate
in the Medicare program or the CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA programs. Instead, the VA authorizes payment for the treatment,
usually on a preadmission basis at a designated hospital that furnishes the service. We proposed to require a Medicare
participating hospital to admit any veteran whose hospitalization is authorized by the VA under 38 U.S.C. 603 (this
includes emergency cases, which may be authorized after admission). The hospital would have to meet the requirements
of 38 CFR Part 17 regarding admission practices and payment methodology and amounts published October 24, 1990 (55
FR 42848). This arrangement would not affect the hospital's need to meet all Medicare hospital conditions of participation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also proposed to revise &sect;489.20, Basic commitments, to require hospitals to admit veterans whose admission
is authorized under 38 U.S.C. 603 and to meet the requirements of &sect;489.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to revise &sect;489.53, Termination by HCFA, to show that HHS may terminate any hospital that fails
to meet the requirements of &sect;489.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would apply to inpatient services furnished to veterans admitted on or after July 1, 1987.

C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed to add a new &sect;489.27, to require participating hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital services
to Medicare beneficiaries to give every beneficiary (or individual acting on his or her behalf) at or about the time
of admission the publication ``An Important Message from Medicare.'' We did not specify the contents of the ``Message''
in the proposed rule, as hospitals are not responsible for writing it. We have distributed and will continue to distribute
to hospitals the language of the ``Message'' that they are to use. A copy of the ``Message'' is included as Appendix
I to this interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to require hospitals to obtain a separate signed acknowledgment from the beneficiary attesting to the
receipt of ``An Important Message from Medicare'' and to retain a copy of the acknowledgment. Effective with admissions
on and after March 24, 1986, PROs were required to monitor each hospital to assure that the hospital distributes ``An
Important Message from Medicare'' to all Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, we proposed to require the hospital
to obtain the beneficiary's separate, signed acknowledgment attesting to the receipt of the ``Message'' and to retain
a copy of the acknowledgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to revise &sect;489.20, Basic commitments, to show that a hospital must distribute ``An Important
Message from Medicare''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We planned to add a new paragraph (12) to &sect;489.53, Terminations by HHS, to show that a hospital failing to meet
the requirements of &sect;489.27 may be terminated. Whether or not HHS would terminate a provider would depend on
HCFA's judgment as to the scope of the failure and the hospital's correction or plan for correction of the failure.
We did not anticipate any hospital opposition to the requirement that the ``Message'' be distributed. We believe
we already have full cooperation from hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions were to apply only to Medicare admissions beginning after we distributed ``An Important Message from
Medicare''.

D. Hospital Emergency Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to the regulations we proposed on June 16, 1988 would have been revisions and additions to 42 CFR Part
489, Provider Agreements under Medicare, and revisions to 42 CFR Part 1001, Program Integrity_Medicare, and Part
1003, Civil Money Penalties and Assessments. Basically, the proposed provisions paralleled the statutory requirements
that were then in effect. We note that, as discussed above in section II.D. of this preamble, OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 included
amendments to section 1867 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Requirements for Hospitals With Emergency Care Departments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;We proposed to revise &sect;489.20, which discusses basic commitments, by adding a new paragraph to require
hospitals with emergency departments, as part of their participation agreement, to agree to comply with the new &sect;489.24,
which incorporates the statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We proposed to add a new section &sect;489.24, Special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency
cases, to set forth requirements for emergency cases for all hospitals that have provider agreements with Medicare.
We planned to require a hospital to take the following measures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Medical screening requirement_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any individual, regardless of his or her eligibility for Medicare, for whom emergency treatment or examination
is requested, we proposed to require a hospital with an emergency department to provide for an appropriate medical
screening examination within the emergency department's capability to determine whether an emergency medical
condition exists or whether the individual is in active labor, as defined below. The examinations would be conducted
by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws and who meet the requirements of &sect;482.55, which are
that emergency services be supervised by a qualified member of the medical staff and that there be adequate medical
and nursing personnel qualified in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated
by the facility. We proposed to allow hospitals maximum flexibility in their utilization of emergency care personnel
by not including specific requirements concerning education or credentials for individuals conducting emergency
medical examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Necessary stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions and active labor_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the individual has an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, we proposed that the hospital be required
to provide either further medical examination and treatment to stabilize the medical condition or treatment of the
labor or transfer the individual appropriately to another medical facility. We would not hold the hospital responsible
if the individual, or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, refuses to consent in writing
to the further examination and treatment or the appropriate transfer to another hospital.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under these provisions, the hospital would be responsible for treating and stabilizing any individual, regardless
of eligibility for Medicare, who presents himself or herself with an emergency condition at the hospital, and for
providing such care until the condition ceases to be an emergency or until the individual is properly transferred
to another facility. We interpreted this to mean, for example, that if a hospital were to admit and then transfer an
individual before his or her condition is stabilized, except as provided below, it would be a violation of section
1867 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Transfers and restrictions_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized or the individual is
in active labor, the hospital could not appropriately transfer the individual unless one of the following conditions
exist: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A physician (or other qualified medical personnel if a physician is not readily available in the emergency department)
has certified in writing that, based upon the reasonable risks and benefits to the individual and the information
available at the time, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment
at the other facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual's medical condition from the transfer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We considered a transfer to be appropriate only if the receiving medical facility has available space and qualified
personnel for the treatment of the individual and has agreed to accept the transfer of the individual and to provide
appropriate medical treatment. The transferring hospital would have to furnish the receiving medical facility
with timely appropriate medical records (for example, copies of the available history, examination, and treatment
records as well as any available reports of diagnostic studies performed). The patient would have to be accompanied
by qualified personnel during the transfer; transportation arrangements would have to include the use of necessary
and medically appropriate life support measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the statute authorized the Secretary to find that the transfer must meet ``other requirements'' in the interest
of the health and safety of individuals transferred, we did not propose to adopt any. We did, however, specifically
invite public comment concerning any ``other requirements'' the Secretary should consider adopting regarding
the health and safety of emergency department patients being transferred between medical facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to include in &sect;489.24 the following definitions as included in the statute, without interpretation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;``Active labor'' means labor at a time when delivery is imminent, there is inadequate time to effect safe
transfer to another hospital before delivery, or a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the patient
or the unborn child. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;An ``emergency medical condition'' means a medical condition manifested by acute symptoms of sufficient
severity (including severe pain) that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to
result in: (a) Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy; (b) serious impairment to bodily functions; or (c)
serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;``To stabilize'' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition, to provide the medical treatment
of the condition necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of
the condition is likely to result from the transfer of the individual from a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;``Stabilized'' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition, that no material deterioration
of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from the transfer of an individual from
a facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
+&blank;``Transfer'' means the movement (including the discharge) of a patient to outside a hospital's facilities
at the direction of any person employed by (or affiliated or associated with, directly or indirectly) the hospital,
but it does not include moving a patient who has been declared dead or who leaves the facility without the permission
of any person responsible for directing transfers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of these definitions, the term ``hospital'' means a Medicare facility certified as a hospital with
its own provider number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not plan to define ``participating provider'' in part 489; 42 CFR 400.202 defines terms applicable to all of
42 CFR Chapter IV and already defines ``provider''. A provider by definition agrees to participate in Medicare. We
proposed to add a definition of ``participating hospital'' and the remaining statutory definition, that of ``responsible
physician'', to 42 CFR Chapter V (Parts 1001 and 1003), since these terms are used in conjunction with monetary penalties,
which is under the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General. We discuss the proposed definition of ``responsible
physician'' below under ``Civil Monetary Penalties.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We proposed to amend 42 CFR Parts 489, 1001 and 1003 to provide for types of sanctions that would be applied by
the Department, as appropriate_ +&blank;Resolution of allegations and determination of liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the evidence available establishes that a hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to provide
the appropriate screening and treatment or transfer as explained above, it would be subject to either termination
of its provider agreement by HCFA in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act, or suspension of its provider agreement
by the OIG. In addition, the OIG could also impose civil monetary penalties for knowing violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Department receives a complaint, or any information or allegation, to the effect that a Medicare hospital
did not appropriately comply with the emergency medical screening, stabilizing, treatment or transfer requirements,
HCFA would, upon receipt of all available information and evidence, conduct sufficient review to determine whether
the complaint falls within the jurisdiction of section 1867. If so, HCFA would consider the complaint a substantial
allegation and would investigate the allegation thoroughly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If complaints allege acts of discrimination in violation of the civil rights laws, HCFA will refer them to the Office
for Civil Rights. In the case of other complaints, HCFA would send each complainant a letter acknowledging receipt
of the complaint, advising him or her of his or her rights to consider independently the civil enforcement provisions
of section 1867 and stating that it will refer the complaint to other agencies if, during the complaint investigation,
it determines that the matter falls under the jurisdiction of other agencies. Thus, HCFA would refer a complaint to
the Office for Civil Rights if it determines that a hospital may be in violation of the Hill-Burton Subpart G Community
Service regulations at 42 CFR 124.603(b)(1), which require Medicare participating hospitals that receive Hill-Burton
construction grants and loans to provide emergency medical services to any person who resides (or, in the case of some
hospitals, works) in the hospital's designated health service area. HCFA would, of course, inform complainants
of the outcome of its investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA would notify State Medicaid authorities, State licensing bodies, the Office of Inspector General, appropriate
PROs and the Office for Civil Rights concerning all complaint investigations and all termination actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA would determine whether the hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to comply with the requirement
of &sect;489.24 based on evidence of: (a) Inadequate treatment or treatment not being provided; (b) patients in unstable
condition or in active labor not being properly transferred as defined in &sect;489.24(d)(2); (c) the hospital's
actions, or lack of actions, causing a patient's or infant's death or serious or permanent impairment to a patient's
bodily functions; or (d) a hospital's actions placing a patient's health in serious jeopardy. HCFA would determine
the hospital to have been negligent if the hospital and its personnel failed to exercise care that should normally
be supplied to a patient experiencing an emergency medical condition or active labor as defined in &sect;489.24(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Termination of a provider agreement by HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA's termination authority under this provision was designed so that quick action may be taken to protect Medicare
beneficiaries and other individuals from any potential harm. The termination of a provider agreement was to be the
initial action contemplated against a hospital that knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to meet the
requirements set forth in &sect;489.24. This section would allow for the termination of the hospital's provider
agreement under Medicare in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act. The termination requirement was to be contained
in &sect;489.24(e). (The authority to terminate has been delegated from HHS through the HCFA Administrator to HCFA
Regional Offices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA was to revise &sect;489.53, Termination by HCFA, to include in paragraph (b) failure to comply with the requirements
of &sect;489.24 as a mandatory cause for termination of a provider agreement. HCFA would also revise paragraph (c)
to state that, if it determines that a hospital is in violation of &sect;489.24(a) through (d), HCFA would usually
consider the violation to pose an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of persons presenting themselves
to the hospital for emergency services and would terminate the hospital's approval for Medicare participation within
2 days of the determination unless the violation is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances in which HCFA determined that a hospital was in violation of the requirements of the Act, it would
initiate termination action. When that action was resolved, HCFA would refer the case to the OIG for possible imposition
of civil monetary penalties. If the OIG, upon further investigation, discovered past violations that did not form
the basis of the termination action, it could decide that a sanction is warranted and exercise its authority to impose
a suspension against the reinstated provider. (See the next section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In instances where HCFA found no violation, and therefore did not take an action, the closed case would still be transmitted
to the OIG. If the OIG, upon reviewing the case file, believed that further case development was warranted, it would
be free to do so. If OIG's investigation indicated that there were additional violations that were not reflected in
HCFA's case file, it would refer the new case information back to HCFA with a recommendation on whether HCFA should
terminate the hospital's provider agreement based on the new findings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether or not HCFA took a termination action on a given case, all investigated cases were to be referred to the OIG for
possible imposition of civil monetary penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Suspension of a provider agreement by the OIG and imposition of civil monetary penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed for the OIG to suspend providers, impose monetary penalties on violators and exclude responsible physicians.
The proposed rule stated that the OIG would not be precluded from suspending a hospital if, upon further investigation,
it determined there were additional violations of section 1867 beyond those warranting the HCFA termination that
indicated a pattern of dumping more widespread than initially believed by HCFA, or that additional instances of dumping
were so egregious that a penalty of suspension was appropriate. In addition, the proposed rule stated that the OIG
could also impose a civil monetary penalty (of not more than $50,000 per violation) for a hospital knowingly violating
the screening, treatment and transfer requirements of the statute and a civil monetary penalty (also of not more than
$50,000) against each responsible physician. The proposed regulations also stated that, in addition to imposing
civil monetary penalties, the OIG may exclude the responsible physician from Medicare participation for up to five
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress repealed the suspension authority in section 4008(b) of OBRA 90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Civil enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual who suffers personal harm, or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss, as a direct result of
the hospital's violation of a requirement in &sect;489.24, may bring a civil action, in an appropriate Federal district
court, against the hospital for damages and other equitable relief as appropriate. No civil action may be brought
more than 2 years after the date of the violation. The Federal district court will apply the law of the State in which
the hospital is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We continue to believe that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to revise the regulations to reflect this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Preemption of State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation provides that it does not preempt State or local law except where there is a conflict with the statutory
provision. Since Federal law ordinarily supersedes State law where there is a conflict, it was not necessary to propose
this provision for the regulations.

2. Responsibilities of Hospitals Receiving Improperly Transferred Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary findings of a study being conducted by the OIG (``Patient Dumping After COBRA: Assessing the Incidences
and the Perspectives of Health Care Professionals'' (August 1988)) confirmed that a number of individuals in unstable
condition have been transferred improperly and that the cases were not reported to HCFA. Because we needed to know
about all improper transfers, we proposed to add new paragraphs &sect;489.20(g) and &sect;489.24(f) to require
a hospital that suspects it may have received an improperly transferred individual to promptly report the matter
to HCFA and to the State survey agency. To be in compliance with this requirement, the receiving hospital would have
to report any suspected incident within 72 hours of its occurrence; this requirement would appear in manual instructions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to add material to &sect;489.53(a) to show that failure to report improper transfers may subject
the receiving hospital to termination of its provider agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances in which HCFA determines that a hospital is in violation of &sect;489.20(g) and &sect;489.24(f),
we proposed to initiate termination action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. State Survey Agency Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preliminary findings of the OIG study previously cited also identified incidents of improper transfer being
reported to the State survey agency that were not then reported to HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure that we are aware of all instances of improper transfer, we also proposed to require the State survey agencies
to report promptly any credible complaints (that is, complaints that are specific and detailed enough to be investigated)
related to violations of section 1867 of the Act. Therefore, we intended to revise &sect;405.1903 (recodified as
&sect;488.18), Documentation of findings, by adding a new paragraph (d) that would require State survey agencies
to inform HCFA of credible reports of violations of &sect;489.24.

A. Participation in the CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA and VA Health Care Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received comments from nine commenters concerning the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA and VA issues. They were from hospitals,
professional organizations and one individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raised numerous issues relating to the operations of the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs and the operation
of the prospective payment system under those programs (CHAMPVA payments are made under CHAMPUS' DRG-based payment
system). The issues concerned such items as the status of hospitals operating under demonstration programs conducted
by those programs, and the obligation of CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA patients for making cost-share amounts required under
those programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these regulations is to require hospitals that participate in Medicare to participate as well in the
CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA and VA programs. These regulations do not relate to rules under which those programs function and
do not make any changes in their operations. We have referred questions concerning operational issues to appropriate
administrative officials at OCHAMPUS who assure us that providers who are participating in the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative
area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be forced to accept payment less than the DRG amounts. They also tell us that the adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized amount used in the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system contains a factor to reimburse hospitals for CHAMPUS'
share of the hospitals' bad debts. These regulations do not change the beneficiary's obligation to pay required cost-share
amounts.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters stated that the provider's freedom of choice in making management decisions of participating or
not in these additional programs would be taken away by implementing these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislation clearly ties participation in Medicare to acceptance, as well, of the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA participation
responsibility. We recognize that this change in the law alters the range of discretion that a hospital may have in
selecting participation options but the law offers no alternative to accepting all the programs or declining to participate
in Medicare.

One commenter believed that, as a provider of services to CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA and VA beneficiaries for many years, his
institution has the right to receive a notice of government action and have a chance to respond to the government decision-making.
He received no notice of government action until reading this notice of proposed rulemaking.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 et seq.), it is the notice of proposed rulemaking that is the vehicle
for providing notice of this type of government action. Should a provider be subject to termination for not being in
compliance with requirements added by this rule, we believe the procedures for termination by HCFA located at &sect;489.53
are fundamentally fair. These procedures include our proposed rules under &sect;489.53(a)(11) that allow HCFA
to terminate an agreement with any provider, if HCFA finds that the provider no longer meets the appropriate conditions
of participation such as those found in new &sect;489.25 or &sect;489.26, which address providing medical services
to CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA or VA beneficiaries. Before we find a hospital in violation, we expect, as discussed in the preamble
of the proposed rule, that efforts to resolve any problem will have taken place. If problems are not resolved then the
actual notice of termination procedures listed in &sect;489.53(c) will be initiated.

Four commenters stated that third party payors, such as Medicaid and CHAMPUS, pay smaller and smaller proportions
of the costs these hospitals incur in serving those covered by these programs. In their view, if hospitals are to continue
to provide full access, then Congress, HCFA, the Department of Defense, and State governments must recognize their
responsibility to adequately finance the care that they require to be provided.

We believe that the prospective payment system results in fair payments. As implemented under Medicare, the prospective
payment system differentiates payments by location and type of provider as well as by the relative resource intensity
of individual cases. The CHAMPUS and VA DRG-payment systems are similar to that used by Medicare; however, they have
been tailored to their own health care utilization patterns. Under a prospective payment system, many of the operational
costs have been factored into the DRG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have been informed that under the CHAMPUS DRG-payment system the cost sharing provisions have been changed to ensure
that the amount of the shared cost incurred by the beneficiary will be more equitable. In fact, we have learned that
most beneficiaries will pay less under this new system than the old, and no beneficiary is expected to pay more in cost
share amounts. As under the Medicare prospective payment system, annual evaluations to recalculate DRG weights
are taking place under the CHAMPUS DRG-based system using the most recent period of CHAMPUS data. During annual evaluations,
consideration can be given to any problems which have surfaced.

and amounts that the VA provides for those hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital care to veterans whose care has
been authorized or will be sponsored by the VA. As noted in section I.B. of this preamble, this rule was developed jointly
by VA and HHS, and the VA payment system conforms to Medicare's inpatient hospital prospective payment system in most
cases.

One commenter believes that, at a minimum, disproportionate share providers should receive special protection.
He stated that since Congress recognized that additional Medicare payments under the prospective payment system
should be made to hospitals that admit a disproportionate share of low-income patients, a similar disproportionate
share status may be necessary to protect Medicare providers located in areas surrounding military bases or other
military installations.

The preamble to the final rule implementing the CHAMPUS DRG-Based Payment System (52 FR 32992) provides information
to suggest that there should not be a disproportionate number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries seeking care in Medicare participating
hospitals (civilian hospitals). Specifically, when discussing ``emergency treatment'' (page 32996, first column),
it states that ``*&blank;*&blank;*all CHAMPUS beneficiaries who live within catchment areas of military treatment
facilities (MTFs) are required to first seek inpatient care at the MTF before going to a civilian hospital*&blank;*&blank;*''
The catchment area is defined as within 40 miles of an MTF. On the other hand, however, we have been informed that CHAMPVA
beneficiaries are not eligible for care in MTFs; therefore, they must use either VA or civilian hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the payment rates under CHAMPUS are adequate to pay for treatment of its enrolled population. If the commenter
believes otherwise he should furnish the VA with data on this matter and present detailed findings to support the need
for a suggested adjustment to payment rates.

The joint regulations to which the statute refers are regulations establishing payment procedures and amounts,
not regulations requiring participation. Such regulations have already been published (55 FR 42848 for VA and 52
FR 32992 for CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA). In addition, we consulted on these regulations with pertinent members of OCHAMPUS
and VA before publication; thus, these regulations are also a joint action. They are also prospective, not retroactive.

We do not believe that most of these methods would serve the purpose Congress intended. Posting a sign could still result
in many, if not most, beneficiaries not noticing it at all; a mass mailing would be untimely for most patients and thus
subject to being ignored. Moreover, the law requires that the notice be furnished by the hospital. Finally, many admissions
are not planned or occur with little advance notice; so, having the hospital mail the statement before admission would
be a viable method of informing some but not all beneficiaries of their discharge rights on a timely basis. We note,
however, that hospitals may choose this approach with patients whose admissions are planned in advance.

The law is self-implementing; that is, it did not require public comment or regulations in order to be implemented.
However, we did consult extensively with major beneficiary and provider organizations (such as the Gray Panthers,
American Hospital Association, and the American Association of Retired Persons) and have subsequently revised
the final version of ``An Important Message from Medicare'' (the ``Message'') after these consultations.

One commenter stated that the ``Message'' is inadequate, especially as it pertains to discharge planning, and suggested
either a separate notice or an expanded notice to focus on the discharge planning requirements of section 1861(e)(6)
of the Act. Another commenter asserted that the original ``Message'' was poorly written, as it tries to cover legal
requirements. The commenter also asserted that there is a need for the ``Message'' to be more supportive and informative.

The revised ``Message'' contains several references to the availability of hospital discharge planning and the
need to consult a physician or appropriate hospital staff for assistance. Beneficiaries have a current need for the
``Message,'' and we do not believe it would have been appropriate to delay its distribution until after the condition
of participation for discharge planning, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be included in our regulations at &sect;482.43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see 53 FR 22506, June 16, 1988), is published as a final rule. Requiring a notice of hospital discharge rights and requiring
hospitals to provide a discharge planning process are two separate statutory provisions of OBRA 86 that were not meant
to be combined. Further, Congress did not specify explicitly in section 1866(a)(1)(M) that discharge planning should
be included in the notice. We have revised the original ``Message'' to improve its readability as well as its content.
We note that it has always been our intention to revise the ``Message'' in the future as patient needs change.

We received four comments, all from beneficiary organizations, in favor of our requirement that the hospital obtain
a signed acknowledgement of the discharge rights notice. We also received 17 comments against it, primarily from
hospitals and hospital organizations. Four of these commenters stated that there is no need for this requirement.
They cited HCFA's statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that, ``we believe we already have full cooperation
from hospitals.''

We strongly believe that the requirement that a hospital furnish a statement concerning discharge rights to each
Medicare beneficiary must be fully met. However, we are persuaded by the commenters that full compliance has already
been achieved in most hospitals. Therefore, we have eliminated the requirement for a signed acknowledgement. In
its place, we now specify under &sect;489.27 that a hospital must be able to demonstrate that it complies with the requirement
that each beneficiary be furnished with a discharge rights notice at or about the time of admission. We note, however,
that signed acknowledgements could be required as part of a plan of correction for a hospital that was found to be out
of compliance with this requirement.

In conjunction with the elimination of the signed acknowledgement requirement, we have deleted the accompanying
retention requirement from this interim final rule. When we published the proposed rule, our PRO program was oriented
towards review of hospital medical records, and so we chose initially to implement the discharge rights requirement
specifically in terms of an acknowledgement in the medical record. More recently, however, we have reoriented our
PRO program towards efforts more likely to bring about general improvements in quality and have minimized our funding
of more limited ``process'' requirements such as review of individual medical records. Accordingly, we recognize
that the proposed acknowledgement and retention requirements have become obsolete and are eliminating them. Again,
the final rule does require hospitals to demonstrate compliance with the discharge rights notification requirement,
but does not specify the manner of compliance. We expect some hospitals may continue to seek and retain signed acknowledgements
but believe they should have other, less burdensome, options as well.

Eight commenters believed that this requirement would be a burden on the beneficiary and his or her family as there
are already too many forms to complete at admission; one commenter felt that securing a signed acknowledgement would
do little to improve beneficiary attention to the ``Message'' because it is the presence of a problem, rather than
the presence of the notice, that generates beneficiary attention to discharge rights issues.

We realize that being admitted to a hospital is a stressful event for patients and their families. As noted above, we
have removed the requirement for a signed and dated acknowledgement, in part because of its impact on beneficiaries.

In addition to the concerns discussed above, commenters also addressed specific aspects of the requirement that
hospitals obtain and retain signed acknowledgement statements. For example, one commenter suggested that we require
that the date and time of the patient's signature on the acknowledgement statement be recorded; another recommended
that the acknowledgement statement be accompanied by an additional statement that signing the acknowledgement
in no way compromises a patient's discharge rights; another suggested that the acknowledgement specify that the
beneficiary has been given the name of an individual at the hospital who is available to explain the ``Message.'' Similarly,
commenters asked that we specify where, in what form, and for how long acknowledgements be retained. Finally, several
commenters recommended that we allow hospitals as much flexibility as possible in implementing the acknowledgement
and retention requirements.

Given that we have decided to eliminate the requirement for a signed acknowledgement and its retention, most of these
comments are now moot. Thus, we agree with the commenters who believe that hospitals should be given maximum flexibility
in determining how they can best comply with the requirement that all beneficiaries be furnished with a notice of discharge
rights. We do not intend to specify the actual mechanics of having this notice presented to patients. Instead, we expect
individual hospitals to exercise their own discretion in dealing with the associated administrative issues. We
emphasize that, for survey purposes, hospitals that do not choose to obtain and retain signed acknowledgement statements
must be able to document compliance by some other means with the requirement for timely distribution of the discharge
rights notice.

We do not agree that the regulations themselves should address these situation. Such situations will be relatively
rare. Hospitals will need to be in compliance with applicable State statutes in dealing with informing patients who
cannot receive information on their own behalf. Program instructions are a more appropriate vehicle for discussing

HCFA carries out a variety of activities to educate beneficiaries and will continue to do so. However, section 1866(a)(1)(M)
of the Act requires that this explanation of patient rights be provided by the hospital. This is an appropriate hospital
responsibility since inpatient hospital care is under the control of the hospital and the patient looks to the hospital
for information about rights and options concerning care. Also, these rights are related to discharge planning,
which is most appropriately a hospital function.

Although a hospital may be terminated for failing to meet our requirements we will not institute termination before
providing an opportunity for correction. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the speed with which we move
to termination would depend on HCFA's judgment as to the scope of the failure and the hospital's correction or plan
for correction of the failure. This approach will be reflected in implementing program instructions.

C. Hospital Responsibility for Emergency Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received comments from 68 commenters on the anti-dumping provisions as they existed before the passage of OBRA
89. Commenters included hospitals, professional health organizations, State hospital associations and medical
societies, State agencies, physicians, attorneys and other individuals. We have taken into account the OBRA 89 and
OBRA 90 statutory changes when responding to the comments we received, and we are adding the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 requirements
to this interim final rule. We are doing this without publishing a second notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining
to the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 requirements because we believe the extensive detail of the statute makes many provisions
self-executing and because commenters suggested changes similar to many of those embodied in the legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Please note that, with respect to the anti-dumping provisions, the statute now uses the term ``individual'' and
not ``patient.'' While our response to comments refers to ``individuals,'' we have not made the parallel change when
the term ``patient'' appears in a commenter's statement.)

A number of commenters suggested that HCFA require hospitals to post signs in their emergency departments advising
patients of the hospital's obligation to provide emergency care. Two other commenters recommended that we require
emergency room personnel to give emergency room patients both written and oral notice of the hospital's obligations
and the patient's rights under these regulations.

The provisions of section 1867 of the Act address what is appropriate performance on the part of hospitals in meeting
medical needs of individuals who need emergency services. Additionally, as amended by section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA
89, section 1866(a)(1)(N)(iii) of the Act explicitly directs the Secretary to require Medicare participating hospitals
to post conspicuously in all emergency departments a sign (in a form specified by the Secretary) specifying rights
of individuals under section 1867 of the Act with respect to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions
and women in labor. Further, since some hospitals do not have traditional emergency departments, we are amending
&sect;489.20 to include a new paragraph (q)(1) to reflect this statutory requirement and to specify other hospital
areas in which such signs should be posted. It should be noted that Medicare participating hospitals that do not offer
emergency services do not have to comply with this requirement. However, all hospitals do have to comply with the provision
of section 1866(a)(1)(N)(iv) of the Act, as also amended by section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, that directs hospitals
to post conspicuously (in a form specified by the Secretary) information indicating whether or not the hospital participates
in the Medicaid program under a State plan approved under title XIX. (See &sect;489.20(q)(2).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have also published an interim manual instruction (IMI)(IM&hyph;90&hyph;1, June 1990) in HCFA Pub. 10, the Medicare
Hospital Manual, listing minimum criteria for the signs and an example of language for this sign that would meet such
criteria. We are including the IMI language as shown in the IMI exhibit for informational purposes in Appendix II to
this final rule and request comments on the exhibit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the statutory requirement for the posting of signs, which does not also require individual written
or oral notice, is adequate for the general purpose of informing patients of their rights to a medical screening and
stabilizing treatment under the anti-dumping statute. This is consistent with the overall drafting of section 1867
of the Act, which specifically requires individual notice in other situations such as consent to transfer. Accordingly,
when an individual's specific treatment is involved, we agree with the commenters that it is essential for patients
to be fully informed about all the critical medical issues with which they are faced. That is why we require a more detailed
process for ensuring that hospitals obtain the informed consent of an individual who is faced with the prospect of
a transfer. (See &sect;489.24(c).) In such cases, we agree that both oral and written interaction are necessary.

A number of commenters objected to our proposal concerning furnishing emergency services on the grounds that our
rule applies to all patients (rather than Medicare patients only). They believe that any problems were of limited
scope and noted that implementation of the requirement will establish an adversarial relationship among HCFA, providers,
and patients.

The protections of the statute are expressly extended to all individuals who come to a facility regardless of whether
the individual is eligible for benefits under Medicare. The Federal Government has always viewed that a provider's
obligation is to all persons, regardless of entitlement. This obligation has been well understood and universally
applied to all providers. Congress, in apparent awareness of this universal obligation, has in some instances limited
the scope of a provider's obligation. An example of this is discharge planning, as provided under section 1861(ee)
of the Act, which limits the scope of this requirement specifically to individuals covered under the Act. Since Congress
has not chosen to narrow the scope of section 1867 by limiting it only to persons entitled to benefits under the Act,
we are confident that the provisions of section 1867 of the Act extend to all persons.

We believe that section 1867 of the Act also applies to all individuals who attempt to gain access to the hospital for
emergency care. An individual may not be denied services simply because the person failed to actually enter the facility's
designated emergency department. To read the statute in such a narrow fashion would in our view frustrate the objectives
of the statute in many cases and lead to arbitrary results. For the same reason, a facility may not prevent an individual
from gaining access to the facility in order to circumvent these requirements. If an individual is on a facility's
property, which includes ambulances owned and operated by the facility, even if the ambulance is not on hospital property,
and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, we believe the
statute reasonably requires the facility to provide a screening examination and treatment or transfer in accordance
with section 1867 of the statute. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property is considered
to have come to the hospital's emergency department. However, an individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance located
off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department if someone staffing the
ambulance contacts the hospital by telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want
to transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment. This is in accordance with the recent court
decision that, for purposes of section 1867 of the Act, a hospital-operated telemetry system is distinct from the
same hospital's emergency department. (See

1992 U.S. App. Lexis 25096 (7th Cir. 1992).) Thus, the hospital may deny such access when it is in ``diversionary''
status because it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients at that time. However,
if the ambulance disregards the hospital's instructions and does bring the individual on to hospital grounds the
hospital cannot deny the individual access to hospital services whether or not the hospital is in ``diversionary''
status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters noted that these requirements could have a greater impact on some hospitals than on others.
For example, rural hospitals would have a greater recordkeeping burden in documenting transfers because they have
smaller emergency room (ER) staffs; hospitals with high ER rates for non-Medicare or Medicaid patients would have
to provide care for which these programs will not directly compensate, and some hospitals will have to accept larger
numbers of indigent patients presenting themselves for treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law specifically applies to all hospitals that participate in Medicare and that offer emergency services. We
have, therefore, inserted the following definition in &sect;489.24(b): ``Hospital with an emergency department
means a hospital that offers services for emergency medical conditions (as defined in this paragraph) within its
capability to do so.'' It is also clear that the statute only requires hospitals that offer emergency services to provide
screening and stabilizing treatment within the scope of their capabilities (sections 1867(a) and (b) of the Act).
We acknowledge, however, that any participating hospital providing emergency services, regardless of size or patient
mix, must provide screening and stabilizing treatment, as needed, to individuals who present themselves for examination
or treatment. We recognize that this could create uneven uncompensated care burdens on some hospitals because of
larger than usual concentrations of indigent patients; however, we do not believe that this will often be the case.
Since the requirements apply to all 6,700 Medicare participating hospitals, among 7,000 U.S. hospitals offering
emergency services, we also believe that the statute will lighten the burden on some hospitals now subject to increased
patient loads due to inappropriate transfers because patients are more likely to be treated and stabilized at the
hospitals where they first present themselves for treatment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters stated that a hospital should not be required to designate in its by-laws which personnel are qualified
to perform the initial medical screening examination because it is unreasonable to require a hospital to amend its
by-laws. A recommendation was made that those personnel qualified to perform screening examinations be approved
by the medical director of the emergency department. Another recommendation was made that those personnel qualified
to perform screening examinations be set forth in the rules and regulations governing the medical staff and not the
by-laws.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is important to require the hospital to determine formally what type of personnel is qualified to perform the initial
medical screening examinations because such a formal determination will insure that the hospital's governing body
recognizes the ``capability of the hospital'' and is properly accountable for this function. For this reason, we
believe that the delegation should be set forth in a document that is approved by the governing body of the hospital,
rather than merely allowing the medical director of the emergency department to make what may be informal delegations
that could frequently change. If the rules and regulations are approved by the board of trustees or other governing
body, we agree that those personnel qualified to perform these examinations may be set forth in the rules and regulations,
instead of placing this information in the hospital by-laws. We are amending &sect;489.24(a) to reflect this change.
Although we are requiring the hospital to specify in its by-laws or its rules and regulations who is a ``qualified medical
person'' for purposes of providing an appropriate medical screening examination, this does not mean that HHS must
accept the hospital's specification when determining whether an appropriate medical screening examination was
done. So, for example, if a hospital specifies that a nurse is always the ``qualified medical person'' who should do
the medical screening examination, HHS may, in some instances, determine that there was not an appropriate medical
screening examination because the condition of the individual required the expertise of a physician to determine
whether that individual had an emergency medical condition.

We have included this language in the regulations at &sect;489.24(c)(3). However, we note that we believe that it
means hospitals may continue to follow reasonable registration processes for emergency room individuals, including
requesting information about insurance, as long as these procedures do not impede provision of necessary treatment
and as long as all individuals to whom the procedures apply are treated similarly. That is, all individuals who have
an emergency medical condition are served regardless of the answers they may give to insurance questions asked during
routine admissions screening. A hospital should not delay treatment to any individual while it verifies information
provided.

 Section 1867(a) of the Act provides that a hospital must give an appropriate medical screening examination to all
individuals who come to the emergency department and request examination or treatment. While it may be prudent for
a hospital to require a physician to conduct this screening examination in every instance, there may be hospitals,
especially rural primary care hospitals, in which a physician is not available to provide a medical screening examination.
Even when physicians are present in the hospital, there may be circumstances that are so clearly not emergency medical
conditions that other qualified medical personnel may conduct the initial screening examination. However, although
it is up to the hospital to determine under what circumstances a physician is required to perform an appropriate medical
screening examination, that does not mean that HHS must accept the hospital's determination of what circumstances
require that the screening exam be performed by a physician.

 It is impossible to define in advance all of the circumstances in which an individual may come to a hospital emergency
department. What constitutes an appropriate medical screening examination will vary according to the condition
and past history of the individual and the capabilities of the hospital's emergency department_both its facilities
and available personnel. Within those capabilities, the examination must be sufficient to permit the hospital to
decide whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition. Because the law does not require hospitals,
among which there are variations in staffing and procedures, to adopt standard procedures or use standard staffing
to meet these requirements, determinations about whether a hospital is in compliance with these regulations must
be based on the facts in each individual case.

 The regulations presently allow a hospital to delegate its responsibility to perform initial medical screening
examinations to qualified medical personnel if it does so in its by-laws or in its rules and regulations. Such a delegation
must also be consistent with the provisions of &sect;482.55 with respect to emergency services personnel. Obviously,
the Department cannot anticipate every situation in which an individual with an emergency medical condition may
come to an emergency department. Hence, we cannot state unequivocally that an examination by a nurse or other non-physician
medical personnel will be appropriate under all circumstances.

 No revision is necessary. A hospital is only required to treat individuals with the staff and facilities available
at the hospital. Under &sect;482.55(b)(2), a hospital must have available ``adequate medical and nursing personnel
qualified in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility.'' Subject
to the discussion below concerning on-call physicians, if the hospital does not have at its disposal the personnel
or equipment necessary to stabilize a particular person's emergency medical condition, section 1867(c)(1) of the
Act permits an unstabilized individual to be transferred if (a) the individual or the individual's representative
has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and requests the transfer in writing; or (b) the individual
has not refused an appropriate transfer and the physician signs a written certification that the benefits of appropriate
treatment at another facility outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.

 One commenter recommended that the services of on-call physicians should be considered in determining the capabilities

may be necessary to stabilize the emergency medical condition or treat the labor. Another asked that the regulations
specify that a hospital is deemed to be capable of providing emergency services in all fields in which the hospital

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that on-call physicians and ancillary services should be considered available to the hospital. This was
further clarified in section 6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89, which amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Act to require hospitals
to maintain a list of physicians who are on call and available to provide treatment needed to stabilize individuals
with emergency medical conditions. Accordingly, we have amended &sect;489.20 to include a new paragraph (r)(2)
requiring hospitals to comply with this OBRA 89 provision. The statute (as revised by COBRA, OBRA 89, and OBRA 90) and
the current regulations state that the hospital must provide a medical screening examination, within the capability
of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department,
to determine if the patient has an emergency medical condition. If a hospital chooses to meet its responsibility under
&sect;482.55 to provide adequate medical personnel to meet its anticipated emergency needs by using on-call physicians
either to staff or to augment its emergency department, then the capability of its emergency department includes
the services of its on-call physicians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute (as revised by COBRA, OBRA 89, and OBRA 90) and current regulations also require the hospital to provide
whatever further examination and treatment are necessary to stabilize the medical condition or to provide for treatment
of the labor within the staff and facilities available at the hospital. If a staff physician is on call to provide emergency
services or to consult with an emergency room physician in the areas of his or her expertise, that physician would be
considered to be available at the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also believe that when COBRA was enacted, Congress intended that the resources of the hospital and the staff generally
available to patients at the hospital would be considered available for the examination and treatment of individuals
coming to the hospital's emergency department, regardless of whether staff physicians had heretofore been obligated
by the hospital to provide services to those coming to the hospital's emergency department. This was also clarified
by section 6211(a) of OBRA 89, which specifies that the capability of hospital emergency departments must include
``ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.'' Therefore, if a hospital has a department
of obstetrics and gynecology, the hospital is responsible for adopting procedures under which the staff and resources
of that department are available to treat a woman in labor who comes to its emergency department.

 Neither the statute nor the regulations mandate that hospitals expand their resources or offer more services. Rather,
they focus on a hospital's existing capabilities. The thrust of the statute is that a hospital that offers emergency
services to some members of a community who need their emergency services (for example, those that can pay) cannot
deny such services to other members of the community with a similar need.

As previously indicated, the statute and the regulations specifically state that the hospital must provide treatment
that is within the capabilities of the staff and facilities it has available. If a hospital does not have the capability
to treat psychiatric disorders or a small rural hospital lacks the staff or resources to treat certain emergencies,
it must determine whether the benefits to an individual's medical condition outweigh the risks associated with transferring
the individual. If a physician certifies that the benefits of transfer to a more suitable facility outweigh the risks,
the hospital may transfer the individual to a facility that has the capability to treat that individual and agrees
to accept transfer. The certification may be signed by a qualified medical person if a physician is not physically
present in the emergency department and that qualified medical person first consults with a physician who later countersigns
the certification. Also, a person seeking medical treatment may make an informed decision to request transfer to
such a facility.

 Any participating hospital that offers emergency services is liable for violations of the statute regardless of
whether it is a small rural hospital or a major metropolitan tertiary care facility with a trauma center. The statute
requires any subject hospital to provide for treatment within the capabilities of the staff and facility it has available.
However, hospitals with fewer than 100 State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds are subject to a maximum civil monetary
penalty of $25,000, as compared to a maximum civil monetary penalty of $50,000 for hospitals with 100 or more State-licensed,
Medicare-certified beds.

 The statute and these regulations apply only to hospitals that participate in the Medicare program and that offer
emergency services. HHS considers any participating hospital that provides emergency services to have an emergency
department and thus to be subject to the provisions of the statute and these regulations. However, even a Medicare
participating hospital that does not provide emergency services must continue to meet the standard of &sect;482.12(f),
which requires hospitals to have written policies and procedures for appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment,
and referral where appropriate. Also, to our knowledge, college infirmaries are not hospitals having Medicare provider
agreements and are thus not subject to section 1867 of the Act.

 One commenter noted that in the proposed regulations and COBRA, the term ``hospital'' is defined as ``a Medicare facility
certified as a hospital with its own provider number.'' The commenter recommended that the definition be expanded
to require that the transfer be made to the ``nearest appropriate facility'' that happens to be a Medicare provider,
so that Medicare providers will be required to receive transfers from other hospitals.

 The intent of the statute is to provide equal treatment for all individuals who come to a hospital and request a medical
screening examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition, as well as to provide for protected transfers
of individuals who have unstabilized emergency medical conditions. Such individuals are at the greatest risk of
severe physical impairment, dysfunction, or delivery of a baby in the absence of immediate medical attention. We
believe that after assessing an individual's medical condition and weighing the risks versus benefits of effectuating
an appropriate transfer to another facility, the amount of travel time required to transport the individual should
be considered. Situations will occur where an individual's condition requires a hospital to effectuate a transfer
to the nearest appropriate facility that has the capability and capacity to treat in order to minimize the risks to
the individual by reducing the transportation time as much as possible. Transfer of an unstabilized patient to a hospital
with which there is a prior transfer agreement can be justified when the condition of the unstabilized individual
is such that the additional travel time would not increase the danger to the patient.

 Two commenters believe that we should define emergency department to include the provision of emergency services,
as not all hospitals have a formal ``emergency department.''

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that section 1867 of the Act applies to all Medicare participating facilities that offer emergency services.
It was not Congress' intent to limit the scope of the provision to only those facilities that have organized areas specifically
labelled as emergency departments or emergency rooms. If so, a facility could easily circumvent its responsibilities
under the Act simply by renaming the department to something other than ``emergency department'' or by using an approach
other than departmentalization in providing hospital services. This would clearly contravene the underlying principle
of the statute that obligates hospitals to render emergency care within their capacity when they normally undertake
to render such care in individual cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, many psychiatric hospitals do not have organized emergency departments. However, many of these facilities
offer 24-hour psychiatric services on a walk-in basis for persons who are not patients of the hospital. Although these
hospitals do not have organized emergency departments, they are presenting themselves to the public as providing
care for psychiatric emergencies. We believe this type of facility must comply with the requirements of section 1867
of the Act and render emergency care within their capability to do so (or provide for a transfer in accordance with section
1867(c) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify this issue, we believe it is helpful if the regulations define the term ``hospital with an emergency
department'' to clarify which hospitals are subject to the requirements of section 1867. Therefore, as we previously
indicated, we have inserted in &sect;489.24(b) the definition of a hospital with an emergency department.

 One commenter stated that proposed &sect;489.24(c) (2) and (3) are inconsistent in that an individual's refusal
to consent to treatment must be in writing, but a refusal to consent to transfer does not. Other commenters urged HCFA
to require that refusals to consent to treatment be in writing and that they reflect that the individual, or a legally
responsible person acting on his or her behalf, understands the hospital's obligations under the statute and is aware
of the risks of refusing treatment.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that the decision to refuse or consent to treatment must be an informed one, and we believe that the hospital
is obliged to inform the individual (or the person requesting examination or treatment on his or her behalf) of the
reasonably foreseeable risks and benefits of refusing or consenting to treatment. Sections 6211(b) (1) and (2) of
OBRA 89 amended section 1867(b) of the Act to require hospitals to inform individuals (or persons acting on their behalf)
of the risks and benefits to the individual of examination and treatment and/or transfer, and to ``take all reasonable
steps to secure the individual's (or person's) written informed consent to refuse such examination and treatment,''
transfer, or both. We are therefore amending &sect;489.24(c) (2) and (4) to comply with these OBRA 89 requirements.
Thus, the medical record should contain a description of the examination and treatment offered to the individual.
We also believe that hospitals should not attempt to coerce individuals into making judgments against their best
interest by informing them that they will have to pay for their care if they remain, but that their care will be free or
at low cost if they transfer to a charity hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that hospitals generally require an individual's consent to treatment to be in writing. (See
&sect;482.24(c)(2)(v) requiring properly executed informed consent forms for procedures and treatments specified
by hospital medical staff or Federal or State law requirements.)

 We agree and, based upon this comment and section 6211(c)(1) of OBRA 89, are revising &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(A)
to provide that requests for transfer must be in writing and signed by the individual requesting the transfer or by
a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf. The requests should contain a brief statement of
the hospital's obligations under the statute and the benefits and risks that were outlined to the person signing the
request. The request should be made a part of the patient's medical record, and a copy of it should be sent to the receiving
facility along with the individual transferred. It is reasonable to conclude that, by permitting requests for transfer
to be made only by the individual or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, Congress intended
requests to be documented in the manner suggested by the commenter. Moreover, this requirement will reduce litigation
about whether an individual requested the transfer.

Three commenters suggested we specify in the regulations what constitutes a certification that a transfer is in the
patient's best interests. They asked if an entry in the patient's medical record would be sufficient certification.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before an unstabilized individual may be transferred in the absence of a request for transfer, the statute requires
a physician to sign a certification that based upon the information available at the time, the medical benefits reasonably
expected from appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual
and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child, from effecting the transfer. If a physician is not physically present
in the emergency department at the time of transfer, a qualified medical person may sign the certification after consulting
with a physician who later countersigns that certification. Section 1867(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, both
as added by COBRA (section 9121(b)) and revised by OBRA 89 (section 6211(c)(4)), requires an express written certification
by a physician or other qualified medical personnel attesting to the elements just delineated; the certification,
while it may be written explicitly into the medical record, cannot simply be inferred from the findings in the medical
record and the fact that the individual was transferred.

A hospital may violate [the certification] provision in four ways. First, before transfer, the hospital might fail
to secure the required signature from the appropriate medical personnel on a certification form. But the statute
requires more than a signature; it requires a signed certification. Thus, the hospital also violates the statute
if the signer has not actually deliberated and weighed the medical risks and the medical benefits of transfer before
executing the certification. Likewise, the hospital fails to make the certification required by 42 U.S.C. 1395dd(c)(1)(A)(ii)
if the signer makes an improper consideration a significant factor in the certification decision. Finally a hospital
violates the statute if the signer actually concludes in the weighing process that the medical risks outweigh the
medical benefits of transfer, yet signs a certification that the opposite is true.

Section 1867(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, as amended by section 6211(e) of OBRA 89, now allows imposition of civil monetary
penalties if the physician ``knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the risks.'' We are therefore
revising &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(B) to require that a certification state the reasons for the transfer and include
a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based. As the statute requires that a physician or other qualified
medical personnel in consultation with a physician weigh the benefits and risks associated with the transfer before
an unstabilized individual may be transferred, it should not be unduly burdensome for the physician or other medical
personnel to state the risks and benefits that have been weighed. It should be noted, however, that, under the statute,
the physician, not the qualified medical personnel, makes the transfer determination in all cases. The narrative
rationale need not be a lengthy discussion of the individual's medical condition reiterating facts already contained
in the medical record, but it should give a complete picture of the benefits to be expected from appropriate care at
the receiving facility and the risks associated with the transfer, including the time away from an acute care setting
necessary to effect the transfer.

Revised &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (formerly a part of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)) requires that the certification be
included in the individual's medical record and that it be sent to the receiving hospital along with the transferred
individual. We believe that this will assist the receiving hospitals in determining whether the individual was transferred
appropriately under the statute.

We see no need to revise these medical record requirements of the regulation. Records must accompany an individual
whether or not his or her condition is stabilized. Under &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (formerly paragraph (d)(2)(ii)),
hospitals transferring unstabilized individuals must provide the receiving facility with all medical records
related to the emergency condition for which the individual has presented in addition to other information required
by the statute and regulations. Under the current conditions of participation for hospitals (&sect;482.21(b)(2)),
all patients, including stabilized patients being discharged from hospitals to other facilities and agencies,
must be accompanied by necessary medical information. This is a routine requirement that was in place before the dumping

We agree with this comment, and section 6211(d)(2) of OBRA 89 amended section 1867(c)(2)(C) of the Act to address this
issue. The statute now directs transferring hospitals to send receiving hospitals all medical records related to
the individual's emergency condition ``available at the time of transfer'' (note next Comment and Response) and
specifically lists some of the information that should be included in these records. We have, therefore, amended
proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(ii) (now paragraph (d)(2)(iii)) to reflect the new legislative requirements. The
conditions of participation in &sect;482.24(c) contain other Federal requirements relating to medical records.
To the extent that services are performed before transfer we expect them to be reflected in the records transferred,
consistent with the conditions of participation. Although it may be desirable, depending on the patient's condition,
to send along records of previous admissions, the patient's transfer should not be delayed.

We agree with both points, and we have amended proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(ii) (now paragraph (d)(2)(iii)) accordingly
to require that a transferring hospital send with the transferred individual whatever records (including copies
of results of diagnostic studies or telephone reports of the studies) are available at the time and place of the transfer.
If a transfer is in an individual's best interests, it should not be delayed until records are retrieved or test results
come back from the laboratory. Whatever documents are available at the time the individual is transferred should
be sent to the receiving hospital with the individual. Test results that become available after the individual is
transferred should be telephoned to the receiving hospital. Records that become available after the patient is transferred,
such as hard copies of test results or relevant records of earlier admissions, for example, should be sent to the receiving
hospital as expeditiously as possible.

The regulations require hospitals to determine which of their personnel are qualified to certify, in consultation
with a physician who later countersigns, that a transfer is appropriate. This decision will vary among hospitals
and States as availability, qualifications, and practice limitations of a particular category of staff differ.
HCFA holds the governing body of a hospital responsible for assuring that its staff functions within the bounds of
State law and this and other federal health and safety regulations. Based upon these comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6211(c)(2)(D) of OBRA 89, we are amending &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(C) to specify that, if a physician is not
physically present in the emergency department at the time an individual is transferred, a qualified medical person
may sign a certification stating that the transfer is in the individual's best interest. However, the qualified medical
person may sign a transfer certification only after a physician, in consultation with the qualified medical person,
has made the determination to transfer. The physician must subsequently countersign the certification. The regulation
also provides that the hospital must determine who are ``other qualified medical personnel.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted us to recognize that requiring trained emergency medical technicians to accompany a patient
being transferred will meet the requirements that a transfer be effected through ``qualified personnel'' as required
under proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (now paragraph (d)(2)(iv)) because, in many communities, transfers are
made by volunteer rescue squads with trained emergency medical technicians.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot state unequivocally that emergency medical technicians are ``qualified personnel'' for purposes of transferring
an individual under these regulations. Depending on the individual's condition, there may be situations in which
a physician's presence, or some other specialist's presence, might be mandatory.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter proposed that we amend the regulations to clarify that the hospital is responsible for providing transportation
services, either directly or indirectly, stating that the proposed regulations did not address the need for the hospital
to provide transportation services to carry out the physician's orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The statute (section 1867(c)(2)(C) of the Act) imposes a duty on the hospital to ensure that the transfer
is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment. Frequently the determination of what equipment
and personnel will be required will be a medical decision. The hospital by-laws, rules and regulations, or State law
may dictate that the decision be made by the transferring physician. If the hospital delegates its duty under the statute
to the transferring physician, both the hospital and physician would be obligated to ensure that the transfer is effected
through qualified personnel and necessary equipment. To say that the hospital is ultimately responsible for ensuring
that the transfer is appropriately effected is not, however, to dictate the means by which it meets that responsibility.
Neither the statute nor the regulations requires a hospital to operate an emergency medical transport service. To
this extent, the hospital may meet its obligations as it sees fit; however, that does not mean HHS must accept the hospital's
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also note that with regard to the general area of transportation, although no specific comments were received concerning
``transportation equipment'', the term has now been interpreted to include all physical objects reasonably medically
necessary for safe patient transfer.

934 F.2d 1362, 1373 (5th Cir. 1991). We agree with this interpretation. To limit the appropriate transfer requirement
to just that equipment that is necessary and medically appropriate for life support measures is too narrow an interpretation.

Five commenters wrote in response to our request for comments concerning the ``other requirements'' the Secretary
may find necessary in the best interests of transferred patients' health and safety. They recommended that we require
the use of a standardized memorandum of transfer to be sent with every transferred patient to be signed by both transferring
and receiving physicians and to include information regarding the patient's medical condition, treatment received
and reasons for transfer. One of the commenters also recommended that calls between hospitals requesting transfers
be tape recorded.

Another commenter suggested that the certification requirement in proposed &sect;489.24(d)(1)(i)(B) (now &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(B))
be made a part of a standard transfer form. The commenters believed these suggestions would educate hospital personnel,
provide a record for enforcement of the statute, help assure that the receiving physicians receive appropriate medical
information for each patient, and deter patient dumping.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the requirements for requests for transfer, certification, and the sending of medical records are
sufficient to provide the information necessary for the receiving hospital to treat the individual and to detect
inappropriate transfers in order to fulfill its reporting requirement. While a memorandum of transfer might provide
a useful summary, we do not believe it is necessary in light of our other requirements. Also note the earlier Comment
and Response concerning another recommendation for the use of memoranda of transfer. Hospitals that frequently
receive inappropriate transfers may choose to document their transfers by tape recording telephone requests in
accordance with applicable State laws; however, we believe it both costly and impractical to require all hospitals
to invest in technology to document transfer circumstances verbatim in this way. In addition, since these additional
requirements would need to be adopted through the rulemaking process and the Secretary has not elected to establish
further requirements in this regulation, we are not including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this final rule the language in proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iv) concerning other requirements to avoid the implication
that there may be additional requirements not included in this regulation.

One commenter raised the issue of whether all transfers must be appropriately made (that is, effectuated) or whether
the rules governing appropriateness applied only to a physician-directed transfer.

All transfers must be effectuated appropriately and the statute and regulations already make this point. It is true
that an individual may demand a transfer that the physician does not believe is appropriate, but once the decision
to transfer has been made_by the physician or the individual_the regulations and the law require that it be done appropriately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also with regard to appropriate transfers, we note that the Secretary has taken the position that in proving that a
hospital or physician violated section 1867 of the Act, there is no requirement to prove that the transfer was effected
due to some ``impermissible motive.'' This position has been upheld in

We decline the invitation to attempt to define in advance all circumstances making the transfer of an unstabilized
individual ``appropriate.'' There will be many medical emergencies arising in a variety of settings. The proper
handling of those emergencies will depend upon the resources available and the exercise of medical judgment focused
on the best interest of the individual's health and safety. We find the broad guidelines offered by Congress in section
1867(c)(2)(C) of the Act sufficiently specific to guide the exercise of that discretion and our evaluation of cases
in which dumping is alleged. For the present we do not believe that any additional elaboration is required or desirable.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the regulations prevent any transfers, including those of stable patients, unless
that patient requires services or facilities not available at the hospital when the patient first arrived. Another
commenter wanted ``stable'' patients to be subject to the same ``appropriate transfer'' criteria as patients in
unstable condition because the regulatory definition of ``stabilized'' does not require the emergency medical
condition to be alleviated; it only requires that no material deterioration be likely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To accept these comments would go beyond the scope of the statute, which does not regulate the transfer of stabilized
individuals. The statute allows hospitals to transfer an individual, without meeting the requirements of an appropriate
transfer, after his or her emergency medical condition is stabilized. The statute does require, however, that the
transferring hospital provide whatever medical treatment it can, within its capacity, to minimize the risks to the
individual with an unstabilized medical condition, and, in the case of a woman in labor, to the unborn child.

One commenter wanted the regulations to define the situations in which obstetrical transfers are appropriate because
in the commenter's State, hospitals that do not offer obstetrical services must always transfer pregnant patients
in active labor, especially high risk patients.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not necessary to revise the regulations to be this specific. Regardless of practices within the State, COBRA
and OBRA 89 permit a woman in labor or with an unstabilized emergency medical condition to be transferred only if she
(or someone acting on her behalf) requests the transfer or if a physician signs a certification that the benefits outweigh
the risks. If the hospital does not provide obstetrical services, the benefits may outweigh the risks of transfer
or the woman or her representative may request a transfer. However, we cannot say categorically and in all cases that
this will be true. (Note also Response to next Comment.) Regardless of State law or practice, a hospital must fulfill
the requirements of the statute and cannot simply cite State law or practice as the basis for a transfer under the statute.
We note that OBRA 89 removed the term ``active labor'' from section 1867 of the Act and included the full range of symptoms
that term was intended to include within the scope of the term ``emergency medical condition,'' which it redefined.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an individual is to be transferred, section 1867(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act requires that the hospital obtain agreement
from the receiving hospital before a transfer is made. The changes made to title XVIII of the Act by COBRA did not require
hospitals to accept all transfers, even when the transfer would be in the individual's best interest. However, under
the nondiscrimination provision of section 1867(g) of the Act, as added by section 6211(f) of OBRA 89, hospitals with
specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock-trauma
units, neonatal intensive care units, or (with respect to rural areas) regional referral centers as defined in &sect;412.96),
cannot refuse to accept an appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities
if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. Accordingly, we have added the nondiscrimination provision
to &sect;489.24 as new paragraph (e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether new &sect;489.24(e) applies, we will assess whether the individual required the recipient
hospital's specialized capabilities or facilities and if the hospital had the capacity to treat the individual.
The recipient hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities has an obligation under section 1867(g) of the
Act to accept a transfer if the individual has an unstabilized emergency medical condition and if the hospital has
the capacity to treat the individual. If a hospital desires to transfer an individual to another hospital and the individual
does not require any treatment beyond the capabilities or facilities available at the transferring hospital, the
intended receiving hospital may refuse to accept the transfer of the individual in accordance with section 1867(c)(2)(B)(ii)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this requirement is to prevent hospitals with emergency departments from automatically transferring
patients before screening simply because the hospital does not offer a particular service. For example, a hospital
with an obstetrical department is not required to accept a transfer of a woman in labor just because the transferring
hospital does not have an obstetrical department. If the woman in labor is having a normal, uncomplicated delivery,
and the first hospital has the capacity to handle a normal, uncomplicated delivery, despite the fact that it does not
have an obstetrical department, the first hospital is required under section 1867(b) of the Act to provide the necessary
stabilizing treatment, that is to deliver the baby and the placenta, or to effect an appropriate transfer to another
hospital willing to accept the patient. Similarly, for an individual with a simple, closed fractured arm, a hospital
with an orthopedic department and orthopedic physicians on call would not be required to accept a transfer of the individual
just because the transferring hospital does not have an orthopedic service. The first hospital is required under
section 1867(b) of the Act to provide the necessary stabilizing treatment or to effect an appropriate transfer to
another hospital willing to accept the patient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a transferring hospital does not have the specialized capabilities necessary to stabilize the patient's condition,
the intended receiving hospital with the specialized capabilities and facilities must accept the patient under
1867(g) of the Act if it has the capacity to treat the individual. The number of patients that may be occupying a specialized
unit, the number of staff on duty, or the amount of equipment on the hospital's premises do not in and of themselves reflect
the capacity of the hospital to care for additional patients. If a hospital generally has accommodated additional
patients by whatever means (for example, moving patients to other units, calling in additional staff, borrowing
equipment from other facilities) it has demonstrated the ability to provide services to patients in excess of its
occupancy limit. For example, a hospital may be able to care for one or more severe burn patients (a common example of
specialized service) without opening up a ``burn unit.'' In this example, if the hospital has the capacity, the hospital
would have a duty to accept an appropriate transfer of an individual requiring the hospital's capabilities, provided
the transferring hospital lacked the specialized services required to stabilize the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Situations may arise where a hospital in another country desires to transfer an individual to a United States hospital
because of the United States hospital's specialized capabilities or facilities. However, we note that the provisions
of section 1867 of the Act are applicable only when the transferring hospital is located within the boundaries of the
United States. Accordingly, Medicare participating hospitals are not obligated to accept transfers from hospitals
located outside of the boundaries of the United States. This does not change the requirement that a Medicare participating
hospital that offers emergency services, must provide, upon request and within its capabilities, an appropriate
medical screening examination, stabilizing treatment, and/or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility
to any individual with an emergency medical condition, even if the individual is not a United States citizen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning community plans, the use of cooperative agreements to facilitate appropriate transfers would be a positive
step, and we recognize that a suggestion for using the JCAHO approach is constructive; however, we do not believe that
this regulation is an appropriate vehicle to mandate community-based plans for the delivery of emergency services.

 We do not believe it is necessary to add any further specificity to this requirement because, as indicated above, it
is understood that the records will have to verify that the receiving hospital has indicated to the transferring hospital
that it has agreed to treat the individual, which implies that it had the available space and qualified personnel to
treat that individual.

We do not believe it is appropriate to make this an explicit requirement of the regulations. The statute makes clear
that the transferring hospital is responsible for ensuring that when the individual is transferred, the transfer
is ``appropriate.'' The hospital, in ensuring that the individual is appropriately transferred, may, for example,
delegate to the transferring physician the duty to ensure that the transfer is made through the use of appropriate
personnel or equipment. Further, section 1867 of the Act and the regulations require that the hospital must provide
medical care within its capabilities to minimize the risks associated with transfer; this too may be delegated to
a physician. In this way, the physician may be responsible for the patient's care during the transfer.

Four commenters believe that the requirement that hospitals report suspected violations of section 1867 of the Act
within 72 hours of their occurrence is too rigid and should be changed to ``with reasonable promptness'' to deter excessive
reporting and to allow for investigation by the hospital to assure that reporting is warranted.

If transfers occur that needlessly jeopardize people's lives, HCFA must have that information immediately to meet
its responsibility to assure that these inappropriate transfers cease quickly. Therefore, we have made no changes.

One commenter recommended that the 72-hour reporting requirement for receiving hospitals suspecting improper
transfers should begin from the time a problem is first identified rather than from the date of the transfer.

The time of the receipt of an improperly transferred patient is the time of the occurrence. We do not see any substantive
time difference between the time of receipt and the time of identification that a patient had been improperly transferred.
However, to make reporting less onerous, we are revising &sect;489.20(m) and &sect;489.53(a)(10) to require a hospital
to report to either HCFA or the State agency, rather than both as proposed.

One commenter suggested that the regulation be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to permit HCFA to terminate a receiving hospital only for a ``knowing'' failure to report suspected violations.

We see no reason to require that HCFA prove that a hospital ``knowingly'' violated its obligation to report instances
of suspected dumping before it may take action against a non-complying hospital. As with other conditions of participation
imposed on providers for the protection of the health and safety of those benefitted by title XVIII, including those
protected by section 1867 of the Act, whether a hospital fails to meet its obligations knowingly is of little concern
to those the requirement is designed to benefit. We believe this is especially true since section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA
90 deleted the provision under which HCFA had to show first that the hospital's actions were either knowing and willful
or negligent before terminating the hospital's provider agreement. We do not believe the enhanced enforcement and,
hence, deterrence, behind requiring receiving hospitals to report instances of suspected dumping, would be advanced
by adding any requirement that the violation be knowing before a hospital's failure to report could result in its termination.
We expect hospitals to have and enforce policies and procedures to require its employees and staff physicians to report
to the administration instances where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual has been inappropriately transferred under this statute.

We do not have the authority to confer immunity on a provider that identifies an alleged improper transfer under these
regulations. However, HCFA has a history of protecting the identity and confidentiality of entities who report program
violations and this protection will be extended to hospitals and individuals reporting improper transfers. Additionally,
we also note that section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90 amended section 1867(i) of the Act (Whistleblower Protections), which
was enacted under OBRA 89, to prevent a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against any hospital employee
because the employee reported a violation of this requirement. We have revised &sect;489.24(d)(3) of the regulations
to reflect this statutory amendment.

Eight commenters claimed that the statute does not support the obligation to report suspected dumping or provide
for the termination of a provider that does not report suspected violations. Five commenters suggested that we extend
the responsibility to report suspected dumping violations to all Medicare providers and suppliers; ambulance service
suppliers, in particular, are in a position to suspect violations if the hospital to which the ambulance is transporting
the patient refuses to accept that patient. Several commenters recommended that the reporting requirements be extended
to physicians and that a failure to comply with these requirements would subject the physician to a civil monetary
penalty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe our requirements relating to reporting instances of dumping are supported by current law. Section 1861(e)(9)
of the Act permits the Secretary to impose on hospitals such other requirements as he finds necessary in the interest
of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution. It is under this authority that
the Secretary has obligated hospitals that participate in Medicare to report when they receive patients that have
been inappropriately transferred. Under section 1866(b)(2) (A) and (B) of the Act, the Secretary may terminate the
provider agreement of a hospital that is not complying substantially with the statute and regulations under title
XVIII or that no longer substantially meets the provisions of section 1861 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the anti-dumping provisions to all Medicare providers and suppliers should occur through a statutory
amendment. Section 1867 of the Act imposes duties directly only on hospitals that provide emergency services to which
individuals come for screening or treatment. No similar statutory authority generally exists to regulate the conduct
of non-providers, suppliers and practitioners.

We disagree. We are looking to those institutions in the best position to discern when an inappropriate transfer has
taken place in violation of the statute, because Congress regards them also as victims of ``dumping''. (See section
1867(d)(2)(B) of the Act.) This reporting requirement is not, however, an impediment to negotiation among hospitals
for the care of emergency patients. Indeed, it should encourage hospitals to cooperate in planning for appropriate
emergency care by eliminating inappropriate transfers.

We agree that ``suspected'' is a vague term. As a result we are revising proposed &sect;489.53(a)(10) to require a
hospital to report violations when a hospital has reason to believe that a violation has occurred. However, we see
no need to define which individuals in a hospital must hold the suspicion since we do not want to narrow the source of
reports.

are also written decisions and directives interpreting this issue and that using the OCR definition would relieve
Hill-Burton facilities of the risk of being required to comply with inconsistent treatment standards for women in
active labor.

We have not adopted the commenters' suggestion, because section 6211(h)(1)(B) of OBRA 89 deletes the definition
of ``active labor'' in section 1867(e)(2) of the Act. However, the concepts contained in that definition have now
been clarified and included in the definition of ``emergency medical condition'' defined in section 1867(e)(1)
of the Act.

One commenter asked us to make it clear that even though it may be difficult to state whether delivery is imminent, a
woman would be in ``active labor'' as that term is defined in section 1867(e)(2) of the Act (as added by COBRA), if there
was either inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital before delivery or if a transfer might pose
a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree. The proposed regulation restated the statutory definition, and, hence, reiterated that the transfer of
a woman in labor is subject to the provisions of section 1867 of the Act if any of the following three conditions pertain:
(a) delivery is imminent; (b) there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital prior to delivery;
or (c) a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. Section 6211(h)(2) of OBRA
89 amended section 1867(e) of the Act by deleting both the term ``active labor'' and the part of the definition that
covers women in labor where delivery is imminent. The definition of ``emergency medical condition'', however, was
expanded to include a woman who is having contractions when there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another
hospital before delivery or a woman who is having contractions where the transfer may impose a threat to the health
or safety of the woman or the unborn child. The OBRA 89 amendments clarified the scope of the statutory protections.
We have amended &sect;489.24(b) accordingly. In addition, the statute also refers to women in labor. We have defined
the term ``labor'' in &sect;489.24(b).

We believe that the ACEP definition is not suitable for purposes of requirements under section 1867 of the Act because
it is designed to assure that cases in which the patient believes that an emergency medical condition exists are, in
fact, emergencies. We believe that section 1867 of the Act only applies to actual emergencies as determined by appropriate
medical screening. Therefore, we have not adopted this recommendation.

We do not agree to delete the phrase ``placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy.'' The definition parallels
the statute and as such reflects Congressional intent. All of the phrases contained in the definition of emergency
medical condition describe outcomes that are likely to result from the denial of immediate attention upon the exercise
of medical judgment to predict what would happen to the individual if appropriate medical attention was not provided
immediately.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine commenters stated that the definitions of ``stabilized'' or ``stabilization'' are too vague or ambiguous to
be useful in determining whether a patient was appropriately transferred. Some commenters suggested alternative
definitions while others suggested we prohibit transfers not based solely on explicit medical reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory and regulatory definitions of ``to stabilize'' and ``stabilized'' are necessarily broad to apply
to all types of emergency medical conditions. The basic precept of these definitions is to ensure that no material
deterioration occurs to a patient's condition either as a result of the transfer or because the patient is outside
a hospital, and thus without the facilities and services available in a hospital. We do believe, however, that at least
one clarifying revision should be incorporated into the regulations to ensure that a patient with an emergency medical
condition will not be transferred unless, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of
the condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer. This revision is also consistent with section
6211(h)(1)(C)(ii) of OBRA 89. The regulations are being revised accordingly. The regulations do prohibit hospital-initiated
transfers that are not based solely on explicit medical reasons. This does not imply, however, in proving that a hospital
or physician violated section 1867 of the Act, that the Secretary must prove the transfer was effected due to an impermissible
or nonmedical motive. (See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot specify the length of time that it will take to stabilize a specific condition, as a specific time period would
rarely be applicable in all cases. The statutory definition, as applied, prevents a hospital from transferring an
individual who is going through alcohol detoxification if that condition constitutes an emergency medical condition,
until that individual can make the transfer without a material deterioration of the condition occurring during,
or resulting from, the transfer. Therefore, we are not adopting this suggestion.

It is impossible to define in advance all of the circumstances in which an individual may come to a hospital emergency
department. What will constitute an appropriate medical screening examination will vary according to the condition
of the individual and the capabilities of the hospital's emergency department_both its facilities and available
personnel, including on-call physicians. Within those capabilities, the examination must be sufficient to detect
whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition or is in labor because the law only requires hospitals
to provide screening and stabilizing treatment within their existing capabilities. Our current condition of participation
for emergency departments contains basic requirements, the specificity of which were subject to public comment
in connection with the revision of the hospital conditions of participation.

Congress did not specify a fixed monetary penalty for every violation. Instead, it provided for hospitals and responsible
physicians to be subject to a civil monetary penalty ``of not more than'' $25,000 for violations occurring before
December 22, 1987 and ``of not more than'' $50,000 for violations occurring on or after that date. The civil monetary
penalty section was amended in OBRA 90 to provide a maximum penalty of $25,000 for hospitals with fewer than 100 state-licensed,
Medicare-certified beds. By setting a maximum amount, Congress implied that the Secretary was to exercise her discretion
in selecting an appropriate amount up to that maximum.

The OIG will not consider the lack of a prior history of offenses to be a mitigating circumstance, but it may consider
a history of inappropriate transfers to be a factor that would warrant imposition of a penalty at or near the statutory
maximum. Only if a hospital or physician could offer positive evidence of a history of statutory compliance (for example,
by producing logs of its disposition of individuals who had come to the emergency department) would the OIG be inclined
to regard the violation as an isolated aberration.

We disagree. To deter future violations of the statute, Congress intended that violations be sanctioned regardless
of whether a violating hospital took remedial action. Such remedial action may prevent the hospital from suffering
the consequences of a termination of its provider agreement and the resulting loss of Medicare payment, but it does
not shield it from liability for civil monetary penalties if the violations were negligent. Congress enacted section
1867 of the Act because it perceived that hospitals were not policing themselves sufficiently to prevent inappropriate
transfers.

only allows a penalty of up to $25,000.

Section 4009(a)(1) of OBRA 87 amended section 1867(d) of the Act to increase the maximum civil monetary penalty from
$25,000 to $50,000, effective December 22, 1987. Any violation occurring after December 22, 1987 is therefore subject
to a maximum fine of up to $50,000 while violations occurring prior to December 22, 1987 are only subject to a maximum
fine of up to $25,000. We are amending 42 CFR 1003.103 accordingly. However, section 4008(b)(2) of OBRA 90 again amended
the statute by reducing the maximum penalty against hospitals with fewer than 100 state-licensed, Medicare-certified
beds of $25,000.

One commenter stated that civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 constituted a criminal sanction that will place
physicians in the position of balancing responsible medical judgment against the fear of fines for an unanticipated
event that may occur during transfer; this will have negative effect on emergency care.

The maximum amount of the penalty is determined by the statute and cannot be changed in these regulations. The statute
expressly provides for a civil monetary penalty of not more than $50,000 if a hospital or physician who is responsible
for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual in a participating hospital violates a provision of section
1867 of the Act. This penalty is civil in nature and does not constitute a criminal sanction.

Three commenters expressed concerns about the statutory provision that states that section 1867 of the Act does not
preempt State or local law except where they conflict. One of these commenters thought that Federal law should not
supersede State and local law except where the State is not fulfilling its obligation under the law; another commenter
believed we should grant immunity to hospitals following Federal statute in conflict with State law. The third commenter
said this provision would result in more State regulation where States have similar laws.

Section 1867(f) of the Act explicitly states that the provisions of section 1867 do not preempt any State or local law
requirement except in cases of a direct conflict. This statutory statement cannot be removed based on negative public
comment. We believe, however, that the second commenter misunderstood the provision: when Federal law conflicts
with State law, Federal law prevails.

One commenter expressed concern that a provider may be subject to double jeopardy if HCFA is allowed to terminate the
provider agreement for violating section 1867 of the Act and then, for the same violation, the OIG is authorized to
suspend the provider. Several commenters expressed concern that a provider is subject to double jeopardy since,
for an alleged single inappropriate transfer, OIG may suspend a provider and subject the provider to civil monetary
penalties even if HCFA determines there is no violation.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A provider agreement can no longer be suspended for a violation of section 1867 of the Act since, as we previously indicated,
section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted the suspension provisions contained in the original legislation. If, however,
HCFA begins a termination action based on a violation of the statute, but the hospital avoids termination by demonstrating
to HCFA's satisfaction that it has in place effective policies and procedures to prevent a recurrence, the OIG remains
free to seek civil monetary penalties against the hospital and physician for the violation of the statute on which
the termination action was originally based.

One commenter stated that, in order to avoid duplication of effort, the regulations should limit OIG investigation
to those cases where it finds a pattern of noncompliance, with willful violation of the provisions, or where there
is some indication of fraud or abuse against the Medicare program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law does not require a pattern of violations or willful noncompliance for the Department to invoke sanctions.
The OIG may impose a civil monetary penalty for a single violation of the statute. The statute was amended in OBRA 90,
however, to allow the OIG to exclude physicians from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs
only if the violation is ``gross and flagrant or repeated.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``gross and flagrant'' is also used in section 1156 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320c&hyph;5, and has been defined
in regulations at 42 CFR 1004.1(b). This definition has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and the
courts have disagreed, upholding the Department's interpretation of the term. See, for example,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Violations of section 1867 of the Act have the potential to be immediate and serious threats to patient health and safety.
Therefore, we believe that it is essential that a violation that poses an immediate and serious threat be corrected
as rapidly as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where it has been determined that the violation poses an immediate and serious threat to patient health and
safety, a hospital will be placed on a 23-day termination track. On day 1, the hospital will receive a preliminary notice
of termination from the regional office stating that a violation has been identified and that the projected date of
termination will be on day 23. The preliminary notice of termination will also inform the hospital that the HCFA regional
office will issue a final notice of termination and inform the public of the date of termination at least 2 days, but
not more than 4 days, before the projected date of termination. Thus, the final notice to the hospital and the public
concerning the termination of the hospital's provider agreement for a violation that poses an immediate and serious
threat to patient health and safety will be issued between day 19 and day 21 of the 23-day termination track.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preliminary notice of termination will also inform the hospital that it may avoid the termination action by either
providing credible evidence of correction of the deficiencies or by successfully showing that the deficiencies
did not exist. The hospital will have an opportunity to make such a showing to the regional office between day 1 and day
19 of the termination process. If the hospital is successful, the regional office will stop the termination process,
and there will not be a public notice of termination. If verification of correction does not occur before the 19th day
of the termination track, the hospital receives a final notice of termination, and the public is concurrently notified
by publication of the effective date of the termination in the newspaper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases that do not involve an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, a hospital will be placed
on a 90-day termination track. The hospital will receive a preliminary notice of termination on day 1, and will be notified
that the projected termination date will be on day 90. We will continue our current practice, set forth in &sect;489.53(c)(1),
of issuing a final notice of termination to the hospital and the public 15 days prior to the effective date of termination.
Thus, in situations where the violation does not constitute an immediate and serious threat to patient health and
safety, public notice of the effective date of the termination will be given on approximately day 75 of the 90-day termination
process unless the hospital successfully shows that correction has occurred.

With regard to possible civil monetary penalties or physician exclusion, OBRA 90 responds to the commenter's suggestion.
Under section 1154(a)(16) of the Act, as added by section 4027(a)(1)(B) of OBRA 90, PRO must provide reasonable notice
of the review to the physician and hospital involved and a reasonable opportunity for discussion and submission of
additional information prior to providing their report to HCFA. Thus, we believe that the commenter's concerns are
mitigated by this new statutory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to termination, HCFA regional office staff may meet with the hospital's representatives before determining
compliance or noncompliance if they decide they need additional information to make a compliance determination.
If, after reviewing the State agency finding and medical review findings (if requested), the regional office staff
has sufficient information to make a determination, they may decide not to meet informally with the hospital's representatives.
Options for resolving the deficiencies do not affect the compliance determination.

One commenter stated that mandatory termination is not consistent with the statute. Seven commenters recommended
that the regulations not state that any violation will result in termination; termination should be imposed only
for particularly egregious violations or a pattern of repeated violations. Several commenters questioned the basis
for considering a violation to pose an immediate and serious threat, especially when there is only one violation.
Five of these commenters thought single violations should be sanctioned with civil monetary penalties.

Section 1866(b)(2) of the Act permits HCFA to terminate but does not require HCFA to do so. There are cases in which a
violation has occurred but in which HCFA has not chosen to terminate. For example, if a routine recertification survey
shows that a hospital's internal quality assurance identified a violation that occurred 6 months ago, and since then
the hospital has been functioning effectively under a corrective action plan, and the hospital is in compliance with
all other conditions of participation, HCFA may determine that although the hospital did violate the statute 6 months
earlier, a termination is not warranted at the time of the survey.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute does not limit termination action to hospitals that have a pattern of violations. A single violation may
result in the initiation of termination procedures. However, HCFA is more interested in hospitals correcting their
deficiencies and remaining available to serve patients than in terminating them from Medicare participation. As
a result, HCFA regional office staff have generally exercised their authority to permit correction before the effective
date of termination as justification for rescinding the termination. On the other hand, hospitals that do not correct
the deficiencies that permitted a violation to occur may represent an immediate and serious threat to people seeking
emergency care. In such a case, HCFA will move quickly to either assure that the deficiencies that led to the violation
are corrected or to terminate the hospital's provider agreement. It should be noted that section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA
90 deleted the termination and suspension language from section 1867(d) of the Act. Terminations due to violations
of section 1867 of the Act are now subject to the regular provider agreement rules in section 1866 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the immediate and serious threat concept applies to a provider's potential for causing harm as a result
of lax policies and procedures as well as the danger posed by patently unsafe physical conditions or staffing shortages.
Thus, we believe that operating in a manner that potentially subjects individuals to the threat of summary transfer
without treatment may pose an immediate and serious threat to individuals who present themselves to the hospital
for treatment. As noted above, if the provider is able to demonstrate that this is not the case, the termination is withdrawn
and the provider's participation in the program is uninterrupted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, while a single violation may very well be sanctioned with civil monetary penalties, nothing in the statutory
scheme suggests that the authority to terminate a hospital's provider agreement should be limited by the number of
violations.

The factors to be considered in determining the amount of civil monetary penalty that are set forth in &sect;1003.106(a)(4)
are adapted from those mandated by section 1128A(d) of the Act. Section 1867(d)(1) of the Act requires that the provisions
of section 1128A of the Act other than subsection (a) and subsection (b) apply to the imposition of a civil monetary
penalty against a participating hospital and physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As thus incorporated by reference, section 1128A(d) of the Act requires that the OIG consider the nature of claims
and circumstances under which they were presented, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, and financial
condition of the person presenting the claims, and such other matters as justice may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are revising proposed &sect;1003.106(a)(4) to reflect the essence of these statutory considerations as modified
to fit violations of section 1867 of the Act. Section 1003.106(a)(4) also now includes among the factors ``financial
condition'' and ``nature and circumstances of the violation.'' These were omitted from the notice of proposed rulemaking
but are required under section 1128A(d) of the Act.

One commenter stated that, before termination, HCFA should consider all circumstances of the case including such

on the community.

Congress has provided that any hospital that has failed to comply with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act is
subject to termination of its provider agreement. It did not provide, or suggest in legislative history, that the
Secretary should create a system of lesser measures to account for the factors mentioned by the commenter. Rather,
it intended the gravity of the sanction to cause hospitals to comply with their obligations. When a hospital does violate
its duties under section 1867 of the Act, we must take immediate action to prevent that hospital from jeopardizing
the health and safety of the next person who may seek help in an emergency situation. Vigorous enforcement of these
provisions is essential to remedy the problem that prompted Congress to legislate against the denial of screening
and/or treatment and the inappropriate transfer of individuals with emergency medical conditions. A hospital will
not suffer the loss of Medicare funding if it can demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that it has taken the steps necessary
to ensure that the mandates of the statute are observed by its employees, contractors, and staff. If a hospital demonstrates
its unwillingness or inability to meet that commitment within the time provided, it will be terminated. When a hospital
has had a history of violations, the situation may make the regional office skeptical about the hospital's willingness
and ability to enforce its own policies to guarantee that emergency services are available to all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that the termination of a hospital's provider agreement would have a serious impact on the community.
This is the remedy the law provides. We believe that this remedy provides the hospital (and its community) with the
incentive to assure compliance.

 In view of the nature of the problems that this provision addresses, it is not appropriate to take a general approach
that permits a provided to avoid immediate inspection in all cases. The HCFA regional office will determine whether
there is an advantage to conducting an unscheduled survey. We note, however, that when continued monitoring is appropriate
to assure that corrective action has been taken, we will inform the provider of the period for which monitoring will
continue.

 As we previously indicated, section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, which provided for
termination or suspension of a hospital's Medicare provider agreement for ``knowingly and willfully, or negligently''
failing to meet these statutory requirements. However, section 1866(a)(1)(I)(i) of the Act was also amended to require
hospitals to meet the provisions of section 1867 in order to participate in the Medicare program. We have, therefore,
revised &sect;489.24(f) of this regulation to delete the requirement that a hospital must knowingly and willfully,
or negligently, fail to meet the regulation's requirements to be subject to termination. It should also be noted that
because of the deletion of section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, hospitals are no longer subject to suspension of their provider
agreement based upon violation of these provisions. By requiring that all hospitals comply with the provisions of
section 1867 of the Act, Congress indicated that section 1867 violations by hospitals could result in termination
of a hospital's Medicare provider agreement and civil monetary penalties. In addition, as discussed below, civil
monetary penalties may now be imposed for a negligent, rather than a knowing, violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of the statute does not permit us to adopt the commenter's suggestion. ``Knowingly'' is a legal term with
a well-developed history. The accepted meaning of the term does not include ``should have known.'' Indeed, the latter
term denotes a lack of knowledge and is used in those contexts where a person is held liable for not knowing what he or
she would have known had he or she exercised due care. A person need not know the terms of the statute in order to commit
a knowing violation of the statute. A knowing violation of the statute requires only that the person do a proscribed
act, knowing the character of the proscribed act. In this context, for example, a physician would knowingly violate
the statute if he or she certified that the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that had not
been stabilized was in the best interests of the patient if the physician knew that the patient had an emergency condition
that had not been stabilized and that the risks of transfer outweighed the benefits the physician could reasonably
expect by the delivery of appropriate care in the receiving hospital. The physician would not need to know that section
1867 of the Act prohibited such transfer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the term ``knowingly'' does not encompass ``should have known,'' it does embrace the concepts of ``reckless
disregard'' and ``deliberate ignorance.'' That is, it includes a form of constructive knowledge in which an individual
is deemed to have actual knowledge of the facts and circumstances about which he or she would have had knowledge if the
individual had not deliberately or recklessly disregarded facts that were readily available. We are amending &sect;1003.102(c)
to make it clear that the term ``knowingly'' encompasses these two concepts.

Hospitals in violation of the statute are subject to termination and civil monetary penalties. Thus, any substantiated
violation may result in termination. Once these regulations are published, specific guidelines for assessing whether
a case represents a violation will be included in the State Operations and Regional Office Medicare Certification
Manuals. While the manuals in no way purport to be exhaustive in their description of potential section 1867 violations,
they do provide a sense as to how HCFA intends to interpret this provision. The manuals are sent to HCFA's regional offices
and each State agency. They are also available on a subscription basis from the Department of Commerce's National
Technical Information Service, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161. These manuals are continually
updated to reflect new regulations.

This is an issue that has been litigated extensively in the past. The courts have widely held that due process for providers
of health services under the Medicare program does not require a formal hearing before adverse action is taken. Our
regulations at &sect;498.5(b) have long provided for a post-termination hearing before an administrative law judge
for providers that have been terminated. Also, in accordance with &sect;498.5(c), any provider dissatisfied with
a hearing decision may request Appeals Council review and has a right to seek judicial review of the Council's decision.

The statute at section 1866(c)(1) of the Act provides that a hospital that has been terminated from the Medicare program
may not file another agreement unless the Secretary finds that the reason for the termination has been removed and
that there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur. Thus, terminated hospitals may reapply for Medicare certification
whenever they have corrected the deficiencies that caused the termination. We reserve the right to determine an appropriate
reasonable assurance period before reinstatement on a case-by-case basis.

Section 1867(d)(3) of the Act, as added by section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90, sets forth the role of PROs in patient dumping
cases. Specifically, for sanctions imposed on or after February 1, 1991, section 1867(d)(3) of the Act requires the
appropriate PRO to review the case prior to the imposition of a civil monetary penalty or physician exclusion sanction,
except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals or when an individual is denied a screening
examination. Given this statutory direction, we do not believe it would be appropriate to place additional requirements

One commenter recommended that HCFA require hospitals to maintain a record of the disposition of all individiuals
seeking emergency care. If the individual were transferred, such a log would bear the initials of the physician authorizing
the transfer and identify the reasons for the transfer, the receiving hospital, and the person accepting transfer
for that hospital. Such records would educate hospital personnel about the statutory requirements, deter violations,
and provide an audit trail to assist HHS in performing its monitoring and enforcement duties.

Another commenter suggested that we require each hospital to maintain a record of all patients it transfers and of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that the hospital must maintain a central log or record of how it handles every individual that comes to its
emergency department for HHS and its agents to monitor compliance with the statute. The OIG has reported that a lack
of a central record on the disposition of persons seeking emergency services hampers HHS' ability to monitor compliance
(Office of Inspector General, ``Patient Dumping After COBRA: Assessing the Incidences and the Perspectives of Health
Care Professionals'' (August 1988)). Hence, we are amending the regulations at &sect;489.20(r)(3) to require a
hospital to maintain a central log of all individuals who come to its emergency room seeking assistance and the disposition
of such individuals, whether they were or are refused treatment, transferred, admitted and treated, stabilized
and transferred, or discharged. Such a record will permit HHS and the State survey and certification agencies to select
and gain access to individual medical records for further inquiry. However, we are not prescribing a standard form
at this time. Our condition of participation for medical record services, at &sect;482.24(b), requires hospitals
to maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient. Additionally, our enforcement procedures include
a review of a simple of patient records. The sampling technique takes into account emergency room triage and unreimbursed
care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 80 percent of the 6600 hospitals participating in the Medicare program are accredited by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). JCAHO-accredited hospitals are required to
maintain a control register and initiate a medical record every time an individual visits the emergency service (Standard
ES.6). The JCAHO-mandated control register must contain at least the names of all persons (including the names of
individuals dead on arrival) seeking care, as well as their age and sex; date, time, and means of arrival; nature of
the complaint; disposition; and time of departure. The regulation at &sect;489.20(r)(3) merely requires the name
of the individual and the disposition of his or her case. We believe maintaining a register of individuals seeking
care is an industry standard and will not impose an additional burden on the 20 percent of hospitals that are not accredited.
We have found a control register or control log to be invaluable in identifying records to be reviewed during our complaint
investigations. We have not found any hospital that is not maintaining a log of some sort.

utilized by the PROs under section 1154(a)(6)(A) of the Act.

resorting to sanctions.

This regulation emphasizes correction over sanctions. Hospitals that have violated these requirements are permitted
the opportunity to correct the deficiencies and avoid termination. To date, 96 percent of violating hospitals have
been able to avoid termination by correcting the deficiencies that led to the violations. However, the Department's
primary responsibility is toward people who need health care, and in cases in which a hospital either cannot or does
not correct its deficiencies, we believe it is appropriate to terminate the hospital from the Medicare program quickly.
In addition, the law includes authority to exclude physicians and impose civil monetary penalties against hospitals
and physicians. This serves as both a remedial function and a deterrent function. This may also motivate corrections
and improvements to prevent future violations of the statute.

Three commenters indicated that hospitals should be involved in the investigation's fact finding process and should
be advised of all evidence before HCFA receives the deficiency report. In addition, they recommended the hospital
be permitted to submit documentation regarding the evidence and a response to the information submitted to HCFA,
so that HCFA will have all the information before taking action.

When the onsite investigation of a violation of section 1867 of the Act is completed, the hospital's representatives
have an opportunity to be informed of the scope of the survey agency's investigation and findings at an exit conference.
The survey agency, however, will inform the hospital that, unlike other surveys, an investigation of a violation
of section 1867 of the Act usually does not end with its onsite investigation; it may require medical review. The HCFA
regional office will make the final determination based on all of the relevant information, including the results
of medical review, if needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regional office makes a determination of noncompliance, it will notify the hospital via a preliminary determination
letter. The date the hospital receives the preliminary determination letter becomes the date for commencement of
the termination process, which lasts approximately 23 days in situations where it has been determined that the violation
resulted in an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, or approximately 90 days where the violation
was not considered to pose an immediate and serious threat. If the regional office receives additional information
that proves the hospital did not violate section 1867 of the Act, or regional office verification reveals that the
hospital has taken remedial action to prevent further violations before the actual date of termination, the termination
action will be rescinded. As noted in a previous response to a comment, if there was a violation of section 1867 of the
Act and the hospital does not take corrective action, a final termination letter will be sent to the hospital and the
public will be notified concurrently through a notice in the newspaper (at least 2 days, but no more than 4 days, before
the actual termination date in immediate and serious threat situations, or at least 15 days before the actual termination
date in situations that do not pose an immediate and serious threat). Therefore, the change in the notice requirement
in immediate and serious threat situations offers the provider approximately 19 days to correct the deficiencies
before termination becomes effective in immediate and serious threat cases and continues to offer the provider approximately
75 days to correct deficiencies before termination becomes effective for situations that do not pose an immediate
and serious threat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the onset, the hospital is aware of the problem, HCFA's intended course of action, and that it must take corrective
action or prove that the violation did not exist in order to halt the termination process. During and after this period,
the hospital may submit documentation regarding the violation if it chooses; however, the termination process continues
until proof is submitted to establish that a violation had not occurred, corrective action is verified, or the termination
date is reached. HCFA's primary responsibility is to the people who come to the hospital in emergency situations.
Their urgent need for proper medical care is a higher priority than providing for time-consuming historical re-review
before action is taken against a hospital with improper practices.

 One commenter disagreed with HCFA's intention to rely on State survey agencies to investigate initial complaints
of violation because in many States these agencies have an inherent conflict of interest. The commenter recommended
that, to guarantee that there are no conflicts of interest, HCFA should at least apply certain minimum performance
standards and investigatory guidelines in determining in which States the State survey agency can be entrusted with
the role of investigating complaints.

As provided for by section 1864(c) of the Act, HCFA contracts with the State survey agency to conduct surveys to evaluate
compliance with Federal health and safety requirements. We provide training, survey report forms and interpretive
guidelines and perform Federal surveys and oversight to monitor the States' performances. Consequently, we are
confident of the States' abilities to conduct compliant investigations.

allowed to penalize or take action against any hospital employee because the employee reported a violation of these

The statute imposes duties on a hospital, many of which can only be effectively carried out by physicians in some way
affiliated with the hospital. Neither the statute nor the regulations attempt to define the means by which the hospital
meets its statutory obligations to provide emergency screening examination, treatment or transfer.

Three commenters raised a question concerning the hospital's responsibility in a case in which a physician who is
not responsible for providing emergency care, but whose specialty is required to perform stabilizing care, refuses
to treat or examine a patient.

Although the term ``responsible physician'' is no longer used in the statute, the Department has maintained the term
in these regulations, defining it to be consistent with the present statute. Hence, the definition of a ``responsible
physician'' as drafted in these regulations includes any physician to whom the hospital has delegated responsibility
to examine, treat, or transfer an individual that comes to the hospital emergency department seeking help. A hospital
may use physicians on its medical staff to carry out its responsibilities under the statute. As indicated in the OBRA
89 amendments to section 1867, these physicians, including those who provide emergency services on-call as a condition
of enjoying staff privileges, may be held liable for violating the statute and regulations.

One commenter recommended that ``responsible physician'' be defined to prevent a physician from being held liable
for not providing treatment that is beyond his clinical area of competence or hospital privileges or for treatment
decisions that are made in the physician's absence when the physician is available only by telephone.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that the comment requires a change in the definition. The commenter is concerned that a physician
not be held responsible for aspects of an individual's care that are beyond his competence or hospital privileges.
Consistent with the statute, the regulations use the term ``responsible physician'' to denote a physician with the
responsibility to examine, treat, or transfer a patient. A hospital cannot require a physician to perform duties
that are either beyond the physician's competence or the scope of the physician's hospital privileges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, where a responsible physician makes treatment or transfer decisions by telephone, the physician
remains liable for such decisions.

We have amended the definition of ``responsible physician'' to comport with the OBRA 89 amendments to section 1867
of the Act. The definition encompasses any physician, including those physicians on-call, to whom the hospital has
delegated responsibility to examine, treat, or transfer an individual that comes to the hospital emergency department
seeking help. A hospital may use physicians on its medical staff to carry out its responsibilities under the statute.
OBRA 89 amended section 1866(a)(1)(I) of the Act to require the hospital, as a condition of participation, to ``maintain
a list of physicians who are on-call for duty after the initial examination to provide treatment necessary to stabilize
an individual with an emergency medical condition.''

As previously indicated, pursuant to OBRA 89, the hospital has a duty to ensure that, within the capabilities of the
hospital's staff and facility, the medical needs of an individual who comes to an emergency room can be met. The hospital's
capabilities include the skills of a specialist who has staff privileges to the extent that the hospital can require
the specialist to furnish these services. However, it is up to the hospital to determine how it will comply with its
statutory obligations.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be a responsible physician under the terms of the statute and regulations, a physician must be responsible for examining,
treating, or transferring an individual whom the statute protects. If an emergency room physician, for example,
is under contract with the hospital to provide emergency care and treatment, but does not have admitting privileges,
that physician is still under an obligation to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and either stabilizing
treatment within the capabilities of the staff and facilities of the hospital or an appropriate transfer under the
statute. Section 1867(d)(1)(C) of the Act specifically states that if a physician determines that an ``individual
requires the services of a physician listed by the hospital on its list of on-call physicians .&blank;.&blank;. and
notifies the on-call physician and the on-call physician fails or refuses to appear within a reasonable period of
time, and the physician orders the transfer of the individual because,'' without the on-call physician's services,
the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks of transfer, the transferring physician will not be subject to penalties
under section 1867 of the Act. However, this does not absolve the hospital and the on-call physician from liability
under the statute.

We do not agree with the commenter's contention. In reviewing allegations of patient dumping, we will look at all the
information available to the treating or transferring physician at the time the decision is made. We believe that
the physician's concern should be for the patient rather than for possible consequences of this requirement. To further
strengthen the protection of emergency room physicians with regard to their transfer decisions, section 6211(f)
of OBRA 89 added paragraph (i) to section 1867 of the Act to prevent hospitals from penalizing physicians who refuse
to authorize the transfer of an individual with an unstabilized emergency medical condition. In addition, section
4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90 amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1867(i) of the Act to provide similar protection to qualified medical emergency room staff with regard to
their transfer decisions when a physician is not available in the emergency room. We are amending &sect;489.24(d)(3)
to include these new provisions so that it conforms to the statute as amended.

A patient's obligations to pay for services provided by a hospital is beyond the scope of these regulations. However,

the statute and regulations with respect to that individual. Section 1867(h) of the Act, as added by section 6211(f)
of OBRA 89, states expressly that the ``hospital may not delay provision of an appropriate medical screening examination

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above in section II.D. of this preamble, Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency
Cases, and in several responses to comments, before imposing civil monetary penalties and exclusions, section 1867(d)(3)
of the Act requires that we request the appropriate PRO to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency
medical condition that had not been stabilized and report on its findings before the OIG may impose a civil monetary
penalty or exclusion. [Note: PRO review is not required in cases where a delay in effecting a sanction would jeopardize
the health or safety of individuals or in situations where medical review is inappropriate, for example, in cases
where an individual was denied a medical screening examination.] The Secretary must provide the PRO with at least
60 days for the review. The PRO is required to provide reasonable notice of the review to the hospital and physician
involved. The PRO is also required to provide them with a reasonable opportunity for discussion and an opportunity
to submit additional information. This provision is effective for sanctions imposed on or after February 1, 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the possible termination phase of a case's development, the HCFA regional office has the responsibility and
authority to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance. Termination procedures provide for an opportunity
for the provider to comment. During this phase, the HCFA regional office is not required to instruct the PRO to offer
the affected hospital an opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information. Subsequent to this
phase, the OIG has the responsibility and authority to direct that the PRO conduct an assessment. In conducting such
as assessment, the PRO is required to offer the affected physician and/or hospital an opportunity for discussion
and submission of additional information before the PRO issues its report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are adding a new paragraph (g) to proposed &sect;489.24 to implement the statutory provision that PROs have at least
60 days to make their assessments and to specify that PROs must provide affected physicians and hospitals reasonable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of review and opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we are adding a new &sect;489.24(h) to clarify that, upon request, HCFA may release a PRO assessment to
the physician or hospital (or both where applicable), or the affected individual, or his or her representative. However,
we specify that the PRO physician's identity is confidential unless he or she consents to release his or her identity,
in accordance with the PRO disclosure regulations set forth at &sect;&sect;476.132 and 476.133. If the case goes
to litigation, the PRO is required to provide expert testimony and it is preferable, but not required, that the testifying
physician be the same physician who reviewed and reported on the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, the statutory change requiring PRO review applies only in situations involving civil monetary
penalties and exclusions. Termination proceedings pursuant to section 1866 of the Act as a result of violations of
the anti-dumping provisions of section 1866 and section 1867 do not require PRO review. We note that a facility could
be the subject of a termination proceeding and also be assessed civil monetary penalties.

rule, as amended by the revisions discussed below and clarifications discussed elsewhere in this preamble. (To accommodate
changes to the Code of Federal Regulations since the publication of the June 16, 1988 proposed rule, proposed paragraphs
(k) through (q) of &sect;489.20 have been redesignated as paragraphs (l) through (r).) Unless otherwise noted, revisions
are based on our evaluation of public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA and VA: We made no revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Hospital discharge rights notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have revised this section to eliminate the requirement that the beneficiary or his or her representative acknowledge
receipt of the ``Message'' by signing the acknowledgement statement on the ``Message.'' We have also eliminated
the requirement that an acknowledgement of the ``Message'' be retained by the hospital. Instead, we will rely on hospitals
to determine how they can best comply with the requirement that each beneficiary be provided with a discharge rights
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Hospital responsibility for emergency care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are revising the proposed regulations as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(m): We have clarified &sect;489.20(m) to eliminate any implication that a hospital may improperly
transfer a patient as long as it is done with prior arrangement. In addition, we are requiring that when a hospital has
reason to believe that an individual was transferred in violation of the requirements of &sect;489.24, it will report
the violation to either HCFA or the State survey agency, rather than to both, as required by the proposed regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 489.20(q): We are adding provisions based on section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, requiring hospitals to
post conspicuously in their emergency departments signs specifying rights of individuals under section 1867 of
the Act with respect to examination and treatment and to post 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conspicuously information indicating whether or not the hospital participates in the Medicaid program under a State
plan approved under title XIX. Some public commenters also wrote in support of the posting of signs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(r)(1): Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89 and in response to public comment, we are adding the requirement that both transferring and receiving
hospitals maintain medical and other records related to individuals transferred for a period of 5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(r)(2): Also pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are adding the requirement that a hospital maintain a list of physicians
who are on call for duty after the initial examination to provide treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(r)(3): We are requiring each hospital (both transferring and receiving) to keep a log of each
individual who came to the emergency department seeking assistance and whether he or she refused treatment or was
refused treatment, transferred, admitted and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(b): We are expanding the definition of ``emergency medical condition'' to include psychiatric
disturbances, symptoms of substance abuse, and situations with respect to pregnant women having contractions.
We add definitions of ``capacity'', ``comes to the emergency department'', ``hospital'', ``hospital with an emergency
department'', ``labor'', and ``participating hospital.'' We clarify other definitions to make them consistent
with other versions of the text. We have deleted the term ``active labor'' in accordance with section 6211(h)(1)(B)
of OBRA 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(c) (2) and (4) and (d) (1) and (2): We are adding provisions to require a written informed refusal
from the patient or individual acting on his or her behalf when the patient refuses treatment or transfer. We specify
that the medical record must contain a description of the examination and treatment, or transfer, or refusal. The
refusal must indicate that the patient (or person acting on his or her behalf) is aware of the risks and benefits of the
transfer, or the examination or treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(c)(3): We are adding the requirement that a hospital may not delay providing an appropriate
medical screening examination in order to inquire about payment method or insurance status. This is the result of
public comment and section 6211(h) of OBRA 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(d)(1)(ii)(A): Based on section 6211(c)(1) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are adding a requirement
that an individual (or legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) who wants to be transferred
must indicate in writing the reason for the request for transfer and that he or she is aware of its risks and benefits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(d)(3): Based on section 6211(i) of OBRA 89 and section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90, we are prohibiting
a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person who refuses
to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency condition that has not been stabilized or against any
hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(e): Based on section 6211(f) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 89 and public comment, we are requiring that a hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities accept transfer
of any individual requiring those specialized capabilities or facilities if it has the capacity to treat the individual.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(f): Because of section 4008(b)(3)(A) of OBRA 90, the standard for terminating a hospital has
changed. HCFA is no longer required to prove that the hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to
meet the requirements of this regulation. We may now terminate such hospitals for failing to meet these requirements
under section 1866 of the Act based upon section 4008(b)(3)(B) of OBRA 90, which requires hospitals to meet the requirements
of section 1867 of the Act in order to participate in the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(g): Based on section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90, we are requiring PRO review to assess whether the
individual involved had an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized, in addition to other medical
issues, before imposing a civil monetary penalty or exclusion, unless obtaining such review would cause delay that
would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or if there is no medical issue to review (that is, no screening
examination was conducted). In cases that do not present jeopardy, the PRO review and report to HCFA must be completed
in 60 calendar days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(h): We are clarifying in new &sect;489.24(h) that, upon request, HCFA may release a PRO assessment
to the physician or hospital, or the affected individual or his or her representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.53(a): We are revising the proposed rule to require a receiving hospital to report incidents it
has reason to believe may be violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.53(b): We are adding to the reasons for termination_(a) a refusal of a hospital with specialized
capabilities or facilities that has the capacity to accept an appropriate transfer; (b) failure to maintain an on-call
duty roster, medical records for 5 years, and a log of individuals seeking emergency assistance; and (c) failure to
post notices as required concerning participation in Medicaid and the rights of individuals under 42 CFR part 489,
subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.53(c)(2)(ii): We are specifying that a hospital found in violation of &sect;&sect;489.24(a)
through (h) will receive a final notice of termination and the public will be concurrently notified at least 2 but no
more than 4 days before the effective date of the termination. This allows a hospital approximately 19 to 21 days to
correct or refute alleged deficiencies. We also clarify that we will not terminate if the hospital has corrected or
refuted the deficiencies that gave rise to the termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are adding ``or rural primary care hospital'' wherever ``hospital'' appears in &sect;489.24, as required
by section 6003(g) of OBRA 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are also removing all references to suspension of the provider from the regulations at &sect;&sect;489.24
and 489.53, based on the deletion of the suspension authority by section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are making none of the proposed revisions to part 1001, which all concerned suspension of providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.100: We are revising the proposed section to conform with several rulemaking documents that
have been published since our proposed rule. The requirements contained in proposed &sect;1003.100(b)(1)(ii)
are now set forth in &sect;1003.100(b)(1)(vi).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 1003.101: We are adding or revising in this section the definitions for the terms ``participating
hospital'' (to comport with the statute), ``respondent'', and ``responsible physician''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.102: This section also has been revised by several rulemaking documents since the publication
of our June 16, 1988, proposed rule. In this interim final rule, we are clarifying in paragraph (c)(2) that the term
``knowingly'' encompasses reckless disregard and deliberate ignorance of a material fact. We are also revising
this section to comport with the OBRA 89 amendments that allow the Inspector General to impose civil monetary penalties
when a physician signs a certification when he or she knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the
risks of transfer, or when the physician misrepresents an individual's condition or other information. We are also
revising proposed &sect;1003.102(d) to eliminate the reference to a ``knowing'' standard (that is, a physician
knowingly failed to provide care). This results in a clearer approach that sets forth our basis for imposing civil
monetary penalties for violations of section 1867 of the Act and is consistent with the statutory amendments and with
other revisions to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.103: We are revising this section in accordance with section 1867(d) of the Act, as amended by
section 4008 of OBRA 90, to clarify that the OIG may impose a penalty of not more than $50,000 against a participating
hospital and a penalty of not more than $50,000 against each responsible physician (and not more than $25,000 against
a participating hospital and each responsible physician for violations on or after August 1, 1986, but before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 22, 1987) for violations determined under &sect;1003.102(d). For penalties imposed on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 1, 1991, if the hospital has fewer than 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds, the maximum penalty will be $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.105: We are revising this section to comport with the OBRA 90 amendments to section 1867 of the
Act by specifying in &sect;1003.105(a)(1) that a physician who grossly and flagrantly or repeatedly violates the
statute or &sect;489.24 may be excluded from Medicare and any State health care program. We are also revising &sect;1003.105(b)
to clarify that, for determinations under &sect;&sect;1003.102 (b)(2) and (b)(3), and for violations under &sect;1003.102(c)(1)(ii)
occurring on or after December 22, 1987 and before July 1, 1990, a physician may not be excluded if the OIG determines
he or she is a sole community physician or the sole source of specialized services in that community. We are moving references
to limitations in time periods of exclusion to &sect;1003.107. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.105: Effective December 22, 1987, the statute was amended to allow the Secretary, pursuant to
section 1842(j)(2) of the Act, to exclude a physician who knowingly violated section 1867 of the Act. In OBRA 89 Congress
amended section 1867, allowing the Secretary, pursuant to section 1128A (instead of section 1842(j)(2)), to exclude
a physician who knowingly and willfully or negligently violated the statute. The statute was then amended in OBRA
90, changing the standard for exclusion from ``knowing and willful or negligent'' to ``gross and flagrant or repeated'',
effective May 1, 1991. We are implementing this provision in &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii)(C). In addition, in accordance
with section 1842(j)(3) of the Act, the physician may not be excluded if the physician is the sole community physician
or sole source of essential specialized services in a community. We are revising &sect;1003.105(b) to include these
exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.106: As indicated in a response to one of the comments, in accordance with the requirements of
section 1128A(d) of the Act, the final regulation includes two additional factors for consideration in determining
the amount of the penalty and the length of the exclusion under part 1003: (1) ``The financial condition of the hospital
and each responsible physician who have violated any requirement of section 1867 of the Act,'' and (2) ``The nature
and circumstances of the violation.'' We are adding &sect;1003.106(a)(4) to reflect these provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 1003.107: The regulations now reflect the requirement of section 1842(j)(3) of the Act that if an exclusion
is based upon section 1842(j)(2) of the Act, then the access of beneficiaries to physician's services must be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.108: We are revising this section to include the terms ``assessment'' and ``exclusion.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Technical revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have revised the regulation to reflect the statutory amendments relating to the term ``active labor.'' Section
6211(h)(1)(B) of OBRA 89 removed the term from the statutory definitions section (section 1867(e) of the Act) and
the concept it applied to was incorporated into the definition of emergency medical condition. Hence, in many areas
of the regulations, only the term ``emergency medical condition'' is included. However, the statute still uses the
term ``labor'' in certain circumstances, and the regulations reflect this where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 6211(g) (1) and (2) of OBRA 89, the words ``patient,'' ``patients'' and ``patient's'' are replaced
by the words ``individual,'' ``individuals'' and ``individual's'', respectively, each place they appear in &sect;&sect;489.24
and 489.53 in reference to hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we have redesignated proposed &sect;405.1903 in this interim final rule as &sect;488.18(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless the Secretary certifies that an interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). For purposes of the RFA, we consider all hospitals to be small entities.
Individuals and states are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define
a small rural hospital as a hospital that has fewer than 100 beds and is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical
Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this rule merely conform the regulations to the legislative provisions of sections 9121 and 9122
of COBRA (as amended by section 4009 of OBRA 87), section 233 of the Veteran's Benefit Improvement and Health Care Authorization
Act of 1986, sections 9305 (b)(1) and 9307 of OBRA 86, section 4009 of OBRA 87, sections 6003(g)(3)(d)(XIV), 6018 and
6211 of OBRA 89 and sections 4008(b), 4027(a) and 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this rule will require Medicare participating hospitals to provide inpatient services to individuals
with insurance coverage under CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, and VA programs, provide each Medicare beneficiary a statement
of his or her rights concerning discharge from the hospital and provide an appropriate medical screening examination
to anyone who requests examination or treatment, and stabilizing treatment in the emergency room to any individual
with an emergency medical condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by the statute these provisions are in effect and are being enforced. Although hospitals may incur incremental
costs to ensure compliance with these provisions, we believe the costs are minimal and the benefits to individuals
far outweigh those costs. These provisions will allow military personnel and their families to receive inpatient
services in hospitals that may be closer to their homes as opposed to receiving services in military hospitals that
may be some distance away. Another benefit will be that all individuals will receive medical screening and, if an emergency
medical condition exists, will also receive stabilizing treatment and protections against inappropriate transfers
regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare. We believe that these provisions will improve access to
care and reduce patient complaints. The potential use of sanctions provides the incentive for hospitals to ensure
continued compliance with these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included a voluntary impact analysis in section VII of the preamble in the June 16, 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 22513).
We received no comments on that analysis, and we believe that none of the changes incorporated into this interim final
rule have any significant impact. Therefore, we are not preparing a similar analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that these final regulations will
not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact
on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility
analysis or an analysis of effects on small rural hospitals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management

VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 488.18(d), 489.20 (m) and (r), and 489.24 (c), (d) and (g) of this interim final rule contain information
collection requirements that are subject to the Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980. The information collections in &sect;&sect;488.18, 489.20(m), and 489.24 require the State agencies
to notify HCFA when hospitals are not in compliance with provisions contained in the Medicare provider agreement.
Section 489.20(m) also requires that a hospital report to HCFA or a Medicare state survey agency when the hospital
believes it has received an individual who has been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another
hospital in violation of the requirements of &sect;489.24(d). Section 489.20(r) now requires both transferring
and receiving hospitals to develop and maintain lists of on-call physicians and central logs containing information
about what services the individual did or did not receive and applicable patient records on admissions, discharges,
and transfers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under &sect;489.24 (c) and (d), transferring hospitals must send receiving hospitals an individual's
medical records (or copies) available at the time of the transfer, and the individual's other medical records must
be sent as soon as practicable after the transfer. The provisions also require hospitals to record certain information
on individuals' medical records, require individuals to sign consent forms pertaining to examinations, treatments
and transfers, and require physicians and other qualified medical personnel, when a physician is not present in the
emergency department but in consultation with the physician, to sign transfer certifications containing specific
information. Section 489.24(g) also requires PROs to prepare reports regarding individuals' medical conditions
when requested by HCFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 489.27 of the proposed rule required that hospitals that participate in the Medicare program obtain from
the beneficiary or his or her representative a signed acknowledgement of receipt of a notice of discharge rights.
We also required these hospitals to retain both a copy of the inpatient notice of discharge rights (``Message'') and
of the signed acknowledgement for 1 year. As discussed in section IV.B. of this preamble, this interim final rule eliminates
the requirement for an acknowledgement statement. Thus, the accompanying recordkeeping burden also is eliminated.

IX. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requires us to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and afford prior public comment on proposed rules. Such notice includes a statement of the time, place and nature of
the rulemaking proceeding, reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms or substance
of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. However, this requirement does not apply
when an agency finds good cause that prior notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public
interest, and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rules instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule with comment period includes a number of revisions to our regulations that implement revisions
to the Act under OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 and for which we did not propose rulemaking. These particular regulation revisions
implement the statute without interpretation; the statutory changes are self-implementing. Most of the revisions
are technical; some substantive ones (such as the notice hospitals are required to post concerning Medicaid) have
already been implemented; others are changes that would respond to public comments we have already received. Affording
a proposed rulemaking process under these circumstances is not in the public interest as it would delay the promulgation
of regulations that correspond to the current statute; because the statutory revisions are self-implementing,
we do not anticipate that public comment would substantively modify regulations. Therefore, we find good cause to
waive proposed rulemaking for those regulatory provisions necessary to implement OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. However, we
are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this rule, on changes to the regulations
resulting from the provisions of OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. After considering comments that are received timely, we will
respond to the comments, include any changes in the rule that might be necessitated in light of those comments, and
publish a final rule in the

X. Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we receive on a rulemaking document, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and, we will respond to the comments in the preamble of the final rule.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the case of a hospital that has an emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare
benefits and regardless of ability to pay) comes by him or herself or with another person to the emergency department
and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment of a medical condition by qualified medical
personnel (as determined by the hospital in its rules and regulations), the hospital must provide for an appropriate
medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary
services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition
exists. The examinations must be conducted by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws or rules and
regulations and who meet the requirements of &sect;482.55 concerning emergency services personnel and direction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Capacity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the ability of the hospital to accommodate the individual requesting examination or treatment of the transferred
individual. Capacity encompasses such things as numbers and availability of qualified staff, beds and equipment
and the hospital's past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.

Comes to the emergency department
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means, with respect to an individual requesting examination or treatment, that the individual is on the hospital
property (property includes ambulances owned and operated by the hospital, even if the ambulance is not on hospital
grounds). An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property is considered to have come to the hospital's
emergency department. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not considered to
have come to the hospital's emergency department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital by
telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want to transport the individual to the
hospital for examination and treatment. In such situations, the hospital may deny access if it is in ``diversionary
status,'' that is, it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients. If, however,
the ambulance staff disregards the hospital's instructions and transports the individual on to hospital property,
the individual is considered to have come to the emergency department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare benefits) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines
that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for further medical examination
and treatment as required to stabilize the medical condition; or

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Refusal to consent to treatment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital
offers the individual the further medical examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the
individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the examination
and treatment, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to the examination
and treatment. The medical record must contain a description of the examination, treatment, or both if applicable,
that was refused by or on behalf of the individual. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's
written informed refusal (or that of the person acting on his or her behalf). The written document should indicate
that the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the examination or treatment, or both.

A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital
offers to transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and
informs the individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the transfer,
but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to the transfer. The hospital
must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal (or that of a person acting on his
or her behalf). The written document must indicate the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer
and state the reasons for the individual's refusal. The medical record must contain a description of the proposed
transfer that was refused by or on behalf of the individual.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized (as defined in paragraph
(b) of this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii)(A) The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer,
after being informed of the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of transfer. The request must
be in writing and indicate the reasons for the request as well as indicate that he or she is aware of the risks and benefits
of the transfer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A physician (within the meaning of section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) has signed a certification that, based upon the
information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate
medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or, in the case of a woman
in labor, to the woman or the unborn child, from being transferred. The certification must contain a summary of the
risks and benefits upon which it is based; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time an individual is transferred,
a qualified medical person (as determined by the hospital in its by-laws or rules and regulations) has signed a certification
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section after a physician (as defined in section 1861(r)(1) of the Act)
in consultation with the qualified medical person, agrees with the certification and subsequently countersigns
the certification. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based.

(2) A transfer to another medical facility will be appropriate only in those cases in which_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The transferring hospital provides medical treatment within its capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's
health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The receiving facility_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) related
to the emergency condition which the individual has presented that are available at the time of the transfer, including
available history, records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or symptoms,
preliminary diagnosis, results of diagnostic studies or telephone reports of the studies, treatment provided,
results of any tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy thereof) required under paragraph
(d)(1)(ii) of this section, and the name and address of any on-call physician (described in paragraph (f) of this section)
who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. Other records
(e.g., test results not yet available or historical records not readily available from the hospital's files) must
be sent as soon as practicable after transfer; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including
the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A participating hospital may not penalize or take adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because the physician or qualified medical person refuses
to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, or against
any hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, in cases where a medical opinion is necessary to determine
a physician's or hospital's liability under section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, HCFA requests the appropriate PRO (with
a contract under Part B of title XI of the Act) to review the alleged section 1867(d) violation and provide a report on
its findings in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section. HCFA provides to the PRO all information
relevant to the case and within its possession or control. HCFA, in consultation with the OIG, also provides to the
PRO a list of relevant questions to which the PRO must respond in its report.

certified mail date on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The physician or hospital (or both where applicable) may request a meeting with the PRO. This meeting is not designed
to be a formal adversarial hearing or a mechanism for discovery by the physician or hospital. The meeting is intended
to afford the physician and/or the hospital a full and fair opportunity to present the views of the physician and/or
hospital regarding the case. The following provisions apply to that meeting:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The physician and/or hospital has the right to have legal counsel present during that meeting. However, the PRO
may control the scope, extent, and manner of any questioning or any other presentation by the attorney. The PRO may
also have legal counsel present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The PRO makes arrangements so that, if requested by HCFA or the OIG, a verbatim transcript of the meeting may be generated.
If HCFA or OIG requests a transcript, the affected physician and/or the affected hospital may request that HCFA provide
a copy of the transcript.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The PRO affords the physician and/or the hospital an opportunity to present, with the assistance of counsel, expert
testimony in either oral or written form on the medical issues presented. However, the PRO may reasonably limit the
number of witnesses and length of such testimony if such testimony is irrelevant or repetitive. The physician and/or
hospital, directly or through counsel, may disclose patient records to potential expert witnesses without violating
any non-disclosure requirements set forth in part 476 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The PRO is not obligated to consider any additional information provided by the physician and/or the hospital
after the meeting, unless, before the end of the meeting, the PRO requests that the physician and/or hospital submit
additional information to support the claims. The PRO then allows the physician and/or the hospital an additional
period of time, not to exceed 5 calendar days from the meeting, to submit the relevant information to the PRO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Within 60 calendar days of receiving the case, the PRO must submit to HCFA a report on the PRO's findings. HCFA provides
copies to the OIG and to the affected physician and/or the affected hospital. The report must contain the name of the
physician and/or the hospital, the name of the individual, and the dates and times the individual arrived at and was
transferred (or discharged) from the hospital. The report provides expert medical opinion regarding whether the
individual involved had an emergency medical condition, whether the individual's emergency medical condition
was stabilized, whether the individual was transferred appropriately, and whether there were any medical utilization
or quality of care issues involved in the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The report required under paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section should not state an opinion or conclusion as to
whether section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 has been violated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was no screening examination, the
PRO review described in this section is not required before the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties or an exclusion
in accordance with section 1867(d)(1) of the Act and 42 CFR part 1003 of this title.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the PRO determines after a preliminary review that there was an appropriate medical screening examination
and the individual did not have an emergency medical condition, as defined by paragraph (b) of this section, then the
PRO may, at its discretion, return the case to HCFA and not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) except for those in
paragraph (g)(2)(v).

to any penalty or assessment, to an exclusion from participation in Medicare for a period of time determined under
&sect;1003.107. The OIG will also direct each appropriate State agency to exclude the person from each health care
program for the same period of time_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any person who is subject to a penalty or assessment under &sect;1003.102 (a) or (b)(1) through (b)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any responsible physician who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Knowingly violates section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 of this title on or after December 22, 1987, but before
July 1, 1990; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Knowingly and willfully, or negligently, violates section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 of this title on or after
July 1, 1990 but before May 1, 1991; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Commits a gross and flagrant, or repeated, violation of section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 of this title on
or after May 1, 1991. For purposes of this section, a gross and flagrant violation is one that presents an imminent danger
to the health, safety or well-being of the individual who seeks emergency examination and treatment or places that
individual unnecessarily in a high-risk situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nothing in this section will be construed to limit the Department's authority to impose an exclusion without imposing
a penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) With respect to determinations under &sect;1003.102 (b)(2) or (b)(3), or with respect to violations occurring
on or after December 22, 1987 and before July 1, 1990 under &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii), a physician may not be excluded
if the OIG determines that he or she is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services
in a community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) With respect to any exclusion based on liability for a penalty or assessment under &sect;1003.102 (a), (b)(1),
or (b)(4), the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the person is the sole community physician
or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community. With respect to any exclusion imposed under &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii),
the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the physician's exclusion from the State health
care program would deny beneficiaries access to medical care or would otherwise cause hardship to beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a waiver is granted, it is applicable only to the State health care program for which the State requested the
waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the OIG subsequently obtains information that the basis for a waiver no longer exists, or the State agency
submits evidence that the basis for the waiver no longer exists, the waiver will cease and the person will be excluded
from the State health care program for the remainder of the period that the person is excluded from Medicare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The OIG notifies the State agency whether its request for a waiver has been granted or denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The decision to deny a waiver is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of this section, the definitions contained in &sect;1001.2 of this chapter for ``sole community
physician'' and ``sole source of essential specialized services in a community'' apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the Inspector General proposes to exclude a nursing facility from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, he
or she will, at the same time he or she notifies the respondent, notify the appropriate State licensing authority,
the State Office of Aging, the long-term care ombudsman, and the State Medicaid agency of the Inspector General's
intention to exclude the facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;You have the right to receive all the hospital care that is necessary for the proper diagnosis and treatment
of your illness or injury. According to Federal law, your discharge date must be determined solely by your medical
needs, not by ``Diagnosis Related Groups'' (DRGs) or Medicare payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;You have the right to be fully informed about decisions affecting your Medicare coverage and payment for your
hospital stay and for any post-hospital services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;You have the right to request a review by a Peer Review Organization (PRO) of any written Notice of Noncoverage
that you receive from the hospital stating that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care. PROs are groups
of doctors who are paid by the Federal Government to review medical necessity, appropriateness and quality of hospital
treatment furnished to Medicare patients. The phone number and address of the PRO for your area are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
You and your doctor know more about your condition and your health needs than anyone else. Decisions about your medical
treatment should be made between you and your doctor. If you have any questions about your medical treatment, your
need for continued hospital care, your discharge, or your need for possible post-hospital care, don't hesitate to
ask your doctor. The hospital's patient representative or social worker will also help you with your questions and
concerns about hospital services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Ask a hospital representative for a written notice of explanation immediately, if you have not already received
one. This notice is called a Notice of Noncoverage. You must have this Notice of Noncoverage if you wish to exercise
your right to request a review by the PRO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Notice of Noncoverage will state either that your doctor or the PRO agrees with the hospital's decision
that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_If the hospital and your doctor agree, the PRO does not review your case before a Notice of Noncoverage is issued. But
the PRO will respond to your request for a review of your Notice of Noncoverage and seek your opinion. You cannot be made
to pay for your hospital care until the PRO makes its decision, if you request the review by noon of the first work day
after you receive the Notice of Noncoverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the hospital and your doctor disagree, the hospital may request the PRO to review your case. If it does make such
a request, the hospital is required to send you a notice to that effect. In this situation the PRO must agree with the
hospital or the hospital cannot issue a Notice of Noncoverage. You may request that the PRO reconsider your case after
you receive a Notice of Noncoverage, but since the PRO has already reviewed your case once, you may have to pay for at
least one day of hospital care before the PRO completes this reconsideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you do not request a review, the hospital may bill you for all the costs of your stay beginning with the third day after
you receive the Notice of Noncoverage. The hospital, however, cannot charge you for care unless it provides you with
a Notice of Noncoverage.

_The PRO must ask for your views about your case before making its decision. The PRO will inform you by phone or in writing

Note:

The process described above is called ``immediate review.'' If you miss the deadline for this immediate review while
you are in the hospital, you may still request a review of Medicare's decision to no longer pay for your care at any point
during your hospital stay or after you have left the hospital. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 will tell you how to request this review.

Post-Hospital Care
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When your doctor determines that you no longer need all the specialized services provided in a hospital, but you still
require medical care, he or she may discharge you to a skilled nursing facility or home care. The discharge planner
at the hospital will help arrange for the services you may need after your discharge. Medicare and supplemental insurance
policies have limited coverage for skilled nursing facility care and home health care. Therefore, you should find
out which services will or will not be covered and how payment will be made. Consult with your doctor, hospital discharge
planner, patient representative, and your family in making preparations for care after you leave the hospital. Don't
hesitate to ask questions.

Appendix II_Posting of Signs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6018(a)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), effective July 1, 1990, requires
hospitals and rural primary care hospitals with emergency departments to post signs which specify the rights (under
section 1867 of the Social Security Act) of women in labor and individuals with emergency medical conditions to examination
and treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with these requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;At a minimum, the signs must specify the rights of unstable individuals with emergency conditions and women
in labor who come to the emergency department for health care services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It must indicate whether the facility participates in the Medicaid program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The wording of the sign must be clear and in simple terms understandable by the population serviced; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Print the signs in English and other major languages that are common to the population of the area serviced;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The letters within the signs must be clearly readable at a distance of at least 20 feet or the expected vantage
point of the emergency department patrons; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Post signs in a place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the emergency department, as
well as those individuals waiting for examination and treatment (e.g., entrance, admitting area, waiting room,
treatment area). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year)
flood elevations for new buildings and their contents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation determinations
are available for inspection is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes the final determinations listed below of the final determinations
of modified base (100-year) flood elevations for each community listed. These modified elevations have been published
in newspapers of local circulation and ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Associate Director
has resolved any appeals resulting from this notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this rule
includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation
determinations are available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to
calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made
final, and for the contents in these buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base (100-year) elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for EPA Acquisition Regulations (EPAAR). Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those
information requirements promulgated under the EPAAR which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulations
(FAR). The affected regulations are codified at 48 CFR part 1532. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers
in a consolidated table format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be codified in 48 CFR part 1501 of the EPAAR, in 40 CFR part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each 40 CFR volume containing
EPA regulations. The table lists the part and section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and
the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control numbers and their subsequent codification in the
Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICR(s) were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 49 CFR 5.11, any person may petition the Secretary of Transportation to issue, amend, or repeal a rule, or for
a permanent or temporary exemption from any rule. Under 49 CFR 5.13, if the Secretary determines that the petition
contains adequate justification, he is authorized to initiate rulemaking action or grant the exemption. If the Secretary
determines that the petition does not contain adequate justification, he is authorized to deny the petition. The
Secretary is also authorized to notify the petitioner of the decision. This rule delegates to the General Counsel
the Secretary of Transportation's authority to deny a petition for rulemaking or a petition for exemption and to notify
the petitioner of the denial.

Since this rule relates to departmental management, organization, procedure, and practice, notice and public comment
are unnecessary. For the same reason, good cause exists for not publishing this rule at least 30 days before its effective
date, as is ordinarily required by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Therefore, this rule is effective on the date of its publication.

 NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery
(FMP) and issues final regulations to implement it. This rule continues on a permanent basis three measures originally
imposed by a temporary emergency rule: A 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit for haddock year-round for all vessels
permitted under the FMP and for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); a
prohibition on scallop dredge vessels from possessing or landing haddock from January through June; and an extension
of the time period of the closure of Closed Area II to 6 months (from January through June), rather than 4 months (February
through May), in 1995. The intended effect of this rule is to protect depleted haddock stocks.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplementary and background information on Amendment 6 and the proposed implementing regulations (which were
initiated by NMFS rather than the New England Fishery Management Council (Council)) was published in the preamble
to the proposed rule to implement Amendment 6 (59 FR 18092, on April 15, 1994), and is not repeated here. All three of
the measures contained in this final rule are also contained in the emergency rule that is effective through June 30,
1994 (59 FR 15656, April 4, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council voted on February 17 to begin the resubmission process for the disapproved 5,000-lb (2,268-kg) haddock
possession limit in Amendment 5 to the FMP by submitting a 750-pound (340-kg) possession limit. The 750-pound (340-kg)
limit was recommended by the Council on the basis of Plan Development Team and Council staff analysis of the haddock
fishery. The 750-pound (340-kg) limit and a proposed implementing rule were submitted to NMFS on March 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1994, NMFS disapproved the Council's 750-pound (340-kg) limit because it was determined to be inconsistent
with National Standard 1 of the Magnuson Act, which requires that management measures prevent overfishing while
achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the U.S. fishing industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination was based, in part, on data from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) that indicate
that current haddock catches are generally less than 500 pounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(226.8 kg). The Council's argument that a 750-pound (340-kg) limit would allow vessels to keep what would be discarded
anyway, therefore, was no longer relevant to this segment of the multispecies fishery. This additional information
which was available to NMFS at the time the resubmission was disapproved, but not available to the Council at the time
of its analysis, underscores the appropriateness of a 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit in order to ensure maximum
protection to this severely depleted resource. Accordingly, the 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit is included
in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS also determined that, because scallop vessels fish in Closed Area II during the period when haddock are congregated
to spawn, all scallop dredge vessels should be prohibited from landing or possessing haddock during the closed period
to ensure that such vessels do not target these concentrations of haddock. While the Council requested that the Regional
Director consider whether scallop dredges should be prohibited from being in the area during the closure, instead
of being prohibited from possessing or landing haddock, the information provided by the NEFSC of NMFS did not support
precluding scallopers from the closed area. Accordingly the prohibition from possessing or landing haddock is included
in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the resubmission package did not propose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the time closure of Closed Area II. The data acquired by the NEFSC since the Council's analysis supports
an extension of the time closure in 1995, rather than beginning in 1996, as stipulated in Amendment 5. The expansion
of Closed Area II in time for 1995 will provide additional protection to the concentrations of haddock that occur in
the area. The closure of Area II beginning in January rather than February, and ending at the end of June rather than
at the end of May, should ensure that haddock beginning to concentrate in the area are provided the fullest protection.
Accordingly, an extension of the time period of the closure is included in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final
rule.

Written comments on the proposed rule to Amendment 6 to the FMP were received by the NMFS from the Center for Marine Conservation
(CMC) and from the Council. The Council had no specific comment on the proposed rule but went on record at its May 11&hyph;12,
1994, meeting and again in writing on May 13, as supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 6. In addition, on March 8, 1994, prior to the beginning of the comment period for the proposed rule to implement
Amendment 6, the Council submitted comments on proposed Amendment 6 and its EA/RIR.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council commented that proposed Amendment 6 and its EA/RIR had several deficiencies in content and format including:
The need for a ``Purpose and need'' section, a clear statement of objectives of the Amendment, a description of the
consistency of the Amendment with the national standards of Magnuson Act, evidence that the Amendment's possession
limit for haddock promotes efficiency in the utilization of the resource, a section describing the Amendment's relationship
to other applicable law, better evidence that the 500-pound possession limit is the proper preferred alternative
compared to several incremental amounts higher than 500 pounds, and a convincing argument justifying preparation
of an EA rather than an EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final EA/RIR of Amendment 6 has been revised to contain a ``Purpose and Need'' section (page 4), an improved objectives
statement (page 5), consistency of the Amendment with national standards (page 75), evidence that the 500-pound
haddock possession limit promotes efficiency of the resource, and effects of the preferred possession limit on the
resource (pages 19&hyph;27), a discussion of compliance of the Amendment with other applicable law (pages 72&hyph;76),
a comparison of the effects of the preferred alternative versus several different haddock possession limit amounts
(pages 19&hyph;37), and a convincing argument for preparation of an EA rather than an EIS (pages 38, 72, and 73).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CMC supported the protective measures contained in Amendment 6 and suggested the possession limit on haddock
be reflected in three standard totes, consistent with the Council's recommendation from its May (1994) meeting.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council and the NMFS are aware of the need to ensure that the haddock possession limit is adhered to strictly. The
standard tote, or box, measure is currently under review to determine whether the number of totes allowed is sufficiently
equivalent to 500 lb (226.8 kg).

Changes from the Proposed Rule

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;651.9(a)(12) and (e)(34), the phrase ``or the equivalent in totes or boxes'' is added to reflect the language
in the amendment and to clarify the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 651.27(b)(1)(iii) is added to clarify who is subject to the haddock possession limit and provisions specified
in &sect;651.27(b)(2).

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce, when this rule was proposed, certified to the Small Business Administration
that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Fishing vessels
that will be subject to this rule rarely take more than 500-lb (226.8-kg) of haddock per trip because of the severely
depleted status of the stock. Based on the most recent catch statistics, 68 percent of the fishing trips landing groundfish
landed no haddock, 84 percent involved less than 500 lb (226.8 kg). The allowable bycatch of 500 pounds (226.8 kg) is
expected to discourage vessels from targeting haddock, promoting rebuilding of the stock that will result in long
term benefits to the groundfish fleet. The measures in this rule will not result in a reduction of annual gross revenues
of more than 5 percent. Annual compliance costs are not expected to increase total costs by more than 5 percent and are
not expected to be substantially higher for small, as compared to large, business entities. The measures will not
force more than 2 percent of small business entities to cease business operations. As a result, an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds that under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure
Act, there is good cause to waive part of the 30-day delay in effectiveness and make this rule effective on June 30, 1994.
This effective date will avoid a one or two-week hiatus between the effective date of this rule with a 30-day delay in
effective date and the expiration of the emergency rule on June 30, 1994, that imposes the three management measures
contained in this final rule. This will avoid confusion in the fishery, continue protection of badly depleted stocks
of haddock from further overfishing; and enhance the likelihood that abundance of those stocks begin replenishment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementing regulations at 50 CFR 630.24(b)(1)(i)(A) establish a quota of 69,286 lbs (31,428 kg) of swordfish
that may be harvested by drift gillnet during the period January 1 through June 30, each year. Under 50 CFR 630.25(a),
NMFS is required to close the drift gillnet fishery for swordfish when its quota is reached, or is projected to be reached,
by filing a notice with the Office of the Federal Register at least 8 days before the closure is to become effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the current level of swordfish catch by drift gillnets, historic data on average catch per set for June, and
the number of vessels fishing or expected to fish, NMFS has determined that the drift gillnet quota for the January
1 through June 30 period will be reached on or before June 25, 1994. Hence, the drift gillnet fishery for Atlantic swordfish
is closed effective 0001 hours, local time, June 25, 1994, through June 30, 1994, when a new semiannual quota becomes
available. NMFS may adjust the July 1 through December 31, 1994, drift gillnet quota to reflect actual catches made
in the January 1 through June 30, 1994, semiannual period as specified in 50 CFR 630.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During this closure of the drift gillnet fishery: (1) A person aboard a vessel using or having aboard a drift gillnet
may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock; (2) no more than two swordfish per trip may be possessed
in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5

SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is proposing to amend its regulations for nonreactor licensees on decommissioning
financial assurance, and expiration and termination of licenses. These amendments are intended to clarify that
financial assurance must be in place during operations and updated when the licensee decides to cease operations
and begin decommissioning. These amendments would explicitly describe the financial assurance certification
requirements for licensees during operation, the implementation and timing requirements for licensees whose licenses
have been in timely renewal since the promulgation of the 1988 decommissioning funding rules, and for licensees who
cease operations without adequate funding arrangements in place.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1983, the Commission amended 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, and 70 to add requirements addressing ``Expiration and Termination
of Licenses'' (10 CFR 30.36, 40.42, and 70.38 (48 FR 32324; July 15,1983)). Similar provisions were added to 10 CFR
Part 72 in 1988 (10 CFR 72.54 (53 FR 24018)). These requirements set out the procedures to be followed by a licensee who
decides to decommission a facility and seek termination of the applicable license. Under certain circumstances
(which apply when a Part 30, 40, 70, or 72 licensee has more than a modest amount of radioactive contamination to remediate),
the licensee is required to submit a decommissioning plan that lays out the methods and measures for decontamination
of the property and equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, the Commission promulgated rules addressing ``Financial Assurance and Recordkeeping for Decommissioning''
(10 CFR 30.35, 40.36, 70.25 and 72.30 (53 FR 24018; June 27,1988)). These rules established a graded structure for
financial assurance that relates the amount of the financial assurance required of a licensee to the possession limits
in his or her license. The graded structure is based on the reasonable assumption that the kinds and quantities of radioactive
materials authorized in the license provide a reasonably good correlation to the amount of contamination that has
to be remediated. Further, Part 30, 40, or 70 applicants or licensees whose possession limits exceed or would exceed
a certain level, and all Part 72 licensees and license applicants must provide an estimate of the actual expected decommissioning
cost as part of their application for a license or for license renewal. The estimated costs are reviewed and approved
by the Commission. Before the license is issued or renewed, the applicant must provide financial assurance in one
or more of the forms required by the rule (prepayment, surety, insurance or other guarantee, or external sinking fund
with a backup surety). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same June 27, 1988, final rule also added a requirement that decommissioning plans include an updated detailed
cost estimate for decommissioning, a comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for decommissioning,
and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate funds for the completion of decommissioning. The intent in promulgating
these rules was to ensure that adequate funds would be available to cover the costs of decommissioning NRC licensed
facilities. At the time the decommissioning funding rules were promulgated, it was not anticipated that a licensee
would move to decommissioning without having complied earlier with the financial assurance requirements. Since
that time a number of licensees who were in timely renewal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., licensees who had timely filed an application for renewal of their licenses and whose licenses, therefore, continued
in effect while the renewal applications were being acted upon) when the June 27, 1988, rule became effective have
decided to terminate their activities and begin decommissioning. Other licensees that only provided certification
for the minimum amounts of financial assurance have also decided to terminate activities and begin decommissioning.
In both situations, insufficient funding was in place when the licensee ceased operations and began decommissioning.
These amendments are intended to clarify that financial assurances must be in place and updated when the licensee
decides to cease operations and begin decommissioning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments proposed here would amend those sections in 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72 dealing with assurance of
adequate funding for decommissioning. These changes would more explicitly describe the implementation and timing
requirements for licensee financial assurance instruments and clarify that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Licensees who have applied for license renewal must provide financial assurance for decommissioning during
the period that they remain in timely renewal. This is addressed through the addition of Paragraph (c)(4) to &sect;&sect;30.35,
40.36, and 70.25. Licensees currently in timely renewal would need to have the required financial assurance instrument
when this rule if adopted as a final rule, becomes effective, 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Specific comments are solicited on the adequacy of the 90 day time period for licensees currently in timely renewal
to obtain the required financial assurance instrument; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each decommissioning funding plan must include a certification by the licensee that financial assurance for
decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate. This is addressed through a modification to
Paragraph (e) of &sect;&sect;30.35, 40.36, and 70.25; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The decommissioning financial assurances provided by the licensee in conjunction with a license renewal or issuance
must remain in effect during the period of decommissioning and must be increased or may be decreased, as appropriate,
within 90 days of the licensee notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license. This is necessary
to cover the detailed estimated decommissioning costs developed as part of the decommissioning plan. This is addressed
through the addition of Paragraph (b)(2) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2) to &sect;72.54;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any licensee who submits a notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license, and has not
provided appropriate financial assurance for decommissioning, shall do so within 90 days of the notice. This is addressed
through the addition of a new Paragraph (b)(2)(i) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2)(i)
to &sect;72.54. Any licensee who has already submitted a notice of termination of activities and request to terminate
the license would need to have the required financial assurance instrument when this rule, if adopted as a final rule,
becomes effective, 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Licensees may reduce the amount of financial assurance semiannually as decommissioning proceeds and radiological
contamination is reduced at the site, with the approval of the Commission. This is addressed through the addition
of a new Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) to &sect;72.54.
The semiannual interval is proposed as a balance between the financial incentive that this provision gives to licensees
to proceed promptly with the decommissioning work after approval of the decommissioning plan and the burden imposed
on both the licensee and staff in implementing a reduction. Specific comments are solicited on the interval proposed.

Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared this proposed regulation to clarify its decommissioning funding requirements for persons
licensed under Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72. Although it does alter existing requirements, regulatory analyses developed
in support of prior decommissioning regulations remain valid and appropriate for this rulemaking because these
analyses assumed that all licensees would submit a certification of financial assurance to the NRC of a rule prescribed
amount, or licensee estimated and NRC approved amount, necessary to provide adequate funds to decommission the licensed
facility and that licensees would have complied with the decommissioning funding requirements prior to ceasing
operations and commencing decommissioning. These prior analyses, developed for the rules on expiration and termination
licenses and financial assurances for decommissioning, remain available for inspection in the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. This discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for
this proposed rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC carefully considered the effect on
small entities in developing the final rule on decommissioning funding and scaled the requirements to reduce the
impact on small entities to the extent possible while adequately protecting health and safety. Therefore, it is not
expected to have an impact on licensees not already analyzed in the regulatory flexibility analysis for the decommissioning
funding rule as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 27, 1988 (53 FR 24018). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have any additional significant
economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Backfit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule, and therefore, a backfit analysis
is not required for this rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as
defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under OTS's capital rule, 12 CFR 567.1, common stockholders' equity, the primary component of core capital for most
savings associations, includes items that are generally the same as the items that comprised GAAP equity, when the
capital rule was adopted. Today's proposal would revise the OTS's definition of common stockholders' equity in order
to incorporate a change in GAAP made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, in May 1993, when it issued SAFAS
No. 115.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SFAS No. 115 requires that most debt and equity securities be reported at fair value, rather than at amortized cost.
It supersedes SFAS No. 12, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When SFAS No. 115 becomes effective,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities will be included in GAAP equity. On August 10, 1993,
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council announced that it will adopt SFAS No. 115, and that it will
require all federally supervised banks and savings associations to adopt SFAS No. 115. The OTS and the Federal banking
regulatory agencies announced their intention to proposed amendments to their respective capital rules to make
the rules reflect the accounting and reporting standards contained in SFAS No. 115.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
SFAS No. 115 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. SFAS No. 115, however, includes
early adoption provisions, under which savings associations may adopt its standards as early as June 30, 1993, depending
on when their fiscal years end.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1463(b)(2), requires the OTS to prescribe accounting
standards that ``incorporate [GAAP] to the same degree that such principles are used to determine compliance with
regulations prescribed by the Federal banking agencies.'' The proposal revises the OTS definition of common stockholders'
equity so that it will be consistent with the change in GAAP made by SFAS No. 115. It is similar to amendments the other
Federal banking agencies have proposed to their respective capital rules in order to incorporate the modification
of GAAP made by SFAS No. 115.

II. Comment Solicitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS solicits comment on all aspects of the proposal, but is particularly interested in comments on the following
specific questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. If the SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses are included in regulatory capital, how should OTS include these
adjustments in its calculations?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in core capital for purposes of the leverage ratio requirement?

requirement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in supplementary capital for purposes of the risk-based
capital requirement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in capital for purposes of Prompt Corrective Action
(PCA)? If so, should the OTS initiate a rulemaking to amend the PCA capital definitions (i.e., tangible equity) or
capital categories to ameliorate the statutory effects resulting from the potential volatility due to SFAS No. 115
adjustments?

of SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses in capital? Would such changes increase or decrease the risk to the Savings

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 601), it is certified
that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small savings associations.
This proposed regulation simply revises the definition of common stockholders' equity included in the OTS capital
rule so that it will include a new component of GAAP equity that was added to GAAP equity by SFAS No. 115. Section 4(b)(2)
of HOLA requires the OTS to promulgate accounting standards that incorporate GAAP standards to the same degree that
those standards are used by the Federal banking agencies.

The Director of the OTS has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes
of Executive Order 12866. The OTS proposes to revise its capital definition, in order to bring it into conformity with
SFAS No. 115, and to ensure that its definition of common stockholders' equity is consistent with those of the other
Federal banking agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft
Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters. This proposal would require the removal and replacement of the
transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear) within certain time intervals and would establish a retirement life
for the ring gear. This proposal is prompted by reports of failures of the ring gear due to slow-growth fatigue cracks.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the ring gear, failure of the main transmission,
and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft
Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters. There have been four failures of the transmission main gear box
ring gear (ring gear), part number (P/N) S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2, reported by the manufacturer. The failures were
caused by a slow-growth fatigue crack in a single tooth on the drive side of the ring gear. The ring gear is a critical
part in the main transmission. Therefore, any cracks in the teeth of the ring gear create an unsafe condition. This
condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the ring gear, failure of the main transmission, and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin No. 58B35&hyph;32, dated July 6, 1993,
that describes procedures for removal and replacement of the ring gear, provides a new mandatory retirement life
for the ring gear, provides for originating a component time-in-service record, and provides for marking a permanent
serial number on zero-time and replacement ring gears as well as ring gears removed for servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require removing and replacing the ring gear within certain time intervals, establishing
a mandatory retirement life of 2,500 hours' total time-in-service, originating a component service record, and
marking a serial number on the ring gear, P/N S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 125 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
31.5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $2,000 per ring gear. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $466,562. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear), failure of the main transmission, and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) From component records, determine the TIS for the ring gear, part number (P/N) S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the TIS on the ring gear is 2,400 or more hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized
ring gear within the next 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the TIS on the ring gear is less than 2,400 hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy
serialized ring gear at or before reaching 2,500 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the TIS on the ring gear cannot be determined, replace it in accordance with the time since last overhaul (TSO)
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the TSO on the ring gear is 1,150 or more hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized
ring gear within the next 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the TSO on the ring gear is less than 1,150 hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace with an airworthy serialized
ring gear at or before reaching 1,250 hours' TSO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Create a component log and a serial number and apply the serial number to the ring gear between the ring gear flanges
in accordance with Paragraph B of the Accomplishment Instructions of Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service No. 58B35&hyph;32
(ASB 58B35&hyph;32), dated July 6, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Create a component log and a serial number for replacement ring gears and apply the serial number to the ring gear
between the ring gear flanges in accordance with Paragraph B of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB 58B35&hyph;32,
dated July 6, 1993, prior to installing a replacement ring gear on the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This AD establishes a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS for the ring gear. However, ring gears with 2,400 or more
hours' TIS or, if the TIS cannot be determined, 1,150 or more hours' TSO on the effective date of this AD, need not be retired
until on or before the accumulation of an additional 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit
their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager,
Boston Aircraft Certification Office.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to modify the official description of the Class D airspace associated with the Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City,
Michigan. The modification was to allow a variation to the class D airspace effective times to coincide with the operating
hours of the Traverse City ATCT (99 FR 23642). The NPRM is being withdrawn since this section is contained in Airspace
Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;16, which was published in the

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at St. James Municipal Airport, St. James, MN, to accommodate a Nondirectional Beacon (NDB), Runway 32.
Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended
effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures from other aircraft
operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined area which would
enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1062), NOAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the natural resource damage
assessment and restoration regulations required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. NOAA requested comments, recommendations,
and technical information concerning appropriate assessment procedures and the overall assessment process. NOAA
also announced a series of regional meetings to discuss and solicit comments on the proposed rule (59 FR 1189). On March
1, 1994, NOAA extended the comment period to July 7, 1994 (59 FR 9688). Through today's Notice, NOAA announces a further
extension of the comment period to October 7, 1994. A summary of information gathered at the previously announced
regional meetings and specific issues on which NOAA seeks further comment will appear in a future Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Comment Period for Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since its first extension of time for public comment from April 7, 1994 to July 7, 1994, NOAA has received numerous requests
from States and other interested parties to extend the comment period for the proposed rule. As in the previous extension
requests, most requesters need more time to review the compensation formulas and its supporting documentation.
In addition, some requesters need additional time to review the body of literature supporting NOAA's proposal for
the use of contingent valuation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA is dedicated to encouraging a thorough and thoughtful review of all components of the proposed rule, and in particular
review and comment on the proposed compensation formulas and the economic methodology for estimating lost nonuse
values known as contingent valuation. Therefore, the comment period for the proposed rule on natural resource damage
assessment under the OPA is extended for ninety days. Comments on the proposed rule are now due on or before October
7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA is coordinating its rulemaking with a rulemaking being conducted by the Department of the Interior (DOI). DOI
has published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251
et seq.). (59 FR 23097) In a separate Notice in today's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, DOI is announcing the extension of the comment period on its proposed rule. The standards proposed for the assessment
of lost nonuse values contained in DOI's proposed rule are identical to those proposed by NOAA. Commenters on NOAA's
proposed standards for use of the economic methodology known as contingent valuation are encouraged to submit copies
of their comments both to NOAA, at the address provided at the beginning of this Notice, and to DOI at the address specified
in its notice appearing elsewhere in today's

., provides for the prevention of, liability for, removal of, and compensation for the discharge, or substantial
threat of discharge, of oil into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or the Exclusive
Economic Zone. Section 1006(e) requires the President, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans
and Atmosphere, to develop regulations establishing procedures for natural resource trustees to use in the assessment
of damages for injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of natural resources covered by OPA. Section 1006(b)
provides for the designation of federal, state, Indian tribe and foreign natural resource trustees to determine
resource injuries, assess natural resource damages (including the reasonable costs of assessing damages), present
a claim, recover damages, and develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or
acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources under their trusteeship.

 Notice. Within the preamble to the proposed rule, NOAA specifically listed a series of issues that were raised during
the various meetings and comments (at 59 FR 1071&hyph;1074). The goal of this statement of issues of interest was to
stimulate discussions on some of the more intriguing suggestions considered in developing the proposed rule.

After publication of the proposed rule, NOAA held six regional meetings in January and February of 1994 in New Orleans,
Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle. These meetings began with a discussion of the issues identified
in the preamble to the proposed rule, but were open to discussion of other issues. There was a diverse turnout, interest,
and response at those meetings. In response to requests from many interested parties, on March 1, 1994, NOAA extended
the comment period on the proposed rule to July 7, 1994. (59 Fed Reg 9688) A final workshop on March 25, 1994, was held
in Washington, D.C. A set of discussion papers was distributed at the Washington meeting. These discussion papers
reflected issues and questions raised during the regional meetings. The discussion papers were not intended to reflect
final agency position on any issue. Instead, they were intended to focus on some relevant questions raised by the rulemaking
to date. Although the Washington, D.C. meeting emphasized the issues presented in those papers, discussions on other
concerns were encouraged. These discussion papers have been incorporated into this Notice.

The 6 regional workshops of January and February 1994, were sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the Coastal States Organization (CSO). Attendance at the workshops
included federal, state, Indian, and foreign trustees, industry, protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) clubs, environmental
groups, and private citizens. Information disseminated for the workshops included NOAA's proposed rule, an outline
of the proposed rule, a draft memorandum of agreement, and an agenda for the workshops. The purpose of the agenda was
to reach agreement on many of the issues of cooperative NRDA through open discussion among participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Notice provides a summary of information, concerns and recommendations received by NOAA at the workshops and
requests further comment on specific issues raised by NOAA and members of the public at the workshops. In addition,
this Notice makes available to the public a document summarizing the proceedings at the six workshops on cooperative
damage assessment. The document entitled ``Summary Report of Six Cooperative Natural Resource Damage Assessment
Workshops'' is available upon request to the address provided above.

Issues on Injury and Related Concepts

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1002(a) and (b)(2) of OPA establish the elements for a natural resource damage claim. Under OPA, a party responsible
for a vessel or facility is liable if there is (1) a discharge or a substantial threat of discharge (2) of oil (3) from
the vessel or facility (4) into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the Exclusive Economic Zone. Damages
are measured in terms of the injury to natural resources resulting from such an incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Damages resulting from an incident include those associated with injury to, destruction of, loss of, and loss of use
of natural resources. OPA adds the phrase ``loss of use of'' which is not explicit under CERCLA. The proposed rule defines
``injury'' to incorporate these concepts. The damage assessment process as under the proposed rule is designed to:
determine if there is an injury to a natural resource (Injury Determination), and subsequently quantify the extent
of those injuries (Injury Quantification). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OPA proposed rule defines ``injury'' as ``any adverse change in a natural resource or impairment of a service provided
by a resource.'' While measurement is not required for Injury Determination, it is usually needed for Injury Quantification.
It is necessary to quantify the injury to provide the basis for restoration and determine the extent or amount of damages.
Injury Quantification also may be relevant in establishing that the natural resource injuries resulted from or were
caused by the incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the definition under the proposed rule, ``injury'' under the CERCLA regulations is generally defined
as ``a measurable adverse change, either long- or short-term, in the chemical or physical quality or the viability
of a natural resource resulting either directly or indirectly from exposure to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous
substance, or exposure to a product of reactions resulting from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.''
The CERCLA regulations provide specific injury definitions for various categories of natural resources in the Injury
Determination Phase.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OPA proposed rule specifies that an injury resulting from the incident is demonstrated in the case of direct exposure,
if: (a) the natural resource was exposed, (b) there is a pathway between the discharge and exposed natural resource,
and (c) the exposure of oil, its components, or by-products have been shown by rigorous and appropriate scientific
methodology to have an adverse effect on the natural resource in laboratory experiments or the field. In the absence
of direct exposure, an injury resulting from the incident is demonstrated if: (a) the adverse effect on or impaired/diminished
use of a natural resource has been shown by rigorous and appropriate scientific methodology; and (b) the adverse effect
on or impaired/diminished use of the natural resource would not have occurred but for the discharge or threat of a discharge.
This definition differs from the corresponding definition under the CERCLA rule (43 CFR 11.62(b)-(f)), but this
difference should not produce inconsistencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA is developing guidance on the types of adverse effects that are associated with discharges of oil in a technical
support document for Injury Determination and Quantification. Generally, when attempting to determine whether
there is an injury, quantify that injury, and evaluate whether the injury is a type of injury associated with the discharge
of oil, the trustee should identify those adverse effects that meet certain ``acceptance criteria.'' Factors that
are relevant in choosing a methodology to use to demonstrate adverse effect include the extent to which that methodology
has been able to demonstrate adverse effect in the laboratory or field, and the scientific appropriateness of that
methodology.

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The discussions at the regional workshops and the Washington, D.C. meeting focused on whether trustees should be
required to ``measure'' an adverse change in order to show injury under OPA. NOAA presenters discussed the distinction
between establishing ``liability'' under OPA and proving ``damages.'' Participants indicated that the proposed
rule should explain the distinction better than it does now. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue of concern to many participants was the perception that some biological effects or responses to exposure
to oil are produced in the laboratory but are not reflected in field studies. There was some criticism that the proposed
rule allowed unobserved biological responses to be characterized as ``injury'' to natural resources and that this
amounted to assessing damages for a ``risk of injury'' rather than actual injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that OPA required the injury to be of the type that required restoration or be relevant to restoration
before damages would be owed a trustee. This commenter suggested that adverse effects on natural resources were not
enough by themselves, that the adverse effects had to require restoration in order to constitute injury under OPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One participant argued that OPA is a civil damages statute imposing tort liability and therefore requires a demonstration
of injury-in-fact on-site to result in damages. It was also suggested that the proposed rule presumed injury if a discharge
of oil occurs and that NOAA has no statutory authority for such a presumption.

Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does NOAA's proposed definition of ``injury'' reflect the general understanding of the term in the scientific
and legal community? Should NOAA define ``adverse change?'' If yes, how? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does NOAA's proposed definition of ``injury'' presume injury or must the trustee present evidence of ``injury''
for purposes of establishing damages under OPA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. NOAA's proposed rule includes a definition of the phrase ``injury resulting from a discharge of oil'' (see 59 Fed.
Reg. 1169). OPA section 1002 provides that liability is for removal costs and damages ``that result from such incident.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Does NOAA's proposed definition of ``injury resulting from a discharge'' mingle the concepts of ``injury'' with
``causation?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the proposed definition mingle concepts of legal causation with scientific premises for establishing cause-in-fact?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Should NOAA provide a regulatory definition of ``injury resulting from...such incident...''? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Should NOAA limit its regulatory approach to describing acceptable ways trustee and responsible parties may develop
evidence of injury ``resulting from'' an incident; i.e.''acceptance criteria?''

4. NOAA has suggested that where multiple factors may have contributed to the injury, the injury be viewed as ``resulting
from'' the discharge or incident if the discharge, or incident was a factor contributing to the injury. Should this
view of the ``contributing factor'' test be included in either ``acceptance criteria'' or a definition of ``injury''
or some other appropriate place in the regulations?

Compensation Formulas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is designed to provide a new simple and cost-effective damage assessment procedure for small discharges_compensation
formulas for both estuarine/marine and inland waters. The proposed compensation formulas would be applicable to
the vast majority of oil discharges and for a wide range of the most commonly discharged oil products. An analysis of
reported coastal discharges of oil shows that 99.8% of the discharges were less than 50,000 gallons and 99% were less
than 10,000 gallons. Compensation formulas would be used for most of these relatively small discharges. These formulas
provide an estimate of damages per gallon taking into account average restoration costs, plus average lost direct
use values pending restoration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For various reasons, passive use values are not included in these formulas at this time. The damages calculated with
the formulas vary with the amount and type of oil discharged and region and habitat type in which the discharge occurs.
This approach allows both national consistency and regional specificity. By comparing the habitat of the actual
discharge with the geographical province and specific habitat used to estimate the damages in the formula, the trustee
should, in most cases, find the most applicable scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The simplified damage assessment procedures produce calculations based on statistical averages and are designed
to reasonably reflect the damages of the actual injury in a timely and economical manner. However, any time a simplified
assessment is used, it is unlikely that the exact circumstances of an actual discharge will be represented. Although
the damage calculation is designed to be correct on average, in some cases, the formula will over-state or under-state
the damages. In cases where the circumstances of an actual discharge are determined to be well beyond the parameters
of the compensation formula, the trustee should consider the use of another assessment procedure.

Summary of Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was a wide range of comment on NOAA's proposed use of the compensation formulas for spills of less than 50,000
gallons. The comments ranged from NOAA's lack of statutory authority to use such formulas to the notion that the compensation
formulas are a ``black box used to club the RP'' into settlement. Other participants focused on the predictability
the compensation formulas will bring to the process of assessing smaller spills and the cost effectiveness of using
the formulas for locations where access is difficult. One participant noted that it was unreasonable for NOAA to rely
on formulaic averages when the state of science is insufficient to develop predictive models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several suggestions were made at the workshops. It was recommended that NOAA provide guidance or criteria for proceeding
from pre-assessment to the assessment phase, as well as guidance for the use of the compensation formulas. In particular,
it was suggested that NOAA provide guidance on when the formula should be used and when the Type A model should be used,
as sometimes the Type A model resulted in lower damages than the formulas. It was also suggested that NOAA develop a
set of appropriate, ``off-the-shelf'' studies for the trustees to use in small spills to confirm actual injury. One
commenter stated that the formulas resulted in extraordinarily high per gallon damage figures for certain hypothetical
spills. It was suggested that these worst case scenarios were damaging NOAA's credibility and would affect industry's
view of the simplified procedures generally. To address this problem, the commenter recommended NOAA develop a ceiling
or cap for dollars per gallon spilled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions were received as to how the various state formulas and NOAA's proposed formulas would compare or work together,
and what to do when a complex assessment results in lower damages than the formulas or the Type A model. Lastly, some
comments and questions were posed as to when and how the compensation formulas could be attacked in litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed compensation formulas are based upon various representative province/habitat combinations. Since
the compensation formulas are based upon averages, it is impossible to include all known coastal habitats and every
combination of discharges. By comparing the habitat of the actual discharge with the province and specific habitat
used to estimate the damages in the formula, the trustee should, in most cases, find the most applicable scenario.
However, any time a simplified assessment is used, the exact circumstances of an actual discharge will only be approximated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there is no direct statutory language calling for this form of assessment procedure, NOAA recognized the
need for such a procedure. NOAA emphasizes that the primary advantages of a compensation formula are simplicity and
cost-effectiveness. Are the values of simplicity and cost-effectiveness in the compensation formulas outweighed
by their inherent technical limitations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The compensation formulas were developed after extensive review of the scientific and economic literature, with
particular emphasis on restoration of various habitat types. This information was then compiled to be used with both
the current Type A model for Coastal and Marine Environments and a draft version of the Type A model under development
for the Great Lakes Environments, which provide the basis for the compensation formulas. Was this procedure for developing
the formulas appropriate and reasonable?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Because NOAA's proposed rule may be published as a final rule before the Department of the Interior (DOI) publishes
the two Type A models as final rules, NOAA is seeking comment on three options: (1) Publish the formulas as final rules,
with the option to revise once the DOI Type A models are promulgated as final rules; (2) publish the formulas as interim
final rules, pending revision based upon the completion of the Type A models; or (3) reserve the formulas as proposed
rules pending the completion of the Type A models, with the rest of the NOAA rule being published as a final rule; or (4)
repropose each formula after the model upon which it is based is published as a proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. NOAA is proposing that the damages generated by the compensation formulas be conclusive in nature for those resources
and/or services covered by the formulas. That is, once the rule becomes final and survives any judicial review, parties
may challenge the information used in applying the formulas in a particular assessment or the appropriateness of
using the formula for a specific incident, but may not challenge the underlying algorithms and data used in developing
the formulas. NOAA is specifically seeking comment on this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Passive use (nonuse) values are not included in the formulas at this time, since NOAA determined that sufficient
information does not currently exist concerning average passive use values applicable to the compensation formula
approach. NOAA decided to propose the formulas without passive use values so that they would be available for trustee
use rather than delay proposing to a future date. The trustee, of course, may use some other assessment method to estimate
lost passive values. NOAA specifically requests comments on how such passive values might be included in the compensation
formulas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several simplified natural resource damage assessment schemes have been developed by State trustees over the
last few years to estimate damages to natural resources resulting from discharges of oil. How may any inconsistencies
among the various State assessment methods and NOAA's proposed rule be addressed through NOAA's rulemaking?

Regional Restoration Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1006(f) of OPA requires that sums recovered as damages be used to develop and implement a plan for the restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the injured natural resources. The proposed rule allows the trustees
either to develop an Incident-Specific Restoration Plan to address the effects of the incident of concern, or to pool
recoveries to apply them to a Regional Restoration Plan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regional plans could be developed on a geographical or ecosystem basis to allow the recovery of the system covered
by the plan. Where such a plan already exists (i.e., National Estuary Program (NEP), established by Congress in 1987;
includes 21 estuaries), whether developed through prespill planning efforts or under regular management efforts,
that plan may be used if it is developed through a public review and comment process that considers the major factors
contained in the restoration planning guidance in the rule. The restoration action must address similar or comparable
resource injuries as those identified in the assessment procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In NOAA's view, there are a number of benefits to aggregating recovered monies in a regional restoration plan. First,
it is not cost-effective for trustees to attempt to restore natural resources affected by oil if those restored resources
are still going to be at risk from other pollutant sources that trustees have no authority to address. This problem
is less likely to arise when a regional restoration plan is used because regional plans are more likely to include a
wide range of federal, state, and local enforcement authorities to address pollutant sources (i.e., point and nonpoint
sources) affecting the region in question. Second, the trustees could also benefit from information gathered by
the regional planning process conducted by other agencies (i.e., EPA's Comprehensive Conservation and Management
Plans developed under the NEP) in efficiently and effectively addressing injured resources. Third, where a coordinated
structure involving both public and private parties already exists, it is prudent to take advantage of that structure
for public review of trustee restoration plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments centered on the accountability of trustees for monies in a regional restoration pool and protections necessary
to prevent monies intended for restoration from being used for other purposes. In general, there was suspicion that
the regional restoration funds would be siphoned off for non-restoration-related purposes or for research projects
related to natural resource damage assessment. One commenter stated that NOAA has no statutory authority for pooling
recoveries and that each recovery must be spent for the restoration of resources injured by a particular incident.
One suggestion received was that pooled recoveries be permitted only on a consensual basis with each responsible
party. Another suggestion was that a time limit be imposed on trustees for the expenditure of pooled restoration monies.

Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Is it likely that these regional plans would be useful in areas with long-term pollution effects, where damages
from a single incident would be too small to ``restore'' the injured natural resources or where the planning costs
for the restoration after a single incident would be quite high compared to the damage figure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is pooling of funds contrary to the principles of restitution or compensatory damages? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the use of such regional plans contradict section 1006(f) that ``there be a nexus between monies recovered
resulting from a particular spill and their use to restore or enhance the specific resources `affected by a discharge.'''?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. May some percentage of the ``pooled'' funds be used to pay for the planning costs to develop such plans, since the
estimated restoration costs from the underlying incidents do include planning costs?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1006(c) of OPA requires federal, state, tribal and foreign trustees to ``develop and implement a plan for
the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement or acquisition of the equivalent, of the natural resources under
their trusteeship.'' 33 U.S.C. 1006 (c)(1),(2),(3), and (4). In addition, OPA provides that such ``[p]lans shall

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis added). In NOAA's view, OPA requires restoration planning to proceed like any other federal statutorily-mandated
planning activity_in the sunshine, subject to review under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and in compliance
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and other applicable federal
laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To fulfill the trustee obligations for restoration planning NOAA has proposed a process for the development of an
administrative record documenting all aspects of an incident relevant to the trustee obligation to restore, rehabilitate,
replace, or acquire the equivalent natural resources. In NOAA's view an administrative record for injury assessment
and selection of restoration alternatives achieves four important objectives: (1) It provides a central repository,
open to the public, for all scientific data relevant to the incident; (2) it facilitates public participation; (3)
it documents trustee decisionmaking and selection among alternatives to restore, replace or acquire the equivalent;
and (4) it minimizes transaction costs by encouraging an open, participatory process for the ultimate resolution
(i.e. restoration of natural resources) of an incident rather than resolution through litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's attempt to minimize transaction costs and discourage complex litigation and other activities not leading
to restoration of natural resources is born of the unsatisfactory experience of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
oil spill. In that incident all parties were criticized by the public for maintaining the confidentiality of scientific
studies, conducting science for purpose of litigation, and then settling the case without providing for the release
of the scientific data gathered. It is generally accepted that such a process does not serve the resources, the public,
or the responsible party well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's proposed rule seeks to address these problems by providing for a contemporaneous public repository of scientific
data for injury assessment and restoration activities. As presently proposed, the administrative record documents
trustee decisionmaking processes for injury assessment, selection of restoration activities, the trustee costs,
and anticipated costs of restoration, and may include the economic valuation of injury resulting from the incident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an open record process, subject to the opportunity for public hearing and comment, NOAA intends the trustee's selection
of restoration activities, and their costs, to be available for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure
Act. The standard for judicial review under the APA in an informal rulemaking context is whether the actions of the
trustee were ``arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has taken the position that NEPA should be implemented during the restoration planning process and integrated
into the development of the Draft Assessment Restoration Plan (DARP). It is NOAA's view that those procedures normally
contemplated as part of the DARP can be framed and addressed as NEPA analysis and full NEPA compliance achieved without
additional paperwork or data collection. A concise analysis of available restoration alternatives and the consequences
of their implementation in the post-spill environment should form the heart of the DARP document as well as any NEPA
document with which it may be combined.

Public comment on the proposed DARP was varied. Some commenters suggested NOAA prepare a guidance document with a
standardized format and criteria for information to be included in the record. Another participant suggested that
NOAA refer to the EPA guidance for preparation of an administrative record. Commenters felt that organization and
cross-referencing mechanisms were important if the record was to be useful to people in the field.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters discussed the importance of including all available data and the QA/QC criteria in the record.
It was often stated that from the scientist's point of view, there is no reason not to put all data in the record as long
as it is accompanied by sound study design, appropriate sampling and QA/QC protocols and a description of the level
of review. Another commenter suggested that a standing peer review committee should review data before it is entered
in the record. One participant asked whether or how the record could contain useful information or documents that
do not meet pure chain of custody requirements. There was some concern raised about parties ``stuffing'' or ``dumping''
material in the record to force the other party to respond or overwhelm the other party. Another concern raised was
that the proposed rule does not require the trustee to invite responsible party participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants stated that the proposed administrative record process would promote litigation rather than
reduce transaction costs. There was a strong feeling on the part of some commenters that NOAA's position that the administrative
record would receive judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act using the standard of ``arbitrary and
capricious'' was fundamentally unfair to the responsible party and a violation of due process. Several commenters
felt the trustees had too much flexibility and too much control over the contents of the record. Some commenters felt
the responsible party was entitled to challenge the trustee's decisions on a ``preponderance of the evidence'' before
a jury. Another commenter suggested NOAA set up an adjudicative process where an administrative law judge would preside
and apply the ``substantial evidence'' standard to the trustee's record and allow extra-record evidence to be produced
at an administrative trial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally it was suggested that federal trustees need not comply with NEPA because the DARP would qualify under the ``functional
equivalency'' doctrine. Another commenter queried whether the responsible party would have to bear the costs of
NEPA compliance.

Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Should trustee decisionmaking on the record include all aspects of injury assessment and restoration/replacement
activities including financial costs and economic valuation or should the trustee decisions on the record include
only the injury assessment and restoration/replacement activities excluding a determination of costs and economic
values as aspects of money damages suitable for de novo trial along with liability? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is a ``bifurcated'' review process practical, i.e. will an administrative record review for injury assessment
and restoration selection and a separate litigation-driven process for determination of liability and money damages
prove workable or raise significant timing issues and evidentiary problems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Is a trial appropriate for determination of liability and/or money damages under OPA? Is a trial appropriate for
review or litigation of trustee's decisions during injury assessment and selection of restoration activities?
If yes, should such a trial be to the court or to the jury? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Is the administrative record process for developing the trustee's assessment and/or restoration alternatives
``informal rulemaking'' or ``quasi-adjudicative'' under the APA? How would an administrative record prepared
by a state trustee be reviewed by a state court? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should there be a means for preventing any one party from ``stuffing'' the administrative record to achieve a preponderance
of evidence or strain the ability of other parties to respond on the record? If so, what should it be? Should there be
designated times for the submission of materials to the record? Should the rule define the types of data, analysis
and other documents submitted to the record? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. How should the trustee comply with section 1006(c)(5) of OPA [restoration plans developed and implemented only
after adequate public notice, opportunity for hearing and comment] in the context of settlement? Specifically,
what type of process would satisfy the potential desire to settle an OPA claim with specific performance of a restoration
activity as well as comply with section 1006(c)(5) and NEPA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The rule as currently proposed requires public review only when the trustee releases the Draft Assessment and Restoration
Plan. Should there be additional requirements for public review or participation? Should the requirements vary
according to the type of assessment chosen by the trustee?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Does NEPA apply to the trustee's selection of restoration alternatives? At what point is restoration planning
a ``major federal action'' or ``irretrievable commitment of resources'' for purposes of NEPA compliance? Is it appropriate
to postpone NEPA compliance until the trustee has received the money damages? Is it practical to combine NEPA compliance
with the development of the DARP? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If an administrative adjudication process conducted by an administrative law judge were set up for the review of
the administrative record and the trustee's demand for damages, would transaction costs be reduced from the present
system? Would the trustees be forced into a disadvantage by providing all of their data and basis for decisionmaking
on the record while the responsible party waited until the administrative trial to attack the record with expert witnesses
and extra-record evidence? Who would bear the costs of setting up and operating administrative adjudication system?
Would state or tribal trustees be required to use such a system?

Much attention has been given to valuing damages to natural resources. This attention has been directed, for the most
part, at the controversial economic valuation method of contingent valuation. However, given the expense and time
associated with designing and implementing site-specific studies, such as contingent valuation, natural resource
trustees have turned to alternative methods for the majority of oil spill damage assessments. Two alternative methods
have been included in the natural resource damage assessment regulations promulgated pursuant to the OPA: 1) the
benefits transfer method and 2) the habitat or species replacement cost method. These alternatives allow the trustee
to estimate compensable values or estimate damages for interim lost services at a lower cost than with site-specific
studies. A third alternative may also be considered that would involve government expenditures on a resource as a
lower bound for the ``value'' of that resource. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Benefits Transfer: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefits transfer method uses existing estimates of use values or of valuation functions that were developed
in one context to address a similar resource valuation question in a different context. Where resource values exist
that have been developed through an administrative or legislative process, or where other values are appropriate,
use of these values may allow a less time-consuming and less expensive damage estimation than original valuation
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Habitat or Species Replacement Cost: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The habitat or species replacement cost method may be used to estimate damages for lost services from the injured habitats
and/or biological resources, when human services provided by the habitat or species are difficult to quantify. This
method involves estimating damages in terms of the cost of obtaining from alternative services the equivalent of
the resource and/or services. In order to ensure that the scale of the compensatory restoration or replacement project(s)
on which the cost calculation is based does not over- or under-compensate the public for injuries incurred, the proposed
OPA rule suggests that the trustee must establish an equivalency between the present discounted value (PDV) of the
quantity of lost services and the PDV of the quantity of services provided by the replacement project(s) over time.

Contingent Valuation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA's proposed rule allows the use of contingent valuation (CV) to produce assessments of interim lost value, including
lost passive use value, based on its preliminary finding that such methodology is reliable enough for use in a judicial
or administrative determination of natural resource damages. To achieve the reliability necessary for this purpose,
however, NOAA has proposed a set of requirements to which the studies must adhere. This proposal was based on the guidance
provided by the report of the NOAA Blue Ribbon Panel on Contingent Valuation (chaired by Professors Kenneth Arrow
and Robert Solow) as well as other comments submitted to NOAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA worked closely with The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) in drafting and refining the contingent valuation
(CV) language for the rule and in outlining the scope of a possible CV guidance document. DOI and NOAA agreed to propose
similar language for both the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and
Oil Pollution Act (OPA) rules, thereby providing consistent approaches to CV in the two regulatory schemes.

Comment Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the economic methods for computing compensable values generally took the form of question or dialogue.
There was some dialogue among members of the public and NOAA presenters concerning the appropriateness of including
contingent valuation as a method for estimating nonuse or ``passive'' values. One commenter queried whether trustees
could do inexpensive contingent valuation surveys for smaller spills. Another participant wondered how the trustees
would respond to a situation where a contingent valuation study used to measure total compensable value resulted
in damages less than necessary for restoration. Conversely, the commenter queried how the rule would guide the trustee
for whom a contingent valuation survey resulted in total compensable values of 100 million dollars when habitat replacement
would result in damages of 100 thousand dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat replacement was the subject of significant interest as commenters inquired whether it was a compensable
values methodology or a restoration methodology. One commenter recommended NOAA provide a more clear explanation
of the habitat replacement method in the rule and distinguish between habitat replacement and acquisition of the
equivalent. In addition, it was suggested that NOAA clearly identify the possible double counting issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested better guidance be made available on the ``benefits transfer'' methodology. Of particular
concern was the situation where baseline studies failed to be reliable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the question of whether trustees should apply ``offsets'' when calculating damages was a topic of extensive
discussion. Several commenters felt that in some circumstances a discharge of oil will cause an improvement in conditions
for some natural resources or increase the services of other natural resources. These commenters felt that the responsible
party should receive a positive offset against the injury to other natural resources or loss of their services. The
``offset'' concept was viewed by some commenters as particularly appropriate for direct uses vis a vis passive uses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. What should be the role, if any, of the requirements for site-specific CV studies measuring passive use value in
determining whether the quality of a CV study is adequate for use in benefits transfer? How would the extent of the market
be determined for benefits transfer using CV studies? Should the conditions be different for valuing direct use losses
and for valuing passive use losses? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Government expenditures (per unit of services injured) have been suggested as a proxy for the value of those services
lost as a result of an incident. Should the OPA rule suggest that government expenditures may be used as a proxy for the
value of a resource? Under what circumstances would use of this method be appropriate? For example, should the trustee
be directed to consider whether the following two conditions be met in determining appropriateness of the method:
changes in the quality/quantity of the injured resources can be related to the (change in) level of government expenditures;
the government programs for which expenditures have been accounted are the major cause of the changes in the quality/quantity
of the affected resource? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed OPA rule specifies that the trustee is to use the U.S. Treasury rate to discount for all three categories
of damages: restoration costs, interim lost value, and damage assessment costs. Following the guidance in OMB Circular
A&hyph;94 (for cost-effectiveness analysis and for federal leasing), nominal interest rates are to be used with
damages in nominal terms (for example, past costs) and real rates (with an adjustment based on the Administration's
prediction for future inflation published in the President's budget) are to be used for damages in real terms. ``Nominal
terms'' refers to calculations expressed in the dollars of the year in which the damages accrued; ``real terms'' refers
to damages expressed in dollars of a base year (such as the year in which the claim is presented). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For restoration costs, what if the return on accounts available to the trustee(s) for placement of recovered funds
is lower than the U.S. Treasury rate, so that the present discounted value of future restoration costs will not support
the full restoration project? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed OPA rule provides that the trustee must document the method used to calibrate hypothetical willingness
to pay to actual willingness to pay. In the absence of such documentation, the trustee must divide by two. This calibration
procedure is to ``correct'' for the combined effects of two countervailing potential biases: the mandated elicitation
of willingness to pay (WTP) measures may understate the correct measure of damages [willingness to accept], whereas
the elicitation of hypothetical WTP in contingent valuation studies may overstate ``true'' WTP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Is calibration appropriate? If so, is the proposed default calibration factor appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. On what basis could ``calibration'' factors be developed for individual cases? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If reliable calibration of hypothetical to actual WTP is not feasible, would it be reasonable to rely on unadjusted
WTP results of CV studies as a valid measure of nonuse values/use values? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The proposed OPA rule states that two independent ``scope'' tests are to be conducted, showing significant changes
in respondents' WTP in response to variations in the scope of injuries (from the injury scenario to be proved in the
case), unless the trustee(s) can show creation of two alternate scenarios to the base case is infeasible due to considerations
of cost or lack of plausibility of scenarios. The tests are to be conducted with an additional sample for each additional
scenario, (a ``split sample'' test). Procedures are outlined for limiting the differences in scope between the base
case and alternative scenarios.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. How many sensitivity to ``scope of injury'' tests are appropriate to require? Are restrictions on differences
between scenarios appropriate or feasible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Is it appropriate to allow the trustee(s) to conduct the scope test with the base survey instrument, by constructing
a valuation function to examine whether variations in belief about injuries predict variations in WTP, controlling
for demographic and attitudinal factors? Are there additional/alternative internal validity test(s) that NOAA
should consider? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 70% is the minimum allowable response rate contained in the proposed OPA rule. In order to minimize non-response
bias, should a minimum response rate be specified? If so, is 70% the appropriate level? If 70% is not the appropriate
rate, what rationale is there for a different rate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In the proposed OPA rule, the trustee(s) is directed to use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive-compatible,
i.e., one that does not provide respondents with incentives to understate or overstate their true value. The reasons
are outlined in the preamble for recommending the use of a referendum as the choice mechanism in a survey. Are these
requirements appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should respondents with no knowledge of the resources and/or injuries prior to survey be assigned a zero value?
What is the appropriate use of data on respondents' prior information? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Should there be thresholds for damages, below which CV could not be used in a damage assessment, e.g., an expected
$5/household times the number of households expected to hold passive values; and/or twice the cost of a contingent
valuation survey following these regulations. What threshold, if any, is appropriate? How would the threshold be
implemented (without performing a CV study? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In the proposed rule, the trustee(s) has the option of choosing the mode of administration of a survey, but the choice
must be justified. Is one mode, e.g., in-person, telephone, or mail, preferable to another? If so, or if not, what rationale
supports it? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Should the rule or preamble provide guidance as to criteria to be employed in determining the extent of the market?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on CV studies for valuing direct use only? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on contingent behavior studies?

 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is publishing for comment proposed amendments to the financial
responsibility rules in Part 402 and a conforming amendment to a recordkeeping requirement in Part 404 of the regulations
issued under the Government Securities Act of 1986 (``GSA''). The proposed amendments would raise the minimum capital
requirements for all government securities brokers and dealers subject to the requirements of Section 402.2 and
establish a written notification requirement for certain withdrawals of capital. The proposed amendments parallel
the Securities and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') final and proposed amendments to the minimum net capital requirements
for brokers and dealers subject to the requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1 (Rule 15c3&hyph;1) and final rules
regarding the withdrawal of capital.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing amendments to its financial responsibility rules in Part 402 that would raise the minimum
capital requirements and establish written notification requirements for certain capital withdrawals for those
government securities brokers and dealers subject to the provisions of &sect;402.2. Additionally, the Department
is proposing a conforming change to the recordkeeping requirements of Part 404 which is necessitated by the proposals
to revise the minimum capital levels. The Department believes that these proposed amendments will enhance the capital
adequacy of government securities brokers and dealers and provide for more effective regulatory oversight. These
proposed amendments parallel rule amendments adopted or proposed by the SEC. The Department's amendments, if adopted,
will increase investor confidence in the financial responsibility of government securities brokers and dealers
without creating any substantial new barriers to entry into the government securities market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SEC published proposed revisions to its minimum capital levels in October 1989
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and December 1992
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and to its capital withdrawal rules in August 1990.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The SEC published its final capital withdrawal regulations on March 5, 1991,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 finalized its first change in minimum capital levels on November 24, 1992,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 but has not yet finalized its second proposal on minimum capital levels for certain introducing firms. The Treasury
capital rule
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 uses the SEC capital standard (Rule 15c3&hyph;1)
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 as a foundation and, accordingly, it is useful to strive to minimize the differences between the two rules. Additionally,
it is Treasury's objective to maintain consistency with the SEC rule and, ultimately, have a uniform capital rule
for all government securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC. The Treasury would have acted sooner to
propose these amendments but its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized
until December 17, 1993. (107 Stat. 2344, Pub. L. 103&hyph;202).

Having reviewed the SEC's actions, the Department has determined to propose changes to its capital rule, which, for
the most part, parallel the SEC's modifications. The following text explains the Department's rationale supporting
its amendments, with particular emphasis on the differences between the Department's and the SEC's changes.

A. Minimum Capital Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SEC has either increased or proposed increasing the minimum net capital requirements for most brokers and dealers
subject to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 to an amount ranging up to $250,000, depending on the type of business conducted by the
broker or dealer. The previous minimum requirements had been unchanged for at least 16 years, and, in the case of the
$5,000 level applicable to introducing brokers, for 26 years.

The Department, in developing its existing capital rule, modified the SEC minimum capital levels prior to incorporating
them into the Treasury rule. The modifications reflected the different structure of the Treasury capital requirement
whereby securities haircuts are not deducted but instead act as a benchmark with which liquid capital is compared
in determining capital adequacy. Nonetheless, the minimum dollar capital levels are based on liquid capital after
deducting haircuts, which is comparable to the SEC's calculation of net capital. The Treasury rule currently has
a $5,000 minimum liquid capital requirement for introducing brokers
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and a $25,000 minimum liquid capital requirement for all other government securities brokers and dealers
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 subject to the rule.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 These levels are equivalent to SEC requirements applicable to brokers and dealers operating under the aggregate
indebtedness capital computation prior to the amendments. The Department believes that increasing the minimum
levels is appropriate in order to provide better protection to investors in the event of a government securities broker's
or dealer's insolvency and to reflect the current realities of the government securities market. Accordingly, the
Department is proposing to increase the minimum capital requirements for all government securities brokers and
dealers subject to the provisions of &sect;402.2. The other capital requirement_that liquid capital be at least
equal to 120% of haircuts_would be unaffected by this proposal.

The Treasury capital rule requires that a government securities broker or dealer maintain a capital level of the greater
of (i) 120% of total haircuts; or (ii) the minimum dollar capital amounts, computed by deducting total haircuts from
liquid capital, applicable to its business.

The increases would be effected by creating four minimum capital standards from the two current requirements, reflecting
a better differentiation of the risks related to a government securities broker's or dealer's operations based on
the type of government securities business it conducts. The four proposed minimum capital requirements would be
as follows: (1) government securities brokers and dealers that carry customer or broker-dealer accounts would be
subject to a minimum level of $250,000; (2) government securities brokers and dealers that carry customer accounts
but that operate under the exemption provided by Rule 15c3&hyph;3(k)(2)(i)
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 would have a minimum requirement of $100,000; (3) government securities brokers that introduce accounts on a fully
disclosed basis and receive but do not hold customer securities would be subject to a minimum requirement of $50,000;
and (4) introducing firms that never handle customer funds or securities would be subject to a minimum requirement
of $25,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These changes represent increases from the current minimum levels of between $20,000 and $225,000, depending on
the type of business conducted by the government securities broker or dealer. The Department is proposing fewer levels
than the SEC has proposed since the operations of government securities brokers and dealers do not encompass all the
activities available to diversified brokers or dealers. The proposed Treasury minimum capital requirements adequately
reflect the different levels of custodial risk found in the various types of government securities operations without
creating significant barriers to entry into the government securities market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any increase of capital requirements represents a potential burden on regulated entities and on the market; this
potential effect must be weighed against the resulting benefits. Minimum capital levels provide a cushion which
is available to ease the liquidation or resolution of troubled government securities brokers and dealers. This is
a fundamental element of customer protection. The increases that the Department is proposing are modest relative
to the size and complexity of the government securities market and the operations of government securities brokers
and dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the SEC first proposed increasing broker's and dealer's minimum capital levels, the SEC received comments opposing
the increased requirements. The SEC has also received additional negative comments from introducing firms that
would be affected by the outstanding proposal to increase the minimum net capital level of such brokers. However,
the Department believes that its proposed increases will have a very small impact on the firms, including introducing
brokers, subject to &sect;402.2. An analysis of the government securities brokers and dealers subject to the provisions
of &sect;402.2 indicates that, as of June 30, 1993, only seven, out of a total of 39, would not be in compliance with the
proposed, fully phased-in minimum capital levels. Four of these firms would not be in compliance with the new requirements
for introducing firms, two would be out of compliance with the $100,000 requirement and one would not meet the $250,000
level. The aggregate capital shortfall of these seven firms is less than $200,000, with the largest individual deficit
being less than $50,000. To ease the compliance burden and to provide a period for the affected government securities
brokers and dealers to adjust, the Department is proposing to add an Appendix E to &sect;402.2 which would phase in
the increases over an 18-month time frame from the effective date. This corresponds to the phase in time frames that
were adopted and proposed by the SEC.

14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These rules require written notification to the SEC and the broker's or dealer's designated examining authority
of certain capital withdrawals; add a restriction on the withdrawal of capital based on the ratio of net capital to
securities haircuts; provide additional definitions; and permit the SEC, by order, to prohibit the withdrawal of
capital in certain described circumstances. The Department is proposing to amend its capital withdrawal provisions

The notification provisions would require post-withdrawal notification of certain significant capital withdrawals
as well as prior notification for larger withdrawals. Whether the notification would be required prior to the withdrawal
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 would be determined by the aggregate size of total withdrawals relative to the government securities broker's or
dealer's excess liquid capital
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 over a 30 calendar day period. Once aggregate withdrawals have exceeded 20 percent of a government securities broker's
or dealer's excess liquid capital in a 30 calendar day period, the government securities broker or dealer will have
two business days thereafter in which to file notification of the withdrawals. Aggregate withdrawals in excess of
30 percent of excess liquid capital in any 30 calendar day period would require notification two business days prior
to such withdrawal. A government securities broker or dealer may use the level of excess liquid capital calculated
in its most recent Form G&hyph;405, ``Report on Finances and Operations of Government Securities Brokers and Dealers
(FOGS)'' filing,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provided the firm assures itself that this amount has not materially changed since that time. A government securities
broker or dealer is not required under the proposed rule to provide notice to the Department, but instead notice would
be sent to the SEC and to the broker's or dealer's designated examining authority.

The proposed rule would exclude the reporting of net withdrawals that, in the aggregate, are less than $500,000 in
any 30 calendar day period or those that represent securities or commodities transactions between affiliates. The
exclusion for securities and commodities transactions requires that the transactions be conducted in the ordinary
course of business and settled no later than two business days after the date of the transaction. Discussions with
SEC staff have indicated that forward settling transactions between affiliates would not be eligible for this exclusion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, net losses on forward contracts or net payments on swap agreements, if due an affiliate, could trigger
the notice requirement. The Department specifically requests comment as to whether this exclusion should be broadened
and if so how. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only material difference between the notification rules as promulgated by the SEC and as proposed by the Department
is that the SEC's rules use excess net capital, whereas the Department's rule uses excess liquid capital. This variance
conforms to the different measurement standards used under each rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that knowledge of significant capital movements is an essential part of ensuring capital
adequacy and financial responsibility. The SEC's experience with the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the National Association of Securities Dealer's experience with Drexel Burnham Lambert GSI making substantial
amounts of inadequately secured loans to its holding company indicate the importance of prompt and accurate knowledge
of the movement of capital.

The Department does not plan to amend the current restrictions on the withdrawal of capital to reflect the SEC's adoption
of a new early warning threshold derived from securities haircuts. It has been the Department's belief, in establishing
its capital standard, that a capital cushion related to a firm's securities position risk is a prudent approach to
determining capital adequacy. The Treasury rule currently places a restriction on any capital withdrawals that
would cause a government securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital to fall below a level of 150% of haircuts.
This standard is analogous to the recently-adopted SEC requirement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The third element of the SEC's capital withdrawal rule is a provision giving the SEC authority to prohibit a withdrawal
of capital by a broker or dealer, for up to 20 business days, if the withdrawal would exceed 30% of excess net capital
and is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker or dealer or may unduly jeopardize the broker's
or dealer's ability to repay its creditors.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The SEC intends that this provision be used in emergency situations and the rule provides for an expeditious review
of the SEC's action. For the reasons that follow, the Department has determined that a similar provision should not
be incorporated in the Treasury capital rule.

First, while the SEC has an existing process for holding hearings, the Department has no comparable structure and
therefore the implementation of the post-order process would require the Department to develop additional administrative
regulations and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department's decision not to enact a corresponding order provision is based on the fact that the SEC
has existing temporary cease and desist authority. The SEC was granted this authority prusuant to the Securities
Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;429), Section 203 of which added Section
21C to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Paragraph (c) of Section 21C provides the SEC with authority to issue a temporary cease and desist order in the event
``that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in the notice *&blank;*&blank;* is likely to result
in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public
interest,*&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A temporary cease and desist order, while different from a capital withdrawal order, serves a similar purpose. Both
are emergency remedies that can be expeditiously applied. Prior to issuing a temporary cease and desist order, the
SEC must provide notice and opportunity for a hearing unless the SEC ``*&blank;*&blank;* determines that notice
and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest.''

The more limited scope of the temporary cease and desist order is not problematic to the Department because the authority
provides the SEC with the ability to issue such an order not only if a rule violation has occurred but also if one is threatened.
Since the SEC is the appropriate regulatory agency for government securities brokers or dealers subject to &sect;402.2,
an impending violation of a &sect;402.2 requirement would be cause for the issuance of a temporary cease and desist
order. The SEC would still be able to anticipate sizeable capital withdrawals that might result in violations of &sect;402.2,
since it would receive the notifications required by the proposed rule, as described earlier. The SEC would only be
prevented from issuing a temporary cease and desist order in the circumstance where a government securities broker
or dealer would remain in capital compliance and would not breach the rule's early warning levels as a result of the
withdrawal. Assuming the adequacy of the current capital standards and withdrawal restrictions, it is difficult
to foresee a circumstance in which issuance of a capital withdrawal order would be desirable when a government securities
broker or dealer would continue to remain in capital compliance. For these reasons, the Department believes that,
in lieu of developing a separate capital withdrawal order provision, it should rely on the SEC's existing cease and
desist order authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with this approach, the Department also is excluding this provision of Rule 15c3&hyph;1 from the compliance
requirements for those government securities brokers and dealers registered under Section 15C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;5) that are subject to the SEC capital rule (i.e., interdealer brokers operating
under &sect;402.1(e) and futures commission merchants). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In amending the withdrawal provisions, the Department has restructured certain related definitions of terms into
a Miscellaneous Provisions paragraph (i)(3) and has added a description of what constitutes an advance or loan of
liquid capital, which is one component of the restricted activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Conforming Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the revisions of the minimum capital requirements under both the SEC and Treasury capital rules, a conforming
change is required in the recordkeeping provisions of Part 404. Specifically, paragraph 404.2(a)(4) contains references
to the minimum dollar capital amounts required of government securities clearing brokers and dealers. The Department
is proposing to revise these references in accordance with the proposed fully phased-in minimum capital level of
$250,000 required of clearing firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed regulations
are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is hereby certified that the proposed regulations, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. As of June 30, 1993, only 39 government securities brokers and dealers were
subject to the capital requirements of &sect;402.2. Of these, only 11 firms would be considered small entities. Accordingly,
the relatively low dollar value of the proposed capital increase and the small number of firms affected indicates
that there is not a significant impact. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed
rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. In accordance with this requirement,
the Department has submitted the collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking for review.
Comments on the collection of information should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20503;
and to the Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt, at the address specified at the beginning
of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collections of information in this proposed rule are contained in proposed &sect;402.2(i)(1). This paragraph
would require a government securities broker or dealer, subject to the requirements of &sect;402.2, to provide written
notification of certain specified withdrawals of capital. This collection of information is intended to allow the
SEC and the designated examining authority of the firm to better monitor the government securities broker's or dealer's
operations and financial condition. The rule applies primarily to larger government securities brokers and dealers
since aggregate withdrawals of less than $500,000 are excluded from the requirement.

broker or dealer may use the amount of excess liquid capital, liquid capital and total haircuts reported in its most
recently required filed Form G&hyph;405 for the purposes of calculating the effect of a projected withdrawal, advance
or loan relative to excess liquid capital or total haircuts. The government securities broker or dealer must assure

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The term equity capital includes capital contributions by partners, par or stated value of capital stock, paid-in
capital in excess of par, retained earnings or other capital accounts. The term equity capital does not include securities

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes amendments to regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to constructive distributions on preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations concern the treatment of stock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeemable at a premium by the issuer. Under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, a call premium is generally treated as giving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rise to a constructive distribution only if redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the call provision is more likely than not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur. The proposed amendments to the regulations also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect 1990 amendments to section 305(c) of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code.

Management and Budget for review in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of information should be sent to the Office

of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information is in &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(5). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is required to notify the IRS that the issuer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and holder of stock subject to section 305 have made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent determinations as to whether there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructive distribution under &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b). The likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents are individuals or households and business or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other for-profit institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated total annual reporting burden: 333 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes to 15 minutes, depending on individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, with an estimated average of 10 minutes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated number of respondents: 2000. Estimated annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of responses: one.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes amendments to the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 305 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 305(a) provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross income generally does not include stock dividends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(b)(4) provides an exception for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributions with respect to preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(c) provides that, under regulations, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between redemption price and issue price, or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction having a similar effect, shall be treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. This provision addresses methods ``devised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give preferred stockholders the equivalent of dividends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock which are not taxable as such under present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law.'' S. Rep. No. 552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 151 (1969). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, ``a corporation may issue preferred stock for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 per share which pays no dividends, but which may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeemed in 20 years for $200. The effect is the same as if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the corporation distributed preferred stock equal to 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the original stock each year during the 20-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period in lieu of cash dividends.'' Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) provides that if a corporation issues preferred stock which may be redeemed after
a specified period of time at a price higher than the issue price, the difference is considered a distribution of additional
stock on preferred stock which is constructively received by the shareholder over the period of time during which
the preferred stock cannot be called for redemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) provides that this rule does not apply to the extent that the higher redemption
price represents a reasonable redemption premium. A safe harbor is provided under which a redemption premium is considered
reasonable if it is not in excess of 10 percent of the issue price on stock not redeemable for five years from the date
of issuance. A redemption premium that does not meet this safe harbor is considered reasonable if it is in the nature
of a penalty for premature redemption and is not larger than the premiums being paid for this purpose by other issuers
of similar stock at the time of issuance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) can apply to preferred stock that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is redeemable solely at the option of the issuer. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder generally must treat a call premium as a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution under &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b) to the extent that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium is unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(c) was amended by the Revenue Reconciliation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1990 (the 1990 Act), Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, which changed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment of stock redeemable at a premium. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments provide that: (a) If the issuer is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeem stock at a specified time, or the holder has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to require the issuer to redeem stock, at a premium, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the redemption premium will result in a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution if it exceeds a de minimis amount computed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the principles of section 1273(a)(3); (b) a redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium will not fail to be treated as a distribution (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series of distributions) merely because the stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
callable; and (c) in any case where a redemption premium is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a distribution (or series of distributions), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium will be taken into account under principles similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those of section 1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to section 305(c) did not alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that constructive distributions resulting from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption premium be treated as distributions to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 301 applies only if they have the effect described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 305(b), including section 305(b)(4). Rather, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments were adopted because Congress believed that ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic accrual rules applicable to debt instruments issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with [original issue discount (OID)] also should generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to certain preferred stock issued with a redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium if the stock will be redeemed, or if it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably be assumed that the stock will be redeemed, on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed date.'' H.R. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 347 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1990). The legislative history to the 1990 amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that Congress did not intend to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of the Treasury and the IRS to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper treatment of redemption premiums on callable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock. Id. at 348&hyph;49.

1990 Act Amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5 (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restate the basic rules concerning the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatorily redeemable and puttable stock in conformity with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1990 Act. The IRS and Treasury anticipate that other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues raised by the 1990 Act will be addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Treatment of issuer call rights
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The primary focus of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations is on the treatment under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
305(c) of stock callable at a premium at the option of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If stock is subject to an issuer call, the holder cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control whether the stock will be redeemed at the premium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount. Moreover, if the payment of a call premium merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects increases in the value of the holder's stock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from market fluctuations after the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance, the call premium is not the equivalent of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution and its payment is more appropriately taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only upon realization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, on the date of issuance, however, it is more likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than not that an issuer will exercise its call option based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the economic terms of the stock, the holder's anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the earnings and assets of the issuer through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the call premium is equivalent to a periodic return on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock that should be taxed over time as a distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a call has the effect of a mandatory redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, and should produce comparable tax consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(3) requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructive distribution treatment with respect to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuer call only if, based on all of the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances as of the issue date, redemption pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the call right is more likely than not to occur. Even if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption may be likely, however, constructive distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment does not result if the redemption premium is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely in the nature of a penalty for premature redemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A penalty for premature redemption is a premium paid as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of changes in economic or market conditions over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which neither the issuer nor the holder has control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples include changes in prevailing dividend rates or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of the common stock into which the stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convertible. Calls in such cases reflect increases in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the holder's stock resulting from events that occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the date of issuance, and the premiums paid thereon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore represent a penalty for premature redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than the equivalent of a periodic return on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a safe harbor, constructive distribution treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not result from an issuer call if the issuer and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder are unrelated, there are no arrangements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively require the issuer to redeem the stock, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise of the option to redeem would not reduce the yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard in the proposed safe harbor is similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard for taking into account call options in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the yield of debt instruments potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the accrual of OID. See &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the determination of whether a redemption premium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be treated as a constructive distribution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based solely on the effect of an issuer call on yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) does not provide any exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from constructive distribution treatment for stock that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately callable by the issuer. Under proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(3), a constructive distribution by
reason of the issuer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
call would only occur in cases where a call is more likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than not to occur, based on the facts and circumstances as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the issue date. The holder is treated as constructively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving the premium as a distribution over the period from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issue date to the date on or by which redemption is most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, the tax consequences of callable preferred stock are intended to reflect the economic
expectations of the parties and to afford issuers flexibility to issue stock on terms that reflect their business
needs. The proposed regulations are also intended to foreclose corporations from attempting to use issuer calls
to create constructive distributions solely for tax planning reasons. However, no inference is to be drawn from the
proposed regulations as to the appropriate treatment of such call rights under current law. Such provisions are subject
to scrutiny under general tax principles (e.g., substance over form). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
De minimis exception. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) would replace the ``reasonable redemption premium'' exception under current
&sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) with the statutory de minimis rule under section 305(c)(1) for mandatorily redeemable
and puttable stock, and extend the statutory rule to issuer calls. Extending this rule to issuer calls differs from
the treatment discussed in the legislative history of the 1990 Act, but is appropriate because the proposed regulations
limit constructive distribution treatment with respect to issuer calls to circumstances in which the stock is economically
similar to mandatorily redeemable stock. In those cases, the call premium cannot fairly be said to be ``in the nature
of a penalty for premature redemption.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since those cases are outside of the intended scope of the exception in the current regulations, there is no reason
to retain current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) for callable stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conforming changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would conform the examples in &sect;&sect;1.305&hyph;3 and 1.305&hyph;5 to the proposed
changes described above. In addition, the proposed regulations would conform language in &sect;1.305&hyph;7(a)
to the proposed changes described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective dates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(6) contains the effective date rules. In general, the regulations are proposed
to apply to stock issued on or after the date final regulations are filed with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reports to the 1990 Act indicate that Congress did not intend to limit the authority of the Secretary
to promulgate regulations relating to the accrual of redemption premiums on callable preferred stock. However,
the reports indicate that Congress anticipated any such regulations would be prospective. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964,
101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed regulations do not apply to stock issued before the date final regulations are filed with the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the rules of sections 305(c) (1), (2), and (3) apply to stock described therein issued on or after October 10, 1990,
except as provided in section 11322(b)(2) of the 1990 Act. The committee reports to the 1990 Act express Congress'
intention that the economic accrual and OID de minimis rules generally apply as of the effective date of the 1990 Act
without regard to when regulations are amended to reflect such rules. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.
1095 (1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reports note that, in general, the OID de minimis rule will not apply to preferred stock that is callable
solely at the option of the issuer (unless such stock is subject to a mandatory redemption or is puttable). However,
the economic accrual rule will apply as of the effective date of the 1990 Act to the entire call premium on stock that
is callable solely at the option of the issuer (but not mandatorily redeemable or puttable) if such premium is considered
to be unreasonable under the current regulations. In such cases, except as provided in regulations, the entire call
premium will be accrued over the period of time during which the preferred stock cannot be called for redemption. It
should be noted that the committee reports also authorize the Secretary to treat stock that, in form, is merely callable
as being subject to a mandatory redemption or a put if the existence of other arrangements effectively requires the
issuer to redeem the stock. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990).

Special Analyses

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for November 14, 1994, at 10 a.m., in the auditorium. Because of access restrictions,
visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by October 24, 1994, and submit
an outline of the topics (signed original and eight (8) copies) to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic
by October 24, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed.
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing.

Facts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Corporation V is organized with two classes of stock, class A common and class B convertible preferred. The class B
stock is issued for $100 per share and is convertible into class A at a fixed ratio that is not subject to full adjustment
in the event stock dividends or rights are distributed to the class A shareholders. The class B stock pays no dividends
but it is mandatorily redeemable in 10 years for $200. Under sections 305(c) and 305(b)(4), the entire redemption
premium (i.e., the excess of the redemption price over the issue price) is deemed to be a distribution of preferred
stock on preferred stock which is taxable as a distribution of property under section 301. This amount is considered
to be distributed over the 10-year period under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). During the
year, the corporation declares a dividend on the class A stock payable in additional shares of class A stock. (ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The distribution on the class A stock is a distribution to which sections 305(b)(2) and 301 apply since it increases
the proportionate interests of the class A shareholders in the assets and earnings and profits of the corporation
and the class B shareholders have received property (i.e., the constructive distribution described above). If,
however, the conversion ratio of the class B stock were subject to full adjustment to reflect the distribution of stock
to class A shareholders, the distribution of stock dividends on the class A stock would not increase the proportionate
interest of the class A shareholders in the assets and earnings and profits of the corporation and such distribution
would not be a distribution to which section 301 applies.

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a corporation issues preferred stock that may be redeemed under the circumstances described in this paragraph
(b) at a price higher than the issue price, the difference (the redemption premium) is treated under section 305(c)
as a constructive distribution (or series of constructive distributions) of additional stock on preferred stock
that is taken into account under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). However, constructive
distribution treatment does not result under this paragraph if the redemption premium does not exceed a de minimis
amount, as determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3).

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section applies to stock by reason of the issuer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to redeem the stock (even if the right is immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercisable), but only if, based on all of the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances as of the issue date, redemption pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that right is more likely than not to occur. However, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if redemption is more likely than not to occur, paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) of this section does not apply if the redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium is solely in the nature of a penalty for premature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption. A penalty for premature redemption is a premium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid as a result of changes in economic or market conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over which neither the issuer nor the holder has control.

Safe harbor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption pursuant to an issuer's right is not treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely than not to occur if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The issuer and the holder are not related within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There are no arrangements that effectively require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issuer to redeem the stock; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Exercise of the right to redeem would not reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield of the stock, as determined under principles similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the principles of section 1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of not satisfying safe harbor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a redemption right is not described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3)(ii) of this section does not affect the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of whether the right to redeem is more likely than not to

occur.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Coordination of multiple redemption provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of stock permit redemption at more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the time and price at which redemption is most likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to occur must be determined based on all of the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances as of the issue date. Any constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construed to result only with respect to the time and price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the preceding sentence. However, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption does not occur at that identified time, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of any additional premium payable on any later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption date, to the extent not previously treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed, is treated as a constructive distribution over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period from the missed call or put date to that later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, to the extent required under the principles of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The issuer's determination as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there is a constructive distribution under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) is binding on all holders of the stock, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a holder that explicitly discloses that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination as to whether there is a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution under this paragraph (b) differs from that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issuer. Unless otherwise prescribed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return for the taxable year that includes the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder acquired the stock. The issuer must provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant information to the holder in a reasonable manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the issuer may provide the name or title and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the address or telephone number of a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the issuer who will make available to holders upon

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Corporation X is a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation with only common stock outstanding. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with its acquisition of Corporation T, X issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 shares of its 4% preferred stock to the shareholders of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T, who are unrelated to X. The issue price of the preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock is $40 per share. Each share of preferred stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convertible at the shareholder's election into three shares 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of X common stock. At the time the preferred stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued, the X common stock has a value of $10 per share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferred stock does not provide for its mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption or for redemption at the option of the holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is callable at the option of X at any time beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three years from the date of issuance for $100 per share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no other arrangements that would affect X's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to call the preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The preferred stock is described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because X and the former shareholders of T are unrelated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are no arrangements that effectively require X to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeem the stock, and calling the stock for $100 per share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not reduce the yield of the preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the $60 per share call premium is not treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a constructive distribution to the shareholders of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock under paragraph (b) of this section.

Facts_

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Corporation Y is a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation with only common stock outstanding. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1995, Y issues 100 shares of its 10% preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock to an unrelated holder. The issue price of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock is $100 per share. The preferred stock is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) Callable at the option of Y on or before January 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2000, at a price of $105 per share plus any accrued but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpaid dividends; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) Mandatorily redeemable on January 1, 2005, at a price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $100 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The preferred stock provides that if Y fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise its option to call the preferred stock on or before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 2000, the holder will be entitled to appoint a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of Y's directors. It is reasonably anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Y will have available funds sufficient to exercise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to redeem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by virtue of the change of control provision and the absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any contrary facts, it is more likely than not that Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will exercise its option to call the preferred stock on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before January 1, 2000. The safe harbor rule of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision that failure to call will cause the holder to gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the corporation is an arrangement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively requires Y to redeem the preferred stock. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution occurs over the period ending on January 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2000. Redemption is most likely to occur on that date, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because that is the date on which the corporation minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rate of return to the holder but yet prevents the holder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from gaining control. The de minimis exception of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) of this section does not apply because the $5 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
share difference between the redemption price and the issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price exceeds the amount determined under the principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1273(a)(3) (5 &times; .0025 &times; $105 = $1.31). Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5 per share, the difference between the redemption price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the issue price, is treated as a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis over the five year period ending on January 1, 2000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under principles similar to the principles of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(A) Corporation Z is a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1995, Z issues 100 shares of its 10% preferred

(B) There are no other arrangements between Z and C

concerning redemption of the stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, absent any other facts indicating a contrary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, the fact that redemption on January 1, 2000, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the yield of the stock and produce the lowest yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that exercise of the option to call on that date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is more likely than not to occur. The safe harbor rule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to call on January 1, 2000, because the call would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the yield of the stock. The de minimis exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$10 per share difference between the redemption price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable in 2000 and the issue price exceeds the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3) (5 &times; .0025 &times; $110 = $1.38). Accordingly, $10 per
share, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the redemption price and the issue price, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is treated as a constructive distribution received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder on an economic accrual basis over the five year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending January 1, 2000, under principles similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the principles of section 1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Coordination rules_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) If Z does not exercise its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to call the preferred stock on January 1, 2000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(4) of this section provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles of paragraph (b) of this section must be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine if any remaining constructive distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absent any other facts indicating a contrary result, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that redemption on July 1, 2001, would produce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowest yield indicates that exercise of the option to call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on that date is more likely than not to occur. The safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the option to call on July 1, 2001, because, as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first call date, a call by Z on July 1, 2001, for $120 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reduce the yield of the stock. The de minimis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the $10 per share difference between the redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price and the issue price (revised as of the missed call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date) exceeds the amount determined under the principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1273(a)(3) (1 &times; .0025 &times; $120 = $.30). Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $10 per share of additional redemption premium that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable on July 1, 2001, is treated as a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis over the period between January 1, 2000, and July 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2001, under principles similar to the principles of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If Z does not exercise its second option to call the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock on July 1, 2001, then the $30 additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption premium that is payable on January 1, 2003, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a constructive distribution under paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) and (b)(1) of this section. The de minimis exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $30 per share difference between the redemption price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the issue price (revised as of the second missed call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date) exceeds the amount determined under the principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1273(a)(3) (1 &times; .0025 &times; $150 = $.38). The holder is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as receiving the constructive distribution on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic accrual basis over the period between July 1, 2001, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and January 1, 2003, under principles similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles of section 1272(a).

1. Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section
112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7412 (i)(5), 57 FR 61970 (December 29, 1992). As part of that
rulemaking, EPA designated a list of 47 high risk hazardous air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions
in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards the required reductions in high-risk pollutants by assigning
these pollutants various weighting factors. Acrylic acid (CAS No. 79107) was designated as a high-risk pollutant
and was assigned a weighting factor of 10.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methodology for selecting the high-risk pollutants is documented in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices for the proposed Early Reduction Program rule (56 FR 27338) and the final regulations (as cited above). Additional
detailed information on the selection criteria is also available in the Early Reduction Program docket (Docket No.
A&hyph;90&hyph;47). In general, certain criteria were established to screen hazardous air pollutants for their
potential for high risk of adverse public health effects associated with exposure to small quantities of emissions.
The screening analysis considered health effects and potential exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on EPA's analysis of data available in 1992, acrylic acid was included on the list of high-risk pollutants based
in part on the inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for acrylic acid in EPA's Integrated Risk Information System
(IRIS). A reference concentration is an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude or more)
of the daily exposure to the human population (including sensitive subpopulations) that is likely to be without deleterious
effects during a lifetime. On February 26, 1993, Basic Acrylic Monomer Manufacturers (BAMM) filed a petition for
review of the final Early Reductions Program regulation in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit,

EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, No. 93&hyph;1179 (D.C. Cir.). On April 13, 1993, BAMM submitted an administrative petition to EPA to revise the RfC
for acrylic acid and to delete acrylic acid from the list of high-risk pollutants. BAMM submitted to EPA a new two-generation
reproductive study of acrylic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the new data led EPA to revise the RfC for acrylic acid. As a result, acrylic acid no longer meets the criteria
for inclusion on the high risk list.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of and Rationale for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Noncarcinogens meet the criteria for the high risk list if they have a verified RfC less than 0.5 micrograms per cubic
meter. The RfC for acrylic acid that was originally verified in August 1990 was 0.33 micrograms per cubic meter, based
on lesions of the nasal epithelium in a subchronic mouse inhalation study (Miller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1981).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the uncertainty factors applied to the RfC for acrylic acid was a factor of three to account for the lack of a two-generation
reproductive study.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In January, 1994, BAMM submitted additional data to EPA including a new two-generation reproductive study in rats,
a developmental study in rabbits, and a bioavailability study in rats and mice. On February 15 and 16, 1994, the IRIS
RfC/ RfD Work Group met and considered, among other things, the new two-generation reproductive study (BASF, 1993).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Work Group found that the new study met the criteria for an adequate reproductive study and accordingly increased
the RfC for acrylic acid by a factor of three. The increase in the RfC for acrylic acid by a factor of three resulted in
a revised RfC of 1 microgram per cubic meter which was made publicly available on IRIS on April 1, 1994. The revised RfC
is sufficiently high to exclude acrylic acid from the Early Reductions Program high-risk list. Consequently, today's
action proposes to delete acrylic acid from the list of high-risk pollutants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), EPA must determine whether a regulation is ``significant''
and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the Executive
Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``non significant regulatory
action''. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared and EPA has not submitted the action to
OMB for review.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to establish time-limited tolerances (with an expiration date of November 15, 1997) for residues of
the synthetic pyrethroid bifenthrin in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) corn (field, seed, and pop)
grain, silage (forage), stover (fodder), milk, milk fat, meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses,
sheep, and poultry and eggs. The proposed regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the
pesticide in or on these commodities was requested in a petition submitted by FMC Corp. EPA also proposes to extend
tolerances for the residues of bifenthrin in or on cottonseed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1987 (52 FR 45237), which announced that FMC Corp., 1735 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, had submitted
pesticide petition (PP) 7F3546 requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing tolerances for residues of
the pesticide bifenthrin, (2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate,
and its 4'-hydroxy metabolite in or on the raw agricultural commodities corn (field, seed, and pop) grain at 0.05 part
per million (ppm), forage at 2.0 ppm, fodder at 4.0 ppm, milk at 0.02 ppm, milk fat at 0.20 ppm, meat at 0.10 ppm, fat at
0.30 ppm, and meat byproducts of goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of FMC Corp., EPA issued an amended notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41473), proposing that tolerances be established as follows: Corn (field, seed, and pop) grain
at 0.05 ppm (No detectable residues were found in grain at exaggerated rates, and the proposed tolerance is based on
method sensitivity), silage (fodder) combined residue of bifenthrin plus 4'-OH bifenthrin at 2.0 ppm, stover (fodder)
for the combined residue of bifenthrin plus 4'-OH bifenthrin at 5.0 ppm; milk, fat at 1.0 ppm (reflecting 0.1 ppm in
whole milk); meat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.05 ppm; fat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep
at 1.0 ppm; and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 8, 1993, FMC Corp. requested that the pesticide petition be amended by proposing that tolerances be established
in/on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of poultry and eggs at 0.05 ppm and by deleting the 4'-hydroxy metabolite from
the tolerance expression. This amendment was submitted in response to EPA's conclusion that although residues in
poultry from existing and proposed uses are expected to be nondetectable, tolerances should be set at the limit of
quantitation and that the residue to be regulated is bifenthrin per se and not the 4'hydroxy metabolite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Metabolism studies in rats with single doses of 4 and 35 mg/kg demonstrate that about 90 percent of parent compound
and its hydroxylated metabolites are excreted. With doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, significant bioaccumulation of the
parent compound can occur in tissues with high fat content, with half-lives in these tissues of about 50 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 12-month feeding study in dogs fed dose levels of 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, or 5.0 milligrams(mg)/kilogram (kg)/day with
a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 1.5 mg/kg/day. The lowest-effect level (LEL) for this study is established
at 3.0 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence of intermittent tremors in the test animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg/day with maternal and fetal
NOELs at 1.0 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL is based on the occurrence of tremors, and the fetal NOEL is based on an increased
incidence of hydroureter without hydronephrosis at the 2.0-mg/kg/day dosage level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 2.67, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day with no developmental
toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL is established at 4 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence
of twitching and tremors at the 8 mg/kg/day dosage level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A two-generation reproduction study in rats fed diets containing 0, 30, 60, or 100 ppm with no reproductive effects
or developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL for the study is established
at 30 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg/day) based on lower body weight in females.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation in Salmonella, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary
and rat bone marrow cells, HGPRT locus mutation in mouse lymphoma cells, and unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes,
were all negative. Bifenthrin was marginally active in a forward mutation test involving the thymidine kinase locus
in mouse lymphoma cells. These test results indicate a low mutegenic potential for bifenthrin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 24-month feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 12, 50, 100, or 200 ppm with a systemic
NOEL of 50 ppm (equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/day) based on tremors, elevated body weight, and higher liver and kidney organ-to-body
weight ratios. There were no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A carcinogenicity study with mice fed diets containing 0, 50, 200, 500, or 600 ppm (equivalent to 7.5, 30, 75, or 90
mg/kg/day) for 87 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females) with a statistically significant trend for hemangiopericytomas
of the urinary bladder of male mice. In this study, male mice in the high-dose group (600 ppm) showed an increase in the
number of hemangiopericytomas of the urinary bladder as compared to the control group. Although the number of hemangiopericytomas
was twice as high in male mice at the high dose level compared to the control animals, the difference in rate of tumors
between the control group and the high-dose group was not statistically significant by pair-wise comparison. There
were also significant dose-related trends in hepatocellular carcinomas and in the combined hepatocellular adenomas
and/or carcinomas in male mice. Female mice had significantly higher incidences of combined lung adenomas and carcinomas
in the 50, 200, and 600 ppm groups, although there was no significant dose-related trend.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bifenthrin has been classified by the Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effect's Division's Carcinogenicity
Peer Review Committee (CPRC) as a Group C carcinogen, i.e., possible human carcinogen. The Agency has chosen to use
the reference dose calculations to estimate human dietary risk from bifenthrin residues. The decision supporting
classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen (Group C) rather than a probable carcinogen (Group B) was primarily
based on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Evidence for carcinogenicity was only observed in mice; no compound- related increases in tumors were observed
in the carcinogenicity study in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. It is unlikely that the hemangiopericytomas observed in the mouse study were malignant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Mutagenicity studies do not support Group B classification for bifenthrin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Feeding studies using structurally related pyrethroids, which were classified as Group C carcinogens by the CPRC,
have resulted in increased incidences of lung tumors in female mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for bifenthrin using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.015 mg/kg of body
weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 1.5 mg/kg/day from the 1-year feeding study in dogs, which demonstrated intermittent
tremors in test animals at the lowest effect level, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The current estimated dietary
exposure for the overall U.S. population resulting from established tolerances is 0.000385 mg/kg bwt/day, which
represents 2.6 percent of the RfD. The current action will increase exposure to 0.001935 mg/kg bwt/day or 12.9 percent
of the RfD. In the subgroup population exposed to the highest risk, nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the current
action would increase exposure to 0.007404 mg/kg bwt/day or 49.4 percent of the RfD. Generally speaking, EPA has no
cause for concern if total residue contribution for published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA concludes that the chronic dietary risk of bifenthrin, as estimated by the dietary risk assessment, does not appear
to be of concern. The cancer risk to humans is considered negligible, given the weight of evidence considerations,
which only support the classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen, and the low level of exposure to bifenthrin
residues in the human diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of the chemical in plants and animals for this use is adequately understood. Although a processing
study shows some concentration of bifenthrin residues in corn oil, EPA has determined that a section 409 food additive
regulation is unnecessary because it is unlikely that the bifenthrin residues in corn oil will exceed the limit of
quantification tolerance that is being established for bifenthrin in corn grain. Analysis of the field trial data
indicates that bifenthrin residue levels in corn grain will be lower than the grain tolerance by a factor greater than
the concentration factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement
methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual,
Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is
being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow,
Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Divisions (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs,
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132,
CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 5, 1988, EPA issued a conditional registration and time-limited tolerance for bifenthrin for use on cottonseed
with an expiration date of October 31, 1991 (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 15, 1988 (53 FR 30676)). On November 12, 1992, the conditional registration was amended and extended to November
15, 1993, and the tolerance on cottonseed extended to November 15, 1994 (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Registers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54094) and February 22, 1994 (59 FR 9411)). On November 15, 1993, EPA amended the registration
on cottonseed by extending the expiration date to November 15, 1996. The registration was amended and extended to
allow time for submission and evaluation of additional environmental effects data. In order to evaluate the effects
of bifenthrin on fish and aquatic organisms and its fate in the environment, additional data were required to be collected
and submitted during the period of conditional registration. Such requirements included a sediment bioavailability
and toxicity study and a small-plot runoff study that must be submitted to the Agency by July 1, 1996. To be consistent
with the extension issued for the conditional registration, the Agency is proposing to extend the tolerance on cottonseed
and other commodities, and establish a time-limited tolerance on corn (field, seed, and pop) with an expiration date
of November 15, 1997, to cover residues expected to result from use during the period of conditional registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which it is sought. Based on the information and data considered,
the Agency concludes that the proposed section 408 tolerances and extension will protect the public health. Therefore,
it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3921/P584]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 This document proposes that ethyl oleate (ethyl esters of fatty acids derived from edible fats and oils) be exempted
from the requirement of a tolerance when used as an inert ingredient (solvent, cosolvent) in pesticide formulations
applied to growing crops or raw agricultural commodities after harvest. This proposed regulation was requested
by Victorian Chemicals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Victorian Chemical Co. Pty. Ltd., 37-49 Appleton St., P.O. Box 71, Richmond, Victoria, 3121 Australia, submitted
pesticide petition (PP) 4E4303 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance for ethyl oleate (ethyl esters of fatty acids derived from edible fats and oils)
when used as a solvent or cosolvent in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or raw agricultural commodities
after harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125 and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statment
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for ethyl oleate will need to
be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Ethyl oleate, as defined, is expected to be metabolized to ethyl alcohol and edible fatty acids, rendering it of
minimal toxicological concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. There is no significant difference between ethyl oleate and methyl oleate, which is approved under 40 CFR 180.1001(c).
In fact, as noted by the FDA (57 FR 12709, Apr. 13, 1992), on an equal basis, methyl esters of fatty acids have more toxic
potential than the ethyl esters because of the potential for the release of methyl alcohol.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The FDA has approved ethyl oleate as a direct food additive in aqueous emulsions for dehydrating grapes to produce
raisins under 21 CFR 172.225.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredeint is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within
30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300345]. All written comments filed in response to this document will
be available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the Virginia address given
above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Du Pont Chemicals, Chestnut Run Plaza, P.O. Box 80711, Wilmington, DE 19880-0711, submitted pesticide petition
(PP) 1E3990 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a
tolerance for dimethyl ether (DME) when used as an aerosol propellant in pesticide formulations applied to animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted
in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for dimethyl ether will need
to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A cardiac sensitization study in the dog with a no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) of 100,000 parts per
million and a lowest-observed-adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 200,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 4-hour acute inhalation toxicity study in the male rat with an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 164,000 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No evidence of mutagenicity with and without metabolic activation when exposed in a closed system to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 strains at concentrations determined in a cytotoxicity test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 2-week inhalation study in rats with a NOAEL of less than 10,000 ppm. 5. A 4-week inhalation study in hamsters showing
changes in red blood cell counts in females and decreased white blood cell counts in both males and females and decreased
body weight and relative spleen weight in males with a NOAEL of 2,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A 13-week inhalation study in rats showing elevated neutrophil counts in all test groups with a NOAEL of less than
1,000 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 13-week inhalation study in hamsters showing decreased red blood cell count and hemoglobin in males with a NOAEL
of 5,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A 2-year rat inhalation study in rats showing female rats had a statistically significant increase in total mammary
tumors at the highest concentration tested and a significant positive trend for total mammary tumors. The Cancer
Peer Review Committee concluded that this was due to the less-than-usual incidence of total mammary tumors in the
control group, compared to historical controls, and concluded that there was no convincing evidence of carcinogenicity
in this study. The systemic LOEL in this study is 0.2% (2,000 ppm) based on a significant increase in the incidence of
splenic congestion in males at 6 months, decreased red cell count in males and females at the mid and high doses at 6 months,
increased absolute spleen weight in males at the high concentration at 6 and 12 months, and congestion of the spleen
in males at the high dose at 6 months. The systemic NOEL is less than 0.2% (2,000 ppm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Two rat developmental effects studies by inhalation with a NOEL for maternal toxicity of 2% DME and a NOEL for developmental
toxicity of 0.125% DME. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the revocation of certain tolerances, exemptions from tolerances, and food additive regulations
(``tolerances'') established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C.
346a and 348) for residues of the insecticide/miticide tetradifon and the fungicide sulfur dioxide in or on raw agricultural
commodities (RACs) and processed foods. EPA is initiating this action because all registered food uses associated
with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerances, and food additive regulations have been canceled. The registrations
for sulfur dioxide and tetradifon were canceled because the registrant failed to pay the required maintenance fee
and/or the registrant voluntarily canceled all registered uses of the pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the fact that there are no current food use registrations associated with these tolerances, exemptions from
tolerance, and food additive regulations, EPA proposes to revoke them. A tolerance, an exemption from tolerance,
or a food additive regulation is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical that is not registered for a particular
food use. The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerance regulations.
Since there are no food use registrations associated with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food
additive regulations, and hence no legal use in the United States, and since these pesticides are either not persistent
or sufficient time has elapsed since their prior use for residues to dissipate, residues should not appear in any domestically
produced commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances for residues of the insecticide/miticide tetradifon (2,4,5,4'-tetrachlorodiphenyl
sulfone) as listed in 40 CFR 180.174 in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peppermint and spearmint
(100 ppm); fresh hops (30 ppm); figs (6 ppm); apples, apricots, cherries, crabapples, grapes, nectarines, peaches,
pears, plums (fresh prunes), quinces, and strawberries (5 ppm); citrus citron, grapefruit, lemons, limes, oranges,
and tangerines (2 ppm); cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, and winter squash (1 ppm); meat and milk (0 ppm). EPA
proposes to revoke the exemption from tolerance for residues of the fungicide sulfur dioxide as listed in 40 CFR 180.1013:
(1) liquid grain-fumigant formulations for marker or fire-retardant purposes at levels not exceeding 5 percent
by weight of such formulations are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on barley, buckwheat, corn, oats,
popcorn, rice, rye, grain sorghum (milo), and wheat; (2) residues of sulfur dioxide resulting from postharvest fungicidal
use are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on corn for feed use only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also proposes to revoke the food additive regulations for residues of the pesticide tetradifon (2,4,5,4'-tetrachlorodiphenyl
sulfone) as listed in 40 CFR 185.5475 in or on the following commodities: dried hops (120 ppm); dried figs (10 ppm);
dried tea (8 ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains sulfur dioxide or tetradifon may request, within 30 days
after publication of this document in the

, that the proposal to revoke the RAC tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e)
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation, revoking the tolerances and
exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for raw agricultural commodities, and food additive regulations for
processed foods. Further, EPA is soliciting comments from any person adversely affected by revocation of the tolerances,
exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations. EPA requests that anyone adversely affected by these
revocations submit information providing the following specific information: (1) Are there any existing stocks
of the chemical?; (2) If so, how much?; (3) When will the stocks be depleted?; (4) How long would the commodities treated
with these chemicals be in the channels of trade?

Executive Order 12866

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4. 1993), the Agency must determine whether a proposed regulatory action
being proposed is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory
Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'') ;
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this
Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations,
or small governmental jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all domestic registrations for these uses of tetradifon and sulfur dioxide have been canceled, it is anticipated
that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance,
and food additive regulations are revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes that the tolerance exemptions for three encapsulating polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene),
poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer be amended to removed language
not directly related to the inert ingredient exemption and to replace the specific tolerance exemption listings
in 40 CFR part 180 for these polymers with general listings under 40 CFR 180.1001(c). This change was requested by International
Specialty Products. On its own inititative, the Agency is also deleting similar language in the tolerance exemption
for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 International Specialty Products (ISP), 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, has submitted petitions to amend the exemptions
from tolerance for poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), pesticide petition (PP) 4E4307, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene),
PP 4E4304, and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, PP 4E4306, to remove the specific exemptions in 40 CFR
part 180 for these polymeric encapsulating agents and list them in 40 CFR 180.1001(c). The changes would eliminate
the following statement which was included in each separate exemption from tolerance: ``Registration of each new
pesticide formulation incorporating this dispersing agent must be supported by residue data for the active ingredient(s).''
The petition notes that it is EPA's policy that the data requirements for registration are associated with registered
pesticide products, not inert ingredients. Data may be required on a case-by-case basis for a registered product
when substantial changes are made in the inert ingredients included in the product's formulation, but such data requirements
are not triggered universally by the addition of a specific inert ingredient to the formulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The addition of this language to the tolerance exemption was triggered by concern that the nature of the inert encapsulating
material may affect the residue levels of active ingredients and, therefore, the Agency needed a mechanism to ensure
that each formulation of this type be evaluated for this possibility. However, the Agency agrees that including this
language in the exemption from tolerance expression is an inappropriate way to obtain such assurance. In August 1993,
the Agency issued to product managers internal guidance entitled, ``Data Requirements for Formulations and Translation
of Residue Data between Formulations.'' The document informed product managers that any new food-use pesticide
product which is considered a microencapsulated or controlled-release formulation should be reviewed by residue
chemists to determine ``if there has been a change in the inert ingredients (especially the encapsulating polymer)
that could affect residues of the active ingredient.'' This internal guidance should address the concerns which
led to the inclusion of the objectionable language in these tolerance exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the three polymers of these petitions, the Agency has noted that there is a specific exemption for cross-linked
polyurea-type encapsulating polymer (40 CFR 180.1039) that contains the same language as the three polymers for
which petitions were submitted as well as additional language on quality control procedures to ensure predictable
release characteristics and relatively uniform toxicity of various production lots. This language also refers
to data requirements for the encapsulated pesticide product formulation and is not appropriate to the tolerance
exemption for the inert ingredient. Therefore, the Agency has also decided to amend this exemption to delete the second
sentence of the tolerance exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300348]. All written comments filed in response to this document will
be available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the Virginia address given

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

On May 4, 1994, the Department of the Interior issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 23097) to revise the natural
resource damage assessment regulations. The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures
for assessing damages for injury to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under
the Clean Water Act, or a release of a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act. The Department is extending the period for comment on the proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures for calculating damages for natural resource
injuries under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.
9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The regulations provide an administrative
process for conducting assessments as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries
and damages. ``Type A'' procedures are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field
observation in cases of minor discharges or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific
procedures for detailed assessments in other cases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 4, 1994, the Department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing the assessment of damages for lost
nonuse values of injured natural resources using type B procedures. 59 FR 23097. Nonuse values are those economic
values that are not dependent on use of a resource and include the value of knowing that the resource exists and knowing
that a resource will be available for future generations. The only method currently available for the express purpose
of estimating nonuse values is the contingent valuation (CV) methodology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two provisions of the original natural resource damage assessment regulations restricted the use of type B procedures
to estimate lost nonuse values to cases in which lost use values could not be determined. 43 CFR 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii)
(1993).

) held that these restrictions were inconsistent with section 301 of CERCLA. 880 F.2d 432, 464 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The
court remanded these provisions, along with several other issues, to the Department and ordered the Department to
promulgate new rules on the remanded issues. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule addressing all
aspects of the court remand except the estimation of lost nonuse values. 59 FR 14262. The Department's March 25, 1994,
final rule renumbered 43 CFR 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) (1993) as new &sect;&sect;11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B),
temporarily leaving the existing invalid rule language ``on the books'' without substantively addressing in any
way that language or the use of CV for estimating nonuse values. The May 4, 1994, Federal Register notice proposed standards
for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. Pending the completion of this rulemaking, the existing restrictive
rule language concerning the estimation of lost nonuse values, which was struck down in

 remains invalid and ineffective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the May 4, 1994, proposed rule was originally set to expire on July 7, 1994. The Department has
received several requests from the public for additional time to comment on the proposed rule and has decided to extend
the comment period to October 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is coordinating this rulemaking with a rulemaking being conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). NOAA has published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under the Oil Pollution
Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.). 59 FR 1061 (January 7, 1994). In a separate notice in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of lost nonuse values contained in the Department's May 4, 1994,

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Simla B. Ellis d/b/a SoTo Broadcasting, permittee of a new
FM station, Channel 266A, Mamou, Louisiana, proposing the substitution of Channel 266C3 for Channel 266A at Mamou
and modification of SoTo's authorization to specify operation on the higher powered channel. In order to accommodate
the upgrade at Mamou, we also propose to substitute Channel 286A for vacant Channel 266A at Jonesville, Louisiana.
Channel 266C3 and Channel 286A can be allotted to Mamou and Jonesville, respectively, in compliance with the Commission's
minimum distance separation requirements. Channel 266C3 can be allotted with a site restriction of 12.2 kilometers
(7.6 miles) east to accommodate SoTo's desired site. The coordinates for Channel 266C3 are 30&hyph;39&hyph;42 and
92&hyph;17&hyph;52. The coordinates for Channel 286A at Jonesville are 31&hyph;35&hyph;38 and 91&hyph;45&hyph;23.

This document requests comments on a petition by Michael Scott Clem seeking the allotment of Channel 255A to Galatia,
Illinois, as that community's first aural FM transmission service. Channel 255A can be allotted to Galatia in compliance
with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles)
northwest, in order to avoid a short-spacing to Station WKDQ(FM), Channel 258C, Henderson, Kentucky. The coordinates
for Channel 255A at Galatia, Illinois, are North Latitude 37&hyph;50&hyph;53 and West Longitude 88&hyph;37&hyph;10.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By decision served May 24, 1994 (59 FR 27002, May 25, 1994), the Commission sought public comment by June 14, 1994, on
a proposal to revise its regulations pertaining to registration by motor carriers with States. The Commission now
is extending the due date for comments to June 28, 1994. The National Conference of State Transportation Specialists
(NCSTS) has advised the Commission that it is holding its annual conference between June 12 and 16, 1994, and that its
membership will have the opportunity to discuss the Commission's proposed amendments at the conference. As the conference
will not end until after the original due date for comments, the NCSTS requires an extension of the comment period.
The Commission therefore is granting an extension to give the NCSTS the time it needs to formulate and submit its comments.

program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed
species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation
of the species, establish criteria for reclassification or delisting, and estimate time and cost for implementing
the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

Railroad Valley springfish are endemic to two springs at Duckwater and four springs at Lockes, Railroad Valley, Nye
County, Nevada. The species has been introduced into four additional springs in Nevada outside the species' historical
range. Railroad Valley springfish are extant in all historical habitats and three introduction habitats. Populations
vary from fewer than one hundred to several thousand individuals. The principle causes of decline for this species
are habitat modification and nonnative fish introductions. All historical habitats are designated critical habitat
for this species. Railroad Valley springfish occupy habitats on private, Federal, and Indian Reservation lands.
Recovery of this species will require removal and/or control of nonnative fishes, restoration and protection of
occupied habitats, and protection of ground water sources.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the campus-based programs (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal
Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs). These amendments
are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The Secretary also proposes
to reduce the administrative burden imposed on applicants for student financial assistance and educational institutions
resulting from the verification requirements by amending the verification regulations contained in subpart E of
the Student Assistance General Provisions, 34 CFR part 668.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Student Assistance General Provisions regulations implement requirements that are common to the student financial
assistance programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (title IV, HEA programs). The title
IV, HEA programs include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Student Loan,
State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG), Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 21, 1992, a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requesting public comments on statutes and regulations that substantially impede economic growth, are no longer
needed, or otherwise impose unnecessary costs or burdens. The proposed change to the Student Assistance General
Provisions regulations results from the public comments received in response to that notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed amendments also revise the existing campus-based program regulations. The campus-based programs
are authorized as follows: Federal Perkins Loan_20 U.S.C. 1087aa&hyph;1087hh and 20 U.S.C. 421&hyph;429; FWS_42
U.S.C. 2751&hyph;2756b; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSEOG_20 U.S.C. 1070b&hyph;1070b&hyph;3. These proposed regulations would implement provisions of the Crime
Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647), enacted November 29, 1990, the National and Community Service Act of 1990
(Pub. L. 101&hyph;610), enacted November 16, 1990, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325),
enacted July 23, 1992 (Amendments), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208),
enacted December 20, 1993 (Technical Amendments). A description of the major proposed changes follows. The proposed
changes that pertain to more than one program are described first followed by descriptions of provisions that pertain
to only a specific program. The Federal student financial assistance programs support the National Education Goals
by enhancing opportunities for postsecondary education. The National Education Goals call for increasing the rate
at which students graduate from high school and pursue high quality postsecondary education and for supporting life-long
learning.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The verification regulations contained in subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34
CFR part 688) govern verification of the information that is used to calculate an applicant's expected family contribution
(EFC) as part of determining an applicant's need for student financial assistance. The EFC is the amount that an applicant
and the applicant's family reasonably can be expected to contribute toward the applicant's cost of attendance at
an institution of higher education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, dependent applicants are required to provide the signature of both parents when verifying the number
of family household members enrolled in postsecondary institutions. The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;668.57(c)
to require the signature of one parent instead of both parents. If only one parent's income is considered in the title
IV, HEA aid awarding process, that is the parent who must sign. Otherwise, either parent may sign. This amendment is
being proposed in an effort to reduce the administrative burden imposed on applicants and institutions by the verification
requirements.

The current regulations restrict eligibility for Federal Perkins Loan and FWS assistance for undergraduate students
to those who have not already earned baccalaureate or first professional degrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments changed the Federal Perkins Loan and FWS programs to provide that a student is not ineligible for assistance
because he or she has previously received a baccalaureate or professional degree. Therefore, the Secretary proposes
to amend the definition of ``undergraduate student'' to delete the restriction from the current Federal Perkins
Loan and FWS regulations. The statutory restriction remains for the FSEOG program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;&sect;674.4, 675.4, and 676.4 in accordance with amended sections 413D(e)(2),
422(e)(2), and 462(j)(4) of the HEA to state that if an institution returns more than 10 percent of its Federal Perkins
Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an award year, the institution will have its allocation for the next fiscal year
for that program reduced by the dollar amount returned. The Amendments established this requirement for the Federal
Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs. The same requirement was provided for the FWS Program by the Technical Amendments.
These statutory provisions authorize the Secretary to take appropriate measures to ensure effective use of program
funds when an institution fails to expend its allocation. The Secretary may waive these provisions if enforcement
would be contrary to the interest of the programs. To accomplish the purpose of the statute, the Secretary expects
to find enforcement to be contrary to the interest of the program in very limited circumstances, such as a natural disaster.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;&sect;674.10, 675.10, and 676.10 in accordance with amended sections 413C(d),
443(b)(3), and 464(b)(2) of the HEA to state that if an institution's FSEOG allocation, FWS grant, or Federal Perkins
Loan capital contribution is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need of less-than-full-time or
independent students and if the need of all of these students exceeds 5 percent of the total need of all students at an
institution, then at least 5 percent of that allotment for FSEOG, 5 percent of that grant for FWS, or 5 percent of the
dollar amount of the loans made for Federal Perkins must be made available to these students.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 674.14, 675.14, and 676.14&blank;Overaward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A financial aid administratrato may not award or disburse aid from a campus-based program if that aid, when combined
with all other resources, would exceed the student's need. Before awarding aid from campus-based programs, the aid
administrator must take into account the aid that the student will receive from other student financial assistance
programs and other resources that the aid administrator knows about or can reasonably anticipate at the time aid is
awarded to the student. If the student receives additional resources at any time during the award period that were
not considered in determining the student's eligibility for aid, and these resources combined with the expected
financial aid will exceed the student's need, the amount in excess of the student's need is considered an overaward.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the situation in which an institution learns that a student has received additional resources that were not included
in calculating the student's eligibility for financial assistance, the regulations for the three campus-based
programs currently permit a student's resources to exceed the student's financial need by no more than $200. Further,
the current regulations allow an institution to continue to employ a student under the FWS program after the full financial
need has been met until the student's cumulative earnings from both need-based and non-need-based employment exceed
his or her financial need by more than $200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 443(b)(4) of the HEA has been amended to allow a student employed under the FWS program to earn up to $300 from
need-based employment in excess of his or her financial need before employment under the FWS program must be discontinued.
In addition, for the purpose of determining when FWS funds may no longer be used to pay the student, an institution will
not be required to monitor the student's non-need-based earnings. (However, as in the past, earnings from non-need-based
employment will be counted as income for the following year.) Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to amend the regulations
for the FWS program in accordance with the statute to provide that a student employed under the FWS program may continue
to receive FWS funding after the student's full financial need has been met until the student's cumulative earnings
from need-based employment exceed his or her financial need by more than $300. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not address the common situation whereby a student receives a financial aid package consisting of
an FWS award in combination with a Federal Perkins Loan or FSEOG award or both. The Secretary is proposing to change
the current $200 overaward threshold for this situation. Under the proposed change, if FWS is awarded to a student
by itself or in combination with one or both of the other campus-based programs, then a $300 overaward threshold will
be in effect. However, under the proposed change, if a student is not employed under the FWS program but is receiving
a Federal Perkins Loan or FSEOG, the current regulatory $200 overaward threshold will still be in effect for those
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making awards, an institution may not make campus-based awards in excess of the amount of the student's need. Although
a threshold is allowed subsequent to the packaging of campus-based aid, the threshold does not allow an institution
deliberately to award campus-based aid that, in combination with other resources, exceeds the student's financial
need.

Section 676.16&blank;Payment of an FSEOG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to allow institutions to disburse a Federal Perkins Loan or an FSEOG award after a student ceases
to be enrolled under certain circumstances. Currently, the Federal Perkins Loan and the FSEOG programs do not provide
for late disbursements while the other title IV, HEA programs have provisions for late disbursements. This proposed
change would prevent a student from being penalized because the student did not receive funds that he or she needed
and expected due to a delay in payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow an institution to disburse funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs to a student
when he or she is no longer enrolled if the assistance was awarded while the student was still an eligible student. Further,
the institution must determine that the funds are needed to cover the student's documented educational costs that
are normally included in the student's cost of attendance under section 472 of the HEA for the payment period for which
the loan or grant was intended and the student was actually enrolled. The institution would be expected to collect
and retain documentation supporting the amount of and the reason for the late disbursement paid to the student.

Section 674.2&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 462(h) of the HEA replaced the dollar-volume ``default rate'' calculation in the Federal Perkins Loan program
with a borrower-based ``cohort default rate,'' beginning in the 1993&hyph;94 award year. Accordingly, the Secretary
proposes to amend &sect;674.2 to remove the definition of ``default rate,'' ``defaulted principal amount,'' and
``matured loans,'' which are definitions used in the calculation of an institution's ``default rate,'' but are not
used in the ``cohort default rate'' calculation. Section 462(h) of the HEA also provides that any loan on which the
borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to resume repayment is not counted toward an institution's cohort default
rate. ``Satisfactory arrangements to resume payment'' is a term currently used in the FFEL program. The Secretary
proposes to add the same definition of ``satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan'' to &sect;674.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments in section 464(c)(2)(A) of the HEA created a new economic hardship deferment and added a new provision
of forbearance in section 464(e), both of which were also provisions added to the FFEL program. Negotiated rulemaking
in the FFEL program resulted in the requirement that in order for a borrower to establish eligibility for an economic
hardship deferment or for forbearance of payments, the borrower would be required to provide certain documentation
to the granting institution, including evidence showing the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income.
The Secretary proposes to add the same definition of ``disposable income'' as resulted from the negotiated rulemaking
process for the FFEL program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 484 of the HEA now permits borrowers pursuing a second baccalaureate degree to receive assistance under the
Federal Perkins Loan program. The Secretary is, therefore, proposing to amend the definition of ``undergraduate
student'' in &sect;674.2 of the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific date on which a loan is made to a borrower as well as the specific date on which a borrower enters repayment
on his or her Federal Perkins Loan is critical to the determination of eligibility for certain benefits (for example,
deferments, cancellations, exclusion from an institution's cohort default rate, interest rates, and grace periods).
However, there has been some confusion on the meaning of these concepts. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to incorporate
into the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations the definitions of the term ``making of a loan'' and the term ``enter
repayment.'' These definitions are based on common institutional practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is aware that the term ``Direct Loans'' when used to mean a ``National Direct Student Loan'' is the same
as the term used to mean the new ``Federal Direct Student Loan'' and will clarify the distinction between these two
terms.

Section 674.4&blank;Allocation and Reallocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;674.4 to incorporate the requirements in section 462(j) of the HEA that the
Secretary shall reallocate 80 percent of the available funds to institutions that participated in the Federal Perkins
Loan program in the 1985&hyph;86 award year but did not receive an allocation for the award year for which the reallocation
determination is made. The reallocated amount may not exceed the institution's fair share shortfall amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 462(j) of the HEA requires that the remaining 20 percent must be reallocated in accordance with the regulations.
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;674.4 to provide for the flexibility to reallocate the 20 percent of unexpended
funds. This change would allow the Secretary to assist students who suffer financial harm from a natural disaster
such as a flood or hurricane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 462(e)(2) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish an appeals process by which the anticipated collections
required in section 462(e)(1) may be waived for institutions with ``low default rates'' in the Federal Perkins Loan
program. The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;674.4 to incorporate an automatic appeals process. The Secretary
would waive the calculation of anticipated collections in section 462(e)(1) for any institution with a cohort default
rate that does not exceed 7.5 percent and would instead use an amount equal to actual collections during the second
year preceding the beginning of the award year.

Section 674.5&blank;Federal Perkins Loan Cohort Default Rate and Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add new &sect;674.5 to the regulations. This section establishes, in accordance with section
462(f) of the HEA, the Federal Perkins Loan program cohort default rate and penalties for an institution with a high
cohort default rate for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years. This section includes the definition
of which loans are to be included in the cohort default rate calculation and provisions detailing how the cohort default
rate would be calculated for an institution with more than one location or undergoing a change in status, in accordance
with section 462(h)(3)(G) of the HEA which requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations designed to prevent an
institution from evading the application of the cohort default rate because of situations such as changing control
of the institution. These provisions on calculating a cohort default rate for locations of an institution are the
same as in the FFEL Program.

Section 674.6&blank;Default Reduction Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add new &sect;674.6 to the regulations. The proposed requirements in &sect;674.6 describe
measures that an institution participating in the Federal Perkins Loan program must take to reduce its cohort default
rate. Section 462(f) of the HEA now requires that beginning in the 1994&hyph;95 award year, if an institution's cohort
default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default reduction plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Secretary's intent that an institution be able to coordinate its default reduction efforts in the Federal
Perkins Loan program with its default reduction plan under the requirements of the FFEL program. To that end, the Secretary
is proposing to require institutions with a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 15 percent to implement a default
reduction plan that is similar to the plan established by the FFEL program in appendix D of part 668. Any substantive
differences from appendix D are related to characteristics specific to the FFEL program. Section 674.6(b) describes
the plan that an institution will be required to establish to reduce Federal Perkins Loan defaults by its students
in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments, in section 463(a)(2)(B) of the HEA, established the Expanded Lending Option (ELO) beginning in the
1993&hyph;94 award year for institutions with default rates of 7.5 percent or less that have executed an ELO participation
agreement with the Secretary. The Technical Amendments further amended that section to provide for a cohort default
rate of 15 percent or less to participate in the ELO for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years. This
was necessary because a default rate will no longer be calculated for an institution. Instead, as required by the Amendments
the default rate calculation has been replaced by a cohort default rate calculation for the Federal Perkins Loan Program.

Institutions that receive a Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) and participate in the ELO are required to match the
FCC on a dollar-for-dollar basis and are allowed to make loans to students at higher annual maximum and aggregate loan
limits than is the case at nonparticipating institutions. The Secretary proposes to add this section to incorporate
these statutory changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 463(a)(2)(B) of the HEA increased the capital contribution requirements for institutions that have a participation
agreement with the Secretary to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan program in the 1993&hyph;94 award year and
subsequent award years. The Secretary proposes to include in the participation agreement, under &sect;674.8, these
new capital contribution requirements. In addition, the HEA eliminated the definition of default rate and implemented
the cohort default rate, which includes new reporting requirements. The Secretary therefore proposes to amend the
regulations to incorporate new reporting requirements containing information that the Department will use to determine
an institution's cohort default rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to section 461(a) of the HEA provide for the eligibility of a student engaged in a program of study abroad.
This program must be approved for credit by the home institution. The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations
to reflect this statutory change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to incorporate the new statutory requirement (section 464(b)(1)
of the HEA) that a student must provide a driver's license number, if any, to the institution at the time of application
for the Federal Perkins Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to amend &sect;674.9 to require that, to establish eligibility to receive additional
Federal Perkins Loan funds, a borrower must reaffirm a Federal Perkins Loan debt that was previously cancelled due
to the borrower's total and permanent disability, discharged in bankruptcy, or written off (if the amount of the write
off exceeded $25). This proposal has been incorporated from the current Federal Family Education Loan program regulations
as part of the Secretary's on-going effort to maintain similar provisions, wherever possible, in the title IV, HEA
student loan programs. This proposal would treat any borrower who has not satisfied a previous Federal Perkins Loan
debt in a manner that is consistent with 34 CFR 668.7(a)(7), which provides that a borrower who is in default on a Federal
Perkins Loan is ineligible for new loans. It is the Secretary's position that cancellation in exchange for performing
a service (such as teaching in a low-income school or teaching disabled children) satisfies the debt but cancellation
for total and permanent disability or bankruptcy does not satisfy the debt.

The Amendments establish annual maximum loan amounts and increase the aggregate maximum loan amounts allowable

in the ELO or whether the student is in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the home institution. The Secretary
proposes to amend the maximum loan limits in &sect;674.12 to reflect the statutory changes.

The Amendments require an institution to report to any one national credit bureau organization with which the Secretary
has an agreement the amount of the Federal Perkins Loan made to a borrower. The Technical Amendments require that an
institution report this information at least annually. The Secretary proposes in &sect;674.16 to incorporate the
new statutory requirement that an institution report loan disbursements to a national credit bureau organization,
in accordance with section 463(c)(4) of the HEA. In addition, the Secretary proposes to establish procedures by which
a borrower may not be required to sign for any advance of funds made while the borrower is in a program of study abroad,
if obtaining the borrower's signature would pose an undue hardship on the institution.

The Secretary is proposing, in accordance with amended section 464(c) of the HEA, to allow an institution to increase
to $40 the minimum monthly repayment amount provided for in the loan agreement. This provision applies to loans for
which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1992, to a borrower who on the date the loan is made owes no
balance on any Federal Perkins Loan or National Direct Student Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Amendments also established forbearance of principal and interest, or principal only, as requested in writing
by the borrower, if the borrower's monthly title IV, HEA loan repayment obligation equals or exceeds 20 percent of
the borrower's monthly disposable income. The institution may also grant forbearance to a borrower if it identifies
other reasons that warrant it. The Secretary proposes to add this provision to this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage repayment of defaulted loans, the Amendments provide that the Secretary may authorize an institution

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective for loans made on or after July 1, 1993, the deferment provisions under the Federal Perkins Loan Program
will change in accordance with amended section 464(c)(2)(A) of the HEA. The Secretary is proposing to revise the regulations
to reflect this change. Loan repayment for these loans may be deferred for periods during which a borrower: (1) Is at
least a half-time student; (2) is pursuing a course of study in a graduate fellowship program approved by the Secretary
or in a rehabilitation training program for disabled individuals approved by the Secretary, excluding a medical
internship or residency program; (3) is, for a period not to exceed three years, unable to find full-time employment;
(4) is, for a period not to exceed three years, suffering an economic hardship; or (5) is engaged in service described
under the cancellation provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of economic hardship proposed in these regulations is the same as the definition of economic hardship
as was proposed in the FFEL program notice of proposed rulemaking, published on March 24, 1994. The Secretary will
incorporate the same definition of economic hardship into the Federal Perkins Loan, the FFEL, and the Federal Direct
Student Loan program regulations based on public comments received on this notice, the FFEL program notice, the discussions
of the negotiators during the Federal Direct Student Loan program negotiated rulemaking sessions, and the public
comments received on proposed regulations in the Federal Direct Student Loan program.

Section 674.54&blank;Teacher Cancellation_Federal Perkins Loans and Direct Loans Made Before July 23, 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;674.54 to reflect the statutory elimination of the 50-percent limitation
on all Chapter 1 schools in a State. Teaching in any Chapter 1 school will now qualify a borrower for a loan cancellation.

Section 674.56&blank;Employment Cancellation_Federal Perkins Loans and Direct Loans Made On or After July 23,
1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments expanded the cancellation provisions for loans made on or after July 23, 1992, to include the following
services: (1) A full-time nurse or medical technician; (2) a full-time employee of a public or private nonprofit child
or family service agency who is providing or supervising the provision of services to high-risk children and their
families from low-income communities; or (3) a full-time qualified professional provider of early intervention
services in a public or other nonprofit program under public supervision by the lead agency. The Secretary proposes
to add this section to incorporate these changes.

Section 674.57&blank;Cancellation for Law Enforcement or Corrections Officer Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 465(a)(2) of the HEA was amended by the Police Recruitment and Education Program (PREP), a provision of the
Crime Control Act of 1990. PREP provides for Federal Perkins Loan and National Direct Student Loan cancellation benefits
for full-time law enforcement or corrections officers providing service to local, State, and Federal law enforcement
or corrections agencies. The provision only applies to Federal Perkins Loans and Direct Loans made on or after November
29, 1990. The Secretary is proposing to add a new &sect;674.57 to the regulations to reflect these provisions. In developing
&sect;674.57, the Secretary relied on the experience gained from the Law Enforcement Education Program (LEEP),
a highly successful program in the 1970's that provided financial assistance to law enforcement officers to attend
an institution of higher education. The concepts of an eligible agency, a law enforcement officer, and eligible service
were drawn from LEEP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three (3) Federal work-study programs under section 441 of the HEA are the Federal Work-Study program under subpart
A (formerly named the College Work-Study program), the Job Location and Development program under subpart B, and
the Work-Colleges program under the new subpart C. These programs will be known collectively as the Federal Work-Study
programs.

Section 675.1&blank;Purpose and Identification of Common Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National and Community Service Act Amendments of 1990 authorized the creation of full- and part-time national
and community service programs. In an effort to increase participation in community service, Congress amended the
statement of purpose for the FWS program, in section 441(a) of the HEA, to encourage students receiving program assistance
to participate in community service activities. The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;675.1(a) in accordance with
the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 675.2&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the definitions section to add a new definition of ``low-income individual'' for
purposes of community services. The Secretary is proposing to use the same definition provided for in &sect;674.33(c)
of the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations. The Secretary believes that the ``income protection allowance''
(IPA) is the best indicator of a ``low-income individual.'' Also, the IPA charts are very accessible because the Secretary
publishes annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Section 675.8&blank;Program Participation Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to amend the provisions governing the program participation agreement between the Secretary
and the institution in &sect;675.8 in accordance with the statutory change in section 443(b) of the HEA to add assurances
that: (1) employment under the program may be used to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities;
and (2) institutions will inform all eligible students of the opportunity to perform community service and will consult
with local nonprofit, governmental, and community-based organizations to identify community service opportunities.
In identifying community service opportunities, the Secretary expects institutions to consult with their students.

Section 675.18&blank;Use of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing several amendments to &sect;675.18. First, in accordance with section 448(b)(1) of the
HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18(a) to provide that institutions participating in the Work-Colleges
program may use funds allocated under section 442 of the HEA for meeting costs of the Work-Colleges program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, in accordance with section 447 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18(b)(5) to eliminate
the institutional administrative expense allowance for work-study for community service learning. Institutions
would, however, be allowed to use up to 10 percent of the funds available for the institution's administrative cost
allowance and attributable to the institution's FWS program expenditures to cover expenses incurred for its program
of community services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in accordance with section 488 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18(f)(1) to increase
the amount of an institution's allocation under the FWS programs that may be transferred to the FSEOG program from
10 percent to 25 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, in accordance with section 445(b)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18 to provide
that an institution is authorized to make payments to students for services performed on or after May 15 of the previous
award year but prior to the beginning of the succeeding award year (that is, for summer employment) from the succeeding
award year's allocation. This carry-back authority would be in addition to the existing authority to carry-back
10 percent of the succeeding year's allocation for use at any time during the preceding award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, in accordance with section 443(b)(2)(A) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18 to provide
that institutions are required to use at least 5 percent of the total funds granted to the institution to compensate
students employed in community service activities for the 1994&hyph;95 and subsequent award years. If an institution
is unable to comply with this requirement to provide community services, the institution may request a waiver of this
requirement. The Secretary will approve a waiver if the Secretary determines that enforcing this requirement would
create a hardship for students at the institution. The public is invited to comment on the circumstances under which
the community service requirement might create a hardship for students.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide that a proprietary institution may employ a student to work for the institution in jobs
that are in community services but also involve the provision of student services that are directly related to the
work-study student's training or education. In accordance with section 443(b)(8) of the HEA, as amended by the Technical
Amendments, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.21(b) to provide that a student employed by a proprietary
institution and performing community services is no longer also required to be furnishing student services. This
change would help promote community services because of the limited employment opportunities that satisfy both
types of services.

Section 675.26&blank;FWS Federal Share Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide that the Federal share of FWS compensation paid to a student employed other than by a for-profit
organization may not exceed 70 percent. In accordance with section 443(b)(5) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing
to amend &sect;675.26 to increase the Federal share to 75 percent. However, the Federal share of FWS compensation
paid to a student employed by a for-profit organization still may not exceed 50 percent as established by the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the Secretary will continue to authorize a Federal share of 100 percent of the compensation
earned by students during an award year if all of the following criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The work performed by the student is for the institution itself, for a Federal, state or local public agency, or for
a private nonprofit organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The institution at which the student is enrolled is designated as an eligible institution under the Strengthening
Institutions Program (34 CFR part 607), the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program
(34 CFR part 608), or the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program (34 CFR part 609). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The institution requests the increased Federal share as part of its regular FWS funding application for that year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide for a separate ``Community Service Learning program'' under the FWS programs. In an
effort to increase participation in community service activities in the title IV, HEA programs, Congress amended
the statement of purpose for the FWS program to encourage students to participate in community service activities.
The Amendments removed the authority for a separate ``Community Service-Learning program'' and instead require
institutions to employ a percentage of their FWS students in community service jobs. As a result of this change, the
Secretary is proposing to remove &sect;675.28 from the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide for two separate Job Location and Development programs: (1) A regular JLD program to
expand off-campus job opportunities for students enrolled in eligible institutions of higher education who, regardless
of their financial need, want jobs; and (2) a ``Community Services'' JLD program to locate and develop community services
jobs for students with financial need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.31 in accordance with amended section 446 of the HEA to combine the two
programs into one program to expand off-campus job opportunities for students enrolled in eligible institutions,
regardless of their financial need. The Secretary is further proposing to amend &sect;675.31, in accordance with
the amended statement of purpose for all the FWS programs in section 441(a) of the HEA, to include in the statement of
purpose for the JLD program the encouragement of participation in community service activities. Also, in accordance
with amended section 446 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.32 to allow an institution to use
the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the institution's allocation to establish or expand a program to locate and develop
jobs, including community service jobs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments added new section 448 to the HEA to establish the ``Work-Colleges program.'' Congress created this
program to encourage comprehensive work-learning programs and recognize the special nature of institutions that
choose to make work-learning a central part of their educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, institutions that satisfy the definition of ``work-college'' may apply to the Secretary to participate
in the Work-Colleges program. The term ``work-college'' under the statute means an eligible institution that (1)
has been a public or private nonprofit institution with a commitment to community service; (2) has operated a comprehensive
work-learning program for at least two years; (3) requires all resident students who reside on campus to participate
in a comprehensive work-learning program and the provision of services as an integral part of the institution's educational
program and as part of the institution's educational philosophy; and (4) provides students participating in the
comprehensive work-learning program with the opportunity to contribute to their education and to the welfare of
the community as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comprehensive work-learning program does not provide only narrowly career-oriented or job-skill-oriented employment.
It provides work experiences that teach basic habits and attitudes, responsibility, interpersonal relations,
communication, teamwork, self analysis, organizational behavior, problem solving, leadership and other lessons
that are not job specific or career specific. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires that funds made available to work-colleges must be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis from
non-Federal sources. In addition to any amounts appropriated, the statute allows work-colleges to also use FWS program
funds and Federal Perkins Loan funds to provide flexibility in strengthening the self-help-through-work element
in financial aid packaging.

beginning on or after July 1, 1993. The Secretary is proposing to amend this section to incorporate this statutory
change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the Secretary will continue to authorize a Federal share of 100 percent of the FSEOGs awarded

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the
regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the
regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would
the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded
by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading, for example, &sect;674.4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

.) (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful
in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to
understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand
should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small entities affected by these proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary
education. The changes in these regulations will not substantially increase institutions' workload or costs associated
with administering the title IV, HEA programs and, therefore, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Default penalty
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If an institution's cohort default rate meets the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default
reduction plan in accordance with &sect;674.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent, but is less than 25 percent, the institution's
FCC is reduced by 10 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent, but is less than 30 percent, the institution's
FCC is reduced by 30 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cohort default rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The term ``cohort default rate'' means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the
institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current
and former students who enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance at that institution
who default before the end of the following award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining the number of students who default before the end of the following award year, the Secretary excludes
any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation
of the cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan
received for attendance at the institution, the ``cohort default rate'' means the percentage of those current and
former students who entered repayment on loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three most
recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end of the award year immediately following the year
in which they entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has persisted for at least_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly installments; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 270 consecutive days for loans repayable in quarterly installments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency,
contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the institution, in order to avoid default
by the borrower; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) Any loan that is in default, but on which the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan,
or any loan that has been rehabilitated before the end of the following award year is not considered to be in default
for purposes of the cohort default rate calculation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent
repayment or default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the student received the loan that
entered repayment in the award year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Improper servicing or collection means the failure of the institution to comply with subpart C of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Locations of the institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on the first day
of the award year for which the rate is calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution from the date the institution
is notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a free-standing institution, the
Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of the award year for which
a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing institution to a location of another institution,
the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during
the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated
institution and all of its current locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined
number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default
during the applicable award years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort default rate applies
to the new, consolidated institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a location of another institution,
the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during
the applicable award year and the number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the
institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to the respective locations.

and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from the institution under both
the old and new control.

qualifications and size of faculty, and other aspects of its educational program in consultation with its academic
accrediting agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the institution's records regarding the borrower's employer and employer's address as part of the contacts with
the borrower under &sect;674.42(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Obtain information from the borrower regarding references and family members beyond those provided on the loan

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Explain to a prospective student that the student's dissatisfaction with, or nonreceipt of, the educational
services being offered by the institution does not excuse the borrower from repayment of any Federal Perkins Loan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Use a written test and intensive additional counseling for those borrowers who fail the test to ensure the borrower's
comprehension of the terms and conditions of the loan including those described in &sect;&sect;674.16 and 674.42(a)
as part of the initial loan counseling and the exit interview.

shall consider the amount by which the resources exceed the student's financial need by more than the applicable amount
as an overpayment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Washington Dulles Foreign-Trade Zone, Inc., grantee of FTZ 137, has made a request to the Foreign-Trade Zones
(FTZ) Board for a minor modification of the boundary of FTZ 137 pursuant to &sect;400.27(f) of the FTZ Board regulations
(15 CFR Part 400). The grantee is requesting authority to include within the zone project a privately owned public
warehouse facility on a 3-acre parcel located at 110 Terminal Drive, Sterling, Virginia, within the Dulles Airport
Corridor area, some 2 miles from the airport. In exchange, zone status would be relinquished on a parcel (3 acres) located
within the boundary of the existing zone on the airport complex. The warehouse is operated by Victory Van Corporation,
which would offer zone services as part of its public warehousing operation. No authority is requested for manufacturing
or processing activity. The purpose of the change is to provide improved zone public warehousing services in the airport
area while the grantee considers revisions to its longer-term zone plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the request is invited from interested parties. Submissions shall be addressed to the Board's Executive
Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the request will be available for public inspection at the following location: Office of the Executive Secretary,
Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th &amp; Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,
DC 20230.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') has received timely requests, in accordance with section 353.22(a)
(1), (2), and (3) of the Department's regulations, for administrative reviews of antidumping duty orders covering
antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof. The orders cover three classes or
kinds of merchandise: ball bearings (ball), cylindrical roller bearings (cylindrical), and spherical plain bearings
(spherical). Pursuant to section 353.25 of the Department's regulations, we have also received a request to revoke
the order covering ball bearings and parts thereof from Thailand with respect to NMB/Pelmec, the only known producer/exporter
of this merchandise from Thailand. This request is based on the firm's claim that there has been an absence of dumping
on sales of the above subject merchandise for a period of three consecutive years.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a request by the respondents, Akzo Faser A.G. and Akzo Fibers, Inc. (Akzo), producers/importers of
high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany, the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany. The review period is February
20, 1992 through May 31, 1993. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States,
Akzo, and its United States subsidiary/importer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for the period, and we preliminary determine to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the foreign market value (FMV).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results of review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 30, 1992, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the antidumping duty order on high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany (57 FR 29062). On June 7, 1993, the Department
published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notifying interested parties of the opportunity to request an administrative review of high-tenacity rayon filament
yarn from Germany (58 FR 31941). On June 29, 1993, Akzo requested, in accordance with section 353.22(a) of the Commerce
regulations, that we conduct an administrative review for the period February 20, 1992 through May 31, 1993. We published
a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007).

The Department has now conducted a review for this period in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act).

Scope of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product covered by this administrative review is high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany. During the
review period, such merchandise was classifiable under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (HTS) item number 5403.10.30.40. High-tenacity rayon filament yarn is a multifilament single yarn of viscose rayon
with a twist of five turns or more per meter, having a denier of 1100 or greater, and a tenacity greater than 35 centinewtons
per tex. The HTS item number is provided for convenience and U.S. Customs purposes. The written description remains
dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. The review covers Akzo and the period February 20, 1992 through
May 31, 1993 (POR).

United States Price
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating USP, the Department treated Akzo's sales as purchase price (PP), as defined in section 772 of the Act,
because the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. PP was based on the free-on-board
(FOB) price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made adjustments, where applicable, for foreign brokerage
and handling, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, foreign inland insurance,
and U.S. brokerage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made an addition to USP for taxes which were rebated upon exportation. On October 7, 1993, the United States Court
of International Trade (CIT), in

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same
point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see Federal-Mogul,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal-Mogul
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision, the Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the U.S. price at the
same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department
has also adjusted the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included in FMV to account for expenses that are later
deducted from USP and FMV. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary
to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where
no margins would exist if not taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without the adjustments, margins would be artificially increased because both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After deductions are made for these expenses, the amount of tax included in FMV and the
USP tax adjustment still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent
upon a difference between USP and FMV, but rather is the result of the price of the U.S. merchandise containing more
expenses than the price of the foreign market merchandise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's policy of avoiding the creation of artificial margins is in accordance with court decisions. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the application of the USP tax adjustment under
section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP (

 United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made
to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax
included in FMV (

United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991)). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department requested that Akzo submit information relating to all exporter's sales price (ESP)
sales made during the POR. The Department analyzed data submitted by Akzo and determined that the ESP sales reported
were entered and liquidated prior to the date of the Department's preliminary determination of sales at less-than-fair-value
(LTFV). Because this merchandise was entered prior to the date of the preliminary determination, it was not covered
by this order (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

we have excluded these sales from this review.

No other adjustments to USP were claimed or allowed.

Akzo had sufficient home market sales of the subject merchandise during the POR. Therefore, the sales of high-tenacity
rayon filament yarn in the home market served as a viable basis for calculating FMV.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on findings in the LTFV investigation that home market sales of the subject merchandise were made by Akzo at prices
below the cost of production (COP), the Department conducted a cost investigation for this administrative review.
We examined whether home market sales were made below cost in substantial quantities over an extended period of time,
and whether such sales were made at prices which permitted recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time
in the normal course of trade. We calculated Akzo's COP on a model-specific basis as the sum of all reported materials
costs, labor expenses, factory overhead, selling expenses, net interest expense, and revised general and administrative
expenses. We reallocated general and administrative costs as a percentage of cost of goods sold. We compared COP to
home market prices, net of movement charges, third-party payments, packing, rebates, and discounts. Based upon
this comparison, we found that there were sales below cost.

Where we determined that less than 10 percent of the home market sales of rayon yarn of a particular model were sold at
prices below the COP, we did not disregard any sales of that model in our calculation of FMV. If 10 percent or more, but
not more than 90 percent, of the home market sales of a particular model of rayon yarn were below cost, we excluded the
below-cost home market sales prices from our calculation of FMV, provided that these below-cost home market sales
were made over an extended period of time. For those models where more than 90 percent of the home market sales were made
below cost over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of those models from our calculation
of FMV and used the constructed value of those models as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether sales below cost were made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in
which sales below cost occurred for a particular model to the number of months in which that model was sold. If the model
was sold in fewer than three months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there were below-cost sales of that
model in each month sold. If a model was sold in three or more months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there
were sales below cost in at least three of the months in which the model was sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo has not submitted information indicating that any of its sales below cost were made at prices which would have
permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,'' as required by
section 773(b)(2) of the Act. Therefore, we have no basis for concluding that the costs of production of such sales
have been recovered within a reasonable period of time. As a result of our investigation, we disregarded Akzo's below-cost
sales made over an extended period of time.

We used constructed value (CV) as FMV for those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient sales of the comparison
home-market model at or above the COP. We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We made an adjustment
to general and administrative expenses based on our finding that Akzo had allocated general and administrative costs
to different product groups based on specific allocation methodologies. The costs reported were general in nature
and related to all operations, and we allocated them to all of Akzo's product lines. In addition, we summed the cost
of materials, indirect selling expenses, direct selling expenses, revised general and administrative expenses,
net interest expenses, and imputed credit. In our calculation of the selling, general, and administrative expenses
(SG&amp;A), where the sum of the actual selling expenses and the revised general and administrative expenses was
less than the statutory minimum of 10 percent of the cost of manufacturing (COM), we calculated SG&amp;A as 10 percent
of the COM. Where the actual profits were less than the statutory minimum of 8 percent of COM plus SG&amp;A, we calculated
profit as 8 percent of the sum of COM plus SG&amp;A. We adjusted CV for selling, credit, and packing expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those models that had sufficient above-cost sales, the Department calculated FMV using home market prices based
on the FOB price to unrelated purchasers. Where applicable, we made adjustments for inland freight (post-sale),
inland insurance, packing, discounts, other discounts, interest revenue, rebates, and third party payments. We
made adjustments for differences in technical services expenses and credit. We also made adjustments for differences
in the physical characteristics of merchandise. The Department also made an adjustment to the amount of consumption
taxes included in FMV in accordance with the Department's aforementioned tax adjustment methodology.

 822 F. Supp. 782 (1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for
correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for
the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Thus, the ``all others''
rate for the purposes of this review will be 24.58 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice
of LTFV investigation by the Department (57 FR 21770).

of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

 On March 8, 1994, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the
antidumping duty order on industrial phosphoric acid from Israel (59 FR 10787). The review periods are August 1, 1991
through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. These reviews involve Haifa Chemicals, Ltd., a manufacturer/exporter
of this merchandise to the United States. We have now completed these reviews and determine the margin to be 6.82 percent

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 8, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on industrial phosphoric acid
from Israel (59 FR 10787) covering the periods August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31,
1993, the fifth and sixth review periods respectively. The review of Rotem Fertilizers (Rotem) was terminated in
the preliminary results of these reviews (59 FR 10787) because Rotem was determined to be the successor to Negev Phosphates,
Ltd. (Negev), a company that was revoked from the antidumping order in the final results of the changed circumstances
review. The Department has now completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of industrial phosphoric acid (IPA). This product is classifiable
under item number 2809.20.00 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review periods are August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. These reviews involve
Haifa Chemicals Ltd. (Haifa), an Israeli manufacturer/exporter to the United States of the subject merchandise.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Haifa reported that it did not have any shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States during these review
periods. We subsequently confirmed with the United States Customs Service that there were no entries of this merchandise
to the United States by Haifa during these review periods. Therefore, we are using the rate found in the previous review
for this company for cash deposit purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(57 FR 38471; August 25, 1992). Because Haifa did not respond to the Department's questionnaire in that review, it
was assigned a rate of 6.82 percent, the highest margin assigned to any company in a previous review or in the investigation.

(2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews,
a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate
will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) cash deposits
for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all other'' rate of 1.77 percent. This is the rate established
during the LTFV investigation.

 On June 7, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') overturned the determination by the Department
of Commerce (``the Department'') that the benefit of Saarstahl AG's subsidization, by reason of forgiveness of debts,
was passed through to Dillinger Hutte Saarstahl AG (``DHS'') after Saarstahl was privatized.

 58 FR 6233 (January 27, 1993), the Department determined that subsidies previously bestowed on Saarstahl in the form
of debt forgiveness passed through to DHS, a newly formed holding company of which Saarstahl became a subsidiary.
The Department's determination was challenged. The Department subsequently requested, and was granted, a remand
in order to reconsider its final determinations. On remand, the Department adopted its reasoning from

893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.

and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in

Accordingly, the Department will continue to suspend liquidation pending the expiration of the period of appeal
or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision. Absent an appeal or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court
decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the countervailing duty order will be revoked effective June 17, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 7, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') overturned the determination by the Department
of Commerce (``the Department'') that United Engineering Steels, Ltd. (``UES'') was being subsidized by reason
of subsidies previously bestowed on a government-owned company which sold one of its productive units to UES in an
arm's-length transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60425) proposing withdrawal of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 71, because the technical
specifications that they adopt are obsolete and are no longer supported by industry. NIST also stated that if FIPS
71 were withdrawn, FIPS 78 would be withdrawn as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to
this standard was reviewed by NIST. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approved the withdrawal
of FIPS 71 and 78, and prepared a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available
for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert
C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed FIPS defines general purpose profiles that can be used by both vendors and users to specify exact requirements
for how various products will fit into an SQL environment. An SQL environment is an integrated data processing environment
in which heterogeneous products, all supporting some aspect of FIPS 127, SQL, are able to communicate with one another
and provide shared access to data and data operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access
control mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The profiles in this proposed FIPS will enable Federal agencies to specify a subset of FIPS 127 to provide limited SQL
access to legacy databases, or to support SQL gateways to specialized data managers such as Geographic Information
Systems, full-text document management systems, or object database management systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the announcement
section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications section
from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building,
room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816. An electronic version of this specification is

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Name of Standard. SQL Environments (FIPS PUB XXX).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Explanation. An SQL environment is an integrated data processing environment in which heterogeneous products,
all supporting some aspect of the FIPS SQL standard (FIPS PUB 127), are able to communicate with one another and provide
shared access to data and data operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access control
mechanisms. Some components in an SQL environment will be full-function SQL implementations that conform to an entire
level of FIPS SQL and support all of its required clauses for schema definition, data manipulation, transaction management,
integrity constraints, access control, and schema information. Other components in an SQL environment may be specialized
data repositories, or graphical user interfaces and report writers, that support selected portions of the SQL standard
and thereby provide a degree of integration between themselves and other products in the same SQL environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This FIPS PUB is the beginning of a continuing effort to define appropriate conformance profiles that can be used by
both vendors and users to specify exact requirements for how various products fit into an SQL environment. The emphasis
in this first FIPS for SQL Environments is to specify general purpose, SQL external repository interface (SQL/ERI)
profiles for non-SQL data repositories. These profiles specify how a subset of the SQL standard can be used to provide
limited SQL access to legacy databases, or to support SQL gateways to specialized data managers such as Geographic
Information Systems (GIS), full-text document management systems, or object database management systems. All
of the profiles specified herein are for server-side products, that is, products that control persistent data and
provide an interface for users access to that data. Subsequent versions of this FIPS PUB may specify SQL environment
profiles for client-side products, that is, products that access data and then present that data in graphical or report-writer
style to an end user, or process the data in some other way on behalf of the end user.

7. Related Documents. SQL Environment specifications will often depend upon existing Database Language SQL standards
(see Cross Index above) and upon emerging SQL and SQL Multimedia standards. The following items identify formal ISO/IEC
international standards projects for which preliminary specifications and base documents exist, but where the
development effort has not yet reached a complete and stable stage (i.e. the Committee Draft (CD) stage). As these
specifications mature and move through the standards process, they can referenced more reliably in procurement
requirements.

section of the SQL/ERI Server Profiles specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Objective. The primary objective of this FIPS PUB for SQL Environments is to specify SQL profiles that can be used
by Federal departments and agencies to support integration of legacy databases and other non-SQL data repositories
into an SQL environment. The intent is to provide a high level of control over a diverse collection of legacy or specialized
data resources. An SQL environment allows an organization to obtain many of the advantages of SQL without requiring
a large, complex, and error-prone conversion effort; instead, the organization can evolve, in a controlled manner,
to a new environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicability. This standard is applicable in any situation where it is desirable to integrate a client-side productivity
tool or a server-side data repository into an SQL environment. It is a non-mandatory standard that may be invoked on
a case-by-case basis subject to the integration objectives of the procuring department or agency. It is particularly
suitable for specifying limited SQL interfaces to legacy databases or to specialized data repositories not under
the control of a full-function SQL database management system. It can be used along with other procurement information
to specify SQL interface requirements for a wide range of data management procurements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One special area of application envisioned for this standard is Electronic Commerce, a National Challenge Application
area of the National Information Infrastructure. The primary objective of Electronic Commerce is to integrate communications,
data management, and security services in a distributed processing environment, thereby allowing business applications
within different organizations to interoperate and exchange information automatically. At the data management
level, electronic commerce requires a logically integrated database of diverse data stored in geographically separated
data banks under the management and control of heterogeneous database management systems. An over-riding requirement
is that these diverse data managers be able to communicate with one another and provide shared access to data and data
operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access control mechanisms. FIPS SQL provides
a powerful database language for data definition, data manipulation, and integrity management to satisfy many of
these requirements. It is unrealistic to expect that every data manager involved in electronic commerce will conform
to even the Entry SQL level of the FIPS SQL standard; however, it is not unrealistic to require that they support a limited
SQL interface, even a read-only interface, provided by one of the SQL/ERI Server profiles. New procurements to add
components to the National Information Infrastructure, or to upgrade existing components, can define the necessary
SQL schemas and point to appropriate SQL/ERI Server profiles as procurement requirements.

Further detail on each of these potential application areas can be found in Section 8, ``Applicability'', of the FIPS
specification of SQL Environments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Specifications. See the Specifications for SQL Environments_SQL External Repository Interface (SQL/ERI)_Server
Profiles (Affixed).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Implementation. Implementation of this standard involves four areas of consideration: the effective date,
acquisition of conforming implementations, interpretation, and validation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.1&blank;Effective date. This publication is effective immediately upon publication. Since it is a nonmandatory
specification, based on the established FIPS SQL standard, and used at the discretion of individual Federal procurements,
no transitional period or delayed effective date is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.2&blank;Acquisition. All conforming implementations of a specific SQL/ERI profile will support some aspects
of the FIPS SQL standard. However, such implementations will not normally be full function database management systems
and conformance will often be dependent upon SQL schema definitions and other requirements provided as part of each
individual procurement. In most cases, a procurement will not be able to simply point to an SQL/ERI profile and demand
conformance to it. Instead, successful procurements will normally use an appropriate SQL/ERI profile, together
with an application-specific schema definition, as one aspect of overall procurement requirements. In many cases,
vendors of products that provide a limited SQL interface will define their interfaces in terms of a fixed SQL schema
definition. In those cases, procurements can point to the vendor-provided schema definition and to an appropriate
SQL/ERI profile as a procurement requirement. In some cases, especially in those situations where schema definitions
and requirements are not known in advance, a request for a proposal (RFP) many require that an SQL schema, and adherence
to one of the SQL/ERI Server profiles, be presented as part of the response proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.3&blank;Interpretation. NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding specifications and requirements
of the FIPS for SQL Environments, and issues official interpretations as needed. Procedures for interpretations
are specified in FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3. All questions about the interpretation of FIPS SQL Environments should be addressed
to:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THE FCA BOARD HEREBY ADOPTS THE FOLLOWING POLICY STATEMENT:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA shall develop regulations consistent with its authorities under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act), as amended,
and other relevant statutes. It is the FCA Board's philosophy to promulgate regulations that are necessary to implement
the law and to promote the safety and soundness of the Farm Credit System (System). In general, the Board's regulatory
objective will be to:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Protect the public, the investors, and the customer/shareholders of the System in an effort to create an environment
whereby customer/shareholders and investors can take advantage of the System's strength and rely on its future viability
with confidence.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The FCA Board believes that safe and sound operations of System institutions will promote: (a) Investor confidence
in System debt securities, which works to ensure adequate funds at reasonable rates for lending to customer/shareholders;
and, (b) customer/shareholder confidence in each cooperatively owned System institution, which works to ensure
customers and capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To effectively achieve its objective, the FCA will do the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The FCA will promulgate regulations only as required by law, as necessary to interpret the law, or as necessary to
promote the safe and sound operation of System institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The FCA will work to eliminate outdated regulations and ensure that its regulations implement the purposes of the
law without unnecessary burden or cost. The FCA Board recognizes that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify
and that some are qualitative, but essential to consider. When there is a significant cost impact, the FCA will consider
the risk or problem, as well as the costs associated with a regulatory solution, from the perspective of the customer/shareholder,
the System institution, the investor, and the regulator, including when appropriate a numerically-based cost analysis.
In choosing among alternatives, the FCA will adopt its regulatory approach based upon a reasoned determination that
the benefits of the intended regulations justify their cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The FCA will strive to ensure that each regulation has a well-defined objective. Regulations will address specific
identified risks or problems. The Board will consider these risks from the perspective of the customer/shareholder,
the System institution, the investor, and the regulator. Preambles to regulations will explain the FCA Board's rationale
for the regulatory solution adopted. Consistent with its statutory authority, the FCA will establish a regulatory
environment that grants System institutions the business flexibility to offer a full range of high quality, low cost
credit and other services to customer/shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The FCA's regulations shall, to the extent feasible, specify performance criteria and objectives rather than
operational methods for achieving its purposes. The FCA recognizes that it does not manage the day-to-day activities
of System institutions. Operational constraints that are imposed by regulations should be based on specific statutory
requirements or the achievement of regulatory objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In setting regulatory priorities, the FCA, to the extent it has discretion, will give high priority to issues that
pose the greatest risk within the Farm Credit System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The FCA will carefully consider policy positions of the other financial regulators to determine whether or not
consistency facilitates the objectives of the Act. The FCA Board recognizes that differences between the System
and non-agricultural lenders will at times warrant different approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The FCA will draft its regulations and policy statements to be clear and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing
the potential for ambiguity, uncertainty, and resultant litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The FCA will utilize appropriate innovative approaches to seeking the public's perspective regarding regulatory
proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA Board will take these principles into consideration as its considers the need for and the content of new regulatory
initiatives and as it reviews existing regulations to determine their continuing need and effectiveness. The FCA
Board is mindful that most regulatory activities will involve competing considerations and is committed to considering
and weighing those competing considerations and arriving at thoughtful regulatory judgments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OBM) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information
Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior
to submission of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following:
(1) Type of review requested, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection; (4) The affected
public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public comment at the
address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Patrick J. Sherrill at the address specified above.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a subsequent license for the existing Hayward Hydroelectric Project, located on the Namekagon
River, in the City of Hayward, Sawyer County, Wisconsin and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for
the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental effects of the existing
project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate protection or enhancement measures, would
not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Take notice that on June 13, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard
Illinois, 60148, filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;001 an amendment to its application filed in Docket No.
CP93&hyph;745&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, for authorization to increase Natural's
maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's storage fields, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which
is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural indicates that in its original application, it proposed to construct and operate 16 injection/withdrawal
wells, and associated piping and meters. Natural further states that it proposed to replace one compressor and two
segments of storage field lines, in its original application. Natural states that the proposed construction, operation
and/or replacement of facilities at two of its storage fields in Iowa, and one of its storage fields in Texas was designed
to increase the maximum daily deliverability from its storage operations by an additional 250 MMcf per day, at an estimated
construction cost of $14,650,000 for the jurisdictional facilities and approximately $6,137,000 for the non-jurisdictional
facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural is amending its application, by deleting its proposal to construct and operate all jurisdictional facilities
proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;000. Natural further proposes to amend its original filing to this proceeding
by increasing its maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's existing storage fields by 175 MMcf per day original
proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;745&hyph;000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said amendment should on or before July 1, 1994,
file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance
with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR &sect;&sect;385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR &sect;157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be
considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein
must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have heretofore filed need
not file again.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 6, 1993, the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy issued a Decision and Order setting forth
final refund procedures to distribute the monies in the escrow account established in accordance with the terms of
an Agreed Judgment entered into between the Department of Energy and Whitaker Oil Company. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
See Whitaker Oil Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 23 DOE &para;85,054 (1993), 58 FR 28009 (May 12, 1993). That Decision established a filing deadline 90 days from the
date the Whitaker Decision and Order appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, August 10, 1993 was the deadline for the submission of refund applications for direct restitution by purchasers
of Whitaker's kerosene, toluene, xylene, and diesel fuel. 23 DOE at 88,138.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Hearings and Appeals began accepting refund applications in the Whitaker proceeding on June 8, 1993.
All of the Applications for Refund filed in the Whitaker proceeding have been considered and resolved. Furthermore,
in view of the extended period of time that has transpired since the commencement of the proceeding, we have concluded
that all eligible applicants have been provided with more than ample time to file. Accordingly, as of the date of issuance
of this Notice, the proceeding established to distribute funds from the escrow account maintained pursuant to the
Agreed Judgment entered into between the DOE and Whitaker Oil Company is closed. Any unclaimed funds remaining after
all meritorious claims have been paid will be made available for indirect restitution pursuant to the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &sect;4501.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to the EPA's ``Statement of Policy; Microbial
Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act''
of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received from Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419. The purpose
of the proposed testing is to evaluate the efficacy of five genetically modified strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas fluorescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 MOCG-0134 which are designated as MOCG-0134-137, MOCG-0134-E11, MOCG-0134-8392, MOCG-0134-2215, and MOCG-0134-6720.
The genetic modifications have been limited to the use of plasmid and transposon vectors to deliver genetic information
that is resident within the wild-type strain (MOCG-0134). Testing would be conducted to determine the efficacy of
these strains for control of certain soil-borne pathogens of cotton, vegetables (including potatoes and green beans)
and various ornamental plants. The proposed field tests would be conducted at Ciba-Geigy research stations located
in Florida, Mississippi, New York, and California on a total area of less than 10 acres. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A previous notification was submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corp. on March 22, 1993. The purpose of the proposed testing was
to evaluate the efficacy of a genetically-modified strain (CGA-267356) of an indigenous strain of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas fluorescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, strain MOCG-0134, isolated from roots of cotton plants grown in Texas, for the control of soil-borne pathogens of
cotton, vegetables and ornamentals. The review of that notification was not completed because there was insufficient
information to allow for adequate evaluation by the public in the releasable version of the notification.

on up to 200,000 acres of cotton in Louisiana. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of
this request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the Applicant, BAW is an occasional pest of cotton in Louisiana which seldom causes economic damage.
However, under favorable environmental conditions, BAW populations can increase to extremely high levels and cause
severe economic losses. In 1993, a severe outbreak cost affected Louisiana cotton producers $15 to $85 per acre. According
to the Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available
for use and another outbreak occurs, the Applicant claims that yield losses of 10 to 20 percent may occur, resulting
in significant economic losses for affected growers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 40,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 200,000 acres of cotton.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to Section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue specific
exemptions for the use of imidacloprid on broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and head and leaf lettuce to control the
silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of these requests.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whiteflies have been a problem in the ``desert-cropping systems'' in California and Arizona for some time, but in
1990, a new strain (possibly a new species) was discovered, which appears to be much more prolific than the standard
strain, and resistant to many insecticides. Whiteflies are common on many wild and cultivated crops such as tomatoes,
cotton, cucurbits and solanaceae. The Applicant states that this new strain caused devastation to many crops in 1991
in California's Imperial Valley, with crop losses over $120 million. Whiteflies cause direct damage through feeding
activities and indirectly through the production of honeydew which enhances sooty mold development. The Applicant
claims that adequate control of this pest is not being achieved with the currently registered compounds. The Applicant
claims that without control of this pest, growers could expect up to 50 percent yield losses, causing significant
economic losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.3016 lb. active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product)
per acre with a maximum of one application, at or near planting, per crop season on a total of 62,000 acres of the above-listed
crops. For each of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore,
the acreage could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant
proposed to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per
acre. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 31,000 lbs. of active ingredient,
or 15,500 gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named
crops, and exemptions were issued for this use in California last year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile,
available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 25,000 acres of cotton
in Georgia. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the Applicant, BAW has historically been a late-season pest of cotton, particularly in drought years.
However, the use of organophosphate insecticides in the Boll Weevil Eradication Program has disrupted the natural
biological control of BAW, causing it to become a serious, season-long problem in certain years. According to the
Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available
for use and a severe outbreak occurs, the Applicant claims that yield losses of up to 100 percent are possible in some
fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 10,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 25,000 acres of cotton.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Consumer Advisory Council was established in 1976 at the direction of Congress to advise the Federal Reserve Board
on the exercise of its duties under the Consumer Credit Protection Act and on other consumer-related matters. The
Council by law represents the interests both of consumers and of the financial community. Members serve three-year
terms that are staggered to provide the Council with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New members will be selected for terms beginning January 1, 1995, to replace members whose terms expire this year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nominations should include the address and telephone number of the nominee, information about past and present positions
held, and a description of special knowledge, interests or experience related to consumer credit or other consumer
financial services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Persons may nominate themselves as well as other candidates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is interested in candidates who have some familiarity with consumer financial services and candidates
who are willing to express their viewpoints. Candidates do not have to be experts on all levels of consumer financial
services, but they should possess some basic knowledge of the area. In addition, they should be able to make the necessary
time commitment to prepare for and attend meetings (usually two days long including committee meetings) three times
a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the appointments, the Board will seek to complement the qualifications of continuing Council members in
terms of affiliation and geographic representation, and to ensure the representation of women and minority groups.
The Board expects to announce its selection of new members by year-end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds were appropriated for drug-related security retrofitting for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects
by Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD intends to provide six million dollars to Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation owners who apply and are approved

decisions regarding approved application will be made on a first come first served basis until the available funding
has been depleted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Justification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Explain the circumstances that make the collection of information necessary. Include the identification of any
legal or administrative requirements that necessitate the collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress has appropriated six million dollars for Fiscal Year 1994 for special adjustments to cover the costs of drug-related
security measures at selected Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects. The statutory authority for special
adjustments to Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Contract Rents is in Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act
of 1937 as amended by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 at Section 542. Section 8(c)(2)(B)
states the following: ``Where the Secretary determines that a project assisted under this section is located in a
community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent and the project's operating, maintenance,
and capital repair expenses have been substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related
activity, the Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations
for contract amendments for this purpose), on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly
rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the project rents, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital
repairs, and reserves required for the owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to the Secretary for addressing the
problem of drug-related criminal activity.'' Form HUD&hyph;52662, Owner Application, Funds for Special Adjustment
for Drug-Related Security Retrofitting, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program, provides for owners of Section
8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects to apply for Fiscal Year 1994 funds for special rent adjustments for security.
Owner application is voluntary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Indicate how, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used and the consequence to Federal program or
policy activities if the collection of information was not conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected on Form HUD&hyph;52662 is to be used by Housing Agencies administering Moderate Rehabilitation
Programs and HUD Field Office staff to evaluate the eligibility and need of project owners applying for the funds for
special adjustments for security, and as a basis for assigning funds. If this collection of information was not conducted,
the Department would be unable to assign Fiscal Year 1994 funds for special adjustments for security for Moderate
Rehabilitation projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Describe any consideration of the use of improved information technology to reduce burden and any technical or
legal obstacles to reducing burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form HUD&hyph;52662 will collect information by Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract Number. Field Office
staff will be able to check information on the incoming HUD&hyph;52662 by using the newly available Control Files
System (CFS) containing Moderate Rehabilitation HAP Contract information. CFS will reduce the burden to Field Office
staff in evaluating the information in the HUD&hyph;52662.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Describe efforts to identify duplication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not collecting this data through any other information collection mechanism. Owners are not asked
to provide data of Form HUD&hyph;52662. Owners are not asked to provide data of Form HUD&hyph;52662 that can be obtained
from other HUD computerized files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Show specifically why any similar information already available cannot be used or modified for use for the purpose(2)
described in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar information (description of criminal activity in the neighborhood of the Moderate Rehabilitation project;
impact of the drug-related criminal activity on the project's operating, maintenance and capital repair expenses;
owner's strategy to address the problem of drug-related criminal activity; and security items needed) is not already
available from other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If the collection of information involves small businesses or other small entities, describe the methods used to
minimize burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information may involve small businesses of other small entities that own Moderate Rehabilitation
projects. These entities are under no obligation to complete the application, and will do so on a voluntary basis if
they believe they can benefit from the funds. Form HUD&hyph;52662 takes no more than three hours for an owner to complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Describe the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection were conducted less frequently.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection will occur only in years in which Congress has appropriated funds for special adjustments for security
for Moderate Rehabilitation projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Explain any special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the
guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information collection does not violate 5 CFR 1320.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Describe efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on the availability of data, frequency
of collection, the clarity of instructions and record-keeping, disclosure, or reporting format (if any), and on
the data elements to be recorded, disclosed, or reported. (Consultation should occur at least once every 3 years.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the supporting statement, provide: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The names and telephone numbers of those consulted and the year in which the consultation took place. Indicate the
agencies, companies, State or local governments, or other organizations represented by those consulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A summary of any major problems that could not be resolved during consultation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A description of other public contacts and opportunities for public comment, and a summary of the comments received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parties outside the agency who would have an interest in commenting on Form HUD&hyph;52662 are Housing Agencies
(HAs) administering Moderate Rehabilitation Programs and Moderate Rehabilitation project owners. Since the form
must be approved for use in assigning funds appropriated for the current fiscal year, time does not permit the opportunity
for HAs and owners to comment. HAs and owners have expressed interest to the Department in having a mechanism for funding
special adjustments for security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Describe any assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents and the basis for the assurance in statute,
regulation, or agency policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8 owners who choose to use Form HUD&hyph;52662 to apply for special adjustments for security are accustomed
to providing information on the nature of project operations through their ongoing participation in the Section
8 Program. HAs and HUD staff are aware of many of the particulars of the ownership, financial and physical conditions
of projects under HAP Contract. The additional information requested on Form HUD&hyph;52662 regarding drug-related
criminal activity and its impact on the project is considered non-confidential and customary under the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Provide additional justification for any questions of a sensitive nature, such as sexual behavior and attitudes,
religious beliefs, and other matters that are commonly considered private. This justification should include the
reasons why the agency considers the questions necessary, the specific uses to be made of the information, the explanation
to be given to persons from whom the information is requested, and any steps to be taken to obtain their consent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no questions of this nature in the collection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Provide estimates of annualized cost to the Federal Government and to the respondents. Also provide a description
of the method use to estimate cost, which should include quantification of hours, operational expenses (such as equipment,
overhead, printing, and support staff), and any other expense that would not have been incurred without the paperwork
burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An owner who chooses to use the form will spend approximately three (3) hours completing the form. Housing Agency review
of the form will take approximately one (1) hour. HUD Field Office review of the form will take approximately one (1)
hour. This process will take place no more than once a year for funding purposes; Fiscal Year 1994 is the first year such
funding has occurred, and it is not know whether future fiscal years will provide another opportunity for owners to
apply for these funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Provide estimates of the burden of the collection of information. The statement should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide number of respondents, frequency of response, annual burden, and an explanation of how the burden was estimated.
Unless directed to do so, agencies should not make special survey to obtain information on which to base burden estimates.
Consultation with a few potential respondents is desirable. If the burden on respondents is expected to vary widely
because of differences in activity, size, or complexity, show the range of estimated burden, and explain the reasons
for the variance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the request for approval is for more than one form, provide burden estimates for each form for which approval is sought
and summarize the burdens on the SF 83. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proposed collection of information was not included in the agency's Information Collection Budget (ICB) or
if the burden show on the SF 83 is different from that in the ICB, explain the difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two hundred Moderate Rehabilitation owners are expected to apply for the special adjustment for security in Fiscal
Year 1994. The annual ``burden'' will be once per year, if Congress provides appropriations after the current fiscal
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Explain reasons for changes in burden, including the need for any increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a new information collection requirement, since this is the first time Congress has appropriated funds for
this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. For collections of information whose results are planned to be published for statistical use, outline plans for
tabulation, statistical analysis, and publication. Provide the time schedule for the entire project, including
beginning and ending dates of the collection of information, completion of report, publication dates, and other
actions.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of land Management (BLM) is proposing to amend the Caliente Management Framework Plan (MFP) and the Nellis
Air Force Range Resources Plan (RP) to analyze a proposed withdrawal by the Nellis Air Force Base. The withdrawal would
involve 3,972 acres of public land in the White Sides Area of the BLM's Caliente Resource Area, Lincoln County, Nevada.
This amendment is proposed to be an environmental assessment (EA) level amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 30 day scoping period is being conducted to give the public an opportunity to comment on this proposed amendment and
the following tentative issues: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4)
Access. In addition to the proposed withdrawal and the no action alternative, the public is also invited to suggest
alternatives to be analyzed in this amendment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed withdrawal of the White Sides area, located adjacent to the Nellis Air Force Range, is to
provide a security buffer to the Nellis Air Force Range.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The White Sides area is currently managed by the Caliente MFP. The adjacent Nellis Air Force Range is withdrawn for
military purposes (see Public Laws 99&hyph;606 and 100&hyph;338) and its natural and cultural resources are managed
by the BLM through the Nellis Air Force Range Resource Plan (RP). If this area is to be withdrawn, its management would
be similar to that of this RP. Therefore, it is proposed that the Caliente MFP be amended to not include the management
of the subject 3,972 acres and the Nellis Air Force Range RP be amended to include the management of the subject 3,972
acres. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of resources that may be changed by this amendment include: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle
use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4) Access. Thus, they become tentative issues that will be addressed in one or more
of the alternatives of the amendment. Issue 1. Oil and gas leasing: The area is currently open to leasing under the Caliente
MFP Minerals decision 2.0. The proposed withdrawal could impact oil and gas exploration and development. Issue 2.
Locatable minerals: The subject area is open to locatable mining under the Caliente Minerals decision 1.1. The proposed
withdrawal would close the land under the mining laws. Issue 3. Recreation/Off-Road Vehicle Use: The subject area
is currently open to sight-seeing, recreational, and off-road vehicle use under Caliente MFP Recreation Decision
R&hyph;2. The proposed withdrawal would close the area to public access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment will analyze the impacts of several alternatives to the proposed withdrawal, including the no action
alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal, state and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations who are interested in/or affected by aspects
of the proposed amendment and environmental assessment, are invited to participate in this planning process. Comments
and recommendations will be accepted only on those subjects being addressed by this amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of section 337 violations in the importation,
the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of sports sandals that infringe
three claims of U.S. Letters Patent 4,793,075, on September 8, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 14, 1994, Deckers and Brown filed a joint motion to terminate the investigation on the basis of a settlement
agreement, a consent order agreement, and a proposed consent order. The ALJ issued an ID granting the joint motion
and terminating the investigation as to Brown on April 19, 1994. No agency or public comments concerning the ID were
filed. Deckers filed a petition for review of the ID on the grounds that the ID raised issues not properly before the
ALJ. The Commission determined to review the ID and remand it to the ALJ for clarification of the parties' intent concerning
their stipulation of patent validity on May 20, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 306 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate production quotas for
controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated to the Administrator
of the DEA pursuant to &sect;0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator, in turn, has redelegated
this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 13, 1994, a notice of the proposed revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for certain controlled substances
in Schedules I and II was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 17568). All interested parties were invited to comment on or object to these proposed aggregate production
quotas on or before May 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several companies commented that the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for amphetamine, codeine (for sale),
d-desoxyephedrine, opium, oxycodone (for sale), pentobarbital and secobarbital were insufficient to provide
for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industry needs of the United States, for export requirements
and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEA has reviewed the involved companies' 1993 year-end inventories, their initial 1994 manufacturing quotas,
1994 export requirements and their actual and projected 1994 sales. Based on this data, the DEA has adjusted the revised
1994 aggregate production quotas for amphetamine, codeine (for sale), d-desoxyephedrine, opium, oxycodone (for
sale), pentobarbital and secobarbital to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding levorphanol, methylphenidate, phencyclidine and sufentanil, DEA has received updated information
from several manufacturers which shows the necessity for adjustments of the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas
for these controlled substances. The adjustments will provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research
and industrial needs of the United States and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. The DEA has
adjusted the 1994 revised aggregate production quotas for levorphanol, methylphenidate, phencyclidine and sufentanil
accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The establishment of aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law
and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers,
their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has
determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by &sect;0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quotas, expressed in grams of anhydrous acid or base, be established
as follows:

<DOCTITLE>Linwood T. Townsend, D.D.S.; Denial of Application</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Linwood Thomas Townsend, D.D.S., Respondent, at 1285 N.E. 148th Street, North
Miami, Florida. The Order to Show Cause proposed to deny his application for registration executed on November 8,
1991, and filed with the DEA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order alleged that Respondent's registration with DEA
would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent requested a hearing and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following
prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Miami, Florida on October 13, 1993. On January 18, 1994, Judge Tenney
issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommended Ruling. Neither party filed exceptions to the administrative
law judge's opinion and recommended decision and, on February 18, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted
the record to the Acting Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant
to 21 CFR &sect;1316.67, hereby enters his final order in this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that in 1977 Respondent obtained a license to practice dentistry in Florida. On
May 30, 1980, Respondent was issued DEA Registration, AT9228708. On November 17, 1980, Respondent was issued a second
Certificate of Registration. On November 30, 1981, Respondent's DEA registration expired, and was never renewed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From November 1981 through November 1991, Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances with the expired
registration number. A DEA Investigator conducted a survey of 11 pharmacies in the Miami area for prescriptions for
controlled substances issued by the Respondent. The survey included prescriptions issued between January 1989
and November 1991. The Investigator recovered approximately 575 prescriptions for controlled substances issued
by the Respondent during that period. Respondent did not possess a valid DEA registration during that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the DEA administrative hearing, Respondent testified that he thought his registration was transferable and that
at that time he did not know that he was doing anything wrong. Respondent further testified that once he became aware
of the need for a new DEA registration, he immediately submitted an application to DEA. Additionally, the Respondent
said that he had not prescribed controlled substances since that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent also represented that during the period in question, he was employed by institutions which were part of
the public health service, and was therefore exempt from DEA registration under 21 CFR &sect;1301.25. The administrative
law judge found that Respondent's claim was without any factual foundation. The Deputy Administrator agrees. The
term ``public health service'' as set forth in &sect;1301.25, refers to the United States Public Health Service.
None of the institutions at which Respondent was employed was part of the Public Health Service as contemplated by
&sect;1301.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge additionally found that on February 4, 1988, in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial
Circuit in Dade County, Florida, Respondent was convicted upon his plea of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
nolo contendere 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to filing false Medicaid claims. He was placed on eighteen months probation and ordered to pay restitution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as a result of the conviction, on May 13, 1988, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services terminated Respondent from further participation in the Florida Medicaid program. By letter dated June
24, 1988, the United States Department of Health and Human Services excluded Respondent from participation in the
Medicare program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a), for a period of five years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge further found that on November 3, 1988, the Department of Professional Regulation,
Board of Dentistry (Board), filed an 18 count administrative complaint against Respondent. The complaint alleged
that from March 1985 to May 1987, Respondent billed the Florida Medicaid Department for services that he did not render
and filed false documents pertaining to the billing of these services to patients. With the exception of two counts,
Respondent did not dispute the allegations in the complaint. Consequently, on February 27, 1989, the Board entered
its final order in which it adopted the allegations in the administrative complaint as findings of fact. The order
placed Respondent's state dental license on suspension for three months, two months stayed. Following the suspension,
Respondent's license was placed on five years probation and Respondent was ordered to take 24 hours of instruction
in ethics and perform 500 hours of community service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board filed an administrative complaint and an amended administrative complaint against the Respondent on March
14, 1990 and December 19, 1990, respectively. The amended complaint alleged that the Respondent failed to meet the
minimum standard of care in diagnosis and treatment of his patients and failed to keep records which justified his
course of treatment. A stipulation entered into by the parties was approved and adopted by Final Order dated August
13, 1991. As part of the order, Respondent was required to pay $1,000 and his license to practice dentistry was placed
on probation for two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge further found that Respondent filed a DEA application for registration, dated November
8, 1991, and indicated that he never had a state professional license or controlled substance registration revoked,
suspended, denied, restricted, or placed on probation. In fact, Respondent knew that his dental license had twice
been disciplined and placed on suspension and probation by the Board. Since DEA must rely on the truthfulness of information
supplied by applicants in registering them to handle controlled substances, falsification cannot be tolerated.
Any material falsification of any application for registration is an independent statutory basis for the denial
of an application. Herbert J. Robinson, M.D., 59 FR 6304 (1994); John W. Wang, M.D., 57 FR 47869 (1992); Ronald H. Futch,
M.D., 53 FR 38990 (1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge recommended that the Administrator deny Respondent's application for registration
at this time. The administrative law judge further found that the circumstances are sufficient to support a recommendation
to the Administrator that an application be looked on favorably after the passage of one year. The Deputy Administrator
adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge in its entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Deputy Administrator may deny an application for DEA registration if he determines
that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following
factors be considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors are to be considered in the disjunctive. That is, the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one
or a combination of those factors, giving each the weight he deems appropriate in determining whether a registration
should be revoked, or an application denied. See David W. Warren, M.D., 55 FR 40017 (1990); Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,
54 FR 16422 (1989); England Pharmacy, 52 FR 1674 (1987); and Felix Seisin, M.D., 51 FR 3863 (1986).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that the fourth and fifth factors are relevant to the adjudication of this matter.
The record clearly establishes that the Respondent issued approximately 575 prescriptions for controlled substances
without a valid DEA registration. Further, Respondent had been excluded from the Medicare program and had disciplinary
action taken against him by the Florida Dental Board based upon Medicaid fraud and unprofessional conduct. Additionally,
Respondent falsified his DEA application. The administrative law judge concluded that the record warrants denial
of Respondent's application for registration at this time. The Deputy Administrator concurs in this evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR &sect;&sect;0.100(b) and 0.104 [59 FR 23637 (1994)], hereby orders that the
application for a DEA Certificate of Registration submitted by Linwood Thomas Townsend, D.D.S., dated November
8, 1991, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective July 22, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from May 27, 1994, through
June 10, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 8, 1994 (59 FR 29623).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(Project Director)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

It is proposed that the High Containment Pressure (Hi Level) actuation setting of [less than or equal to] 2.0 psig be
revised to [less than or equal to] 5.0 psig. This additional operating flexibility will decrease the frequency of
Containment venting necessary to relieve containment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-condensible gases which build up during normal operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon a statistical analysis of the containment pressure channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle,
a margin must be allowed between the Technical Specification limit (plant setting) and the Safety Analysis limit
so that the Safety Analysis limit(s) will not be exceeded under the worst circumstances. For a Technical Specification
value of [less than or equal to] 5.0 psig, the corresponding Safety Analysis limit must be increased to 10 psig to provide
margin for the channel statistical allowance. A safety evaluation performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 is on file which
supports a change in the Safety Analysis limit from 7.3 psig (current value) to 10.0 psig. Key conclusions of the Safety
Evaluation are that neither the probability nor the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important
to safety previously evaluated in the Safety Analysis report would be increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, assurance is provided that appropriate protective actions in accordance with the Technical Specifications
will be taken so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in the Technical Specification limit together with the change in the Safety Analysis limit provides
adequate margin to accommodate instrument channel uncertainty over a 30 month operating cycle. Plant equipment,
which would be set at the Technical Specification limit, will therefore provide protective functions to assure that
safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This would prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from that previously evaluated from occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the Technical Specification limit would decrease the frequency of containment purges necessary
to vent the build up of non-condensible gases during normal operation. This would result in a decrease in the amount
of radioactivity discharged to the environment (due to decay), decrease the potential for high Containment pressure
alarms and increase the margin for an ESF trip. The change to the Safety Analysis limits, justified by a safety Evaluation
performed in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, assures sufficient margin exists to accommodate channel instrument uncertainty
over the maximum operating cycle length. This margin is necessary so that safety functions will occur and Safety Analysis
limits will be preserved.

The proposed amendments would transfer the boron concentration in Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.1 for the reactor
coolant system and the refueling canal during MODE 6, and the boron concentration in TS 3.9.12 for the spent fuel pool
from the TS to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The application is submitted in response to the guidance in

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following analysis, performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91, shows that the proposed amendment will not create a significant
hazards consideration as defined by the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The relocation of boron concentration values to the COLR is an adminsitrative
change which will have no effect on the probability or consequences of any previously-analyzed accident. The required
values of boron concentration will continue to be determined through use of approved methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The administrative change of relocating parameters to the COLR, in this case boron concentration, cannot
create the probability of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required boron concentrations will remain appropriate for each cycle, and will continue to be calculated using approved
methodologies. There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Sections 3.1 and 4.1 for Protective Instrumentation,
the associated bases, and tables to increase the surveillance test intervals (STIs) and add allowable out-of-service
times (AOTs). All proposed STI and AOT changes are in accordance with General Electric Company Licensing Topical
Reports (LTRs) which have been previously reviewed and approved by the NRC staff. Also, AOTs are clarified in accordance
with the most recently approved BWR Owners' Group letters which were used in the development of NUREG-1433 ``Standard
Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' The Technical Specification changes will permit
specified Channel Tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly. The amendment will enhance operational
safety by reducing 1) the potential for inadvertent plant scrams, 2) excessive test cycles on equipment, and 3) the
diversion of plant personnel and resources on unnecessary testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional technical changes are proposed. The first change involves extending the Channel Calibration interval
for average power range monitor (APRM) scram instrumentation from weekly to quarterly. GPUN has evaluated the effect
of drift on the setpoint over the longer interval for this instrumentation and found it to be acceptable. The second
change would add a quarterly Channel Calibration requirement for High Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) and Turbine
Trip Scram instrumentation. This would be a new requirement not currently incorporated in the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nineteen editorial changes have been incorporated in Instrumentation Sections 3.1 and 4.1 to provide clarity and
consistency. These items are editorial only and do not alter the meaning or intent of any requirements. Examples of
editorial changes are: 1) capitalize definitions where used, 2) punctuation and grammatical corrections, 3) ensuring
consistency in STI nomenclature, and 4) reformat of tables. A table note and its associated footnote were deleted
which involved a 1985 licensing condition which is no longer applicable.

NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL CHANGES 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will
not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The generic analysis contained in LTR NEDC-30851P-A assessed the impact of changing RPS [reactor protection system]
STIs and adding AOTs on RPS failure frequency, scram frequency and equipment cycling. Specifically, Section 5.7.4,
``Significant Hazards Assessment,'' of NEDC-30851P-A states that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fewer challenges to the safeguards system, due to less frequent testing of the RPS, conservatively results in a decrease
of approximately one percent in core damage frequency. This decrease is based upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the plant-specific experience presented in Appendix J, the estimated reduction in scram frequency (0.3
scrams/yr) represents a 1 to 2 percent decrease in core damage frequency based on the BWR plant-specific Probabilistic
Risk Assessments (PRAs) listed in Table 5-8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in core damage frequency due to less frequent testing is less than one percent. This increase is even lower
(less than 0.01 percent) when the changes resulting from the implementation of the Anticipated Transients Without
Scram (ATWS) rule are considered. Therefore, this increase is more than offset by the decrease in CDF [core damage
frequency] due to fewer scrams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of reducing unnecessary cycles on RPS equipment, although not easily quantifiable also results in a decrease
in core damage frequency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall impact on core damage frequency of the changes in allowable out-of-service times is negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of a scram failure due to RPS unavailability
is insignificant. The overall probability of an accident is decreased as the time RPS logic operates as designed is
increased resulting in less inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The plant-specific evaluation performed
by GPUN and GE demonstrates that while the Oyster Creek RPS differs from the generic model analyzed in the RPS LTR (NEDC-30851P-A),
the net effect of the differences do not alter the generic conclusions. The AOTs proposed for RPS instrumentation
are based on improved wording developed for use in NUREG 1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric
Plants, BWR/4,'' which ensures a loss of function does not occur. In addition, the change to the APRM Scram Channel
Calibration surveillance interval from weekly to quarterly has been evaluated by GPUN to determine the effect on
setpoint drift. The results of the evaluation show acceptable performance of this scram parameter ensuring that
the safety analysis remains valid. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip
Scram instrumentation is appropriate since this trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches
which are fixed in position and adjusted, as necessary, during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch
adjustment methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve [MSIV] Scram for which the Technical Specifications
require only a Channel Test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LTR NEDC-30936P-A (Parts 1 and 2) contains an assessment of the impact of changing STIs and AOTs for BWR ECCS Actuation
Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Technical Assessment of Changes,'' of NEDC-30963P-A (Part 2) states that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results indicate an insignificant (less than 5E-7 per year) increase in water injection function failure frequency
when STIs are increased from 31 days to 92 days, AOTs for repair of the ECCS actuation instrumentation are increased
from one hour to 24 hours, and AOTs for surveillance testing are increased from two to six hours. For all four BWR models
the increase represents less than 4% increase in failure frequency. However, when other factors which influence
the overall plant safety are considered, the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of a water
injection failure due to ECCS instrumentation unavailability is insignificant and the net result is judged to be
an improvement in plant safety. The plant-specific evaluation performed by GPUN and GE demonstrates that while the
Oyster Creek ECCS differs from the generic model analyzed in LTR NEDC-30936P-A, the net effect of the plant-specific
differences do not alter the generic conclusions. The addition of a quarterly Channel Calibration STI for the High
Drywell Pressure ECCS initiation parameter is consistent with the calibration interval requirement for other similar
instrumentation at Oyster Creek and ensures the regular performance of calibrations. This is a new requirement not
currently contained in the Technical Specifications and experience performing the High Drywell Pressure (Core
Cooling) instrument calibration at a quarterly interval has proven adequate for instrument performance monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LTRs NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 and NEDC-31677P-A contain generic analyses assessing the impact of changing STIs
and AOTs for BWR Isolation Actuation Instrumentation which are common or not common to RPS and ECCS instrumentation.
Section 4.0, ``Summary of Results,'' of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 states that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results indicated that the effects on probability of failure to initiate isolation are very small and the effects
on probability or frequency of failure to isolate are negligible in nearly every case. In addition, the results indicated
that increasing the AOT to 24 hours for tests and repairs has a negligible effect on the probability of failure of the
isolation function. These combined with changes to the testing intervals and allowed out-of-service times for RPS
and ECCS instrumentation provide a net improvement to plant safety and operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Section 5.6, ``Assessment of Net Effect of Changes,'' of NEDC-31677P-A states that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reduction in core damage frequency (CDF) of at least as much as estimated in the ECCS instrumentation analysis can
be expected when the isolation actuation instrumentation STIs are changed from one month to three months. The chief
contributor to this reduction is the channel functional tests for the MSIVs. Inadvertent closure of the MSIVs will
cause an unnecessary plant scram. This reduction in CDF more than compensates for any small incremental increase
(10% or 1.0E-07/year) in calculated isolation function failure frequency when the STI is extended to three months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase
the consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of an isolation failure due
to isolation instrumentation unavailability is insignificant. The proposed wording of the AOTs is based on the clarifications
used in the development of NUREG 1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4,''
which ensures a loss of function does not occur where applied to isolation actuation instrumentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LTR NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 contains a generic analysis assessing the impact of changing control rod block STIs
on Rod Block failure frequency. Section 5 (Brookhaven National Laboratory Technical Evaluation Report - Attachment
2 to the NRC SER) of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 states that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BWROG proposed changes to the Technical Specifications concerning the test requirements for BWR control rod
block instrumentation. The changes consist of increasing the surveillance test intervals form one to three months.
These test interval extensions are consistent with the already approved changes to STIs for the reactor protection
system. The technical analysis reviewed and verified as documented herein indicates that there will be no significant
changes in the availability of the control rod block function if these changes are implemented. In addition, there
will be a negligible impact on the plant core melt frequency due to the decreased testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bases contained in GE Topical Report GENE-770-1-A assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on failure frequency
for selected systems. Section 2.0, ``Summary,'' of GENE-770-06-1-A states that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical bases are provided for selected proposed changes to the instrumentation STIs and AOTs that were identified
in the BWROG Improved BWR Technical Specification activity. These STI and AOT changes are consistent with approved
changes to the RPS, ECCS, and isolation actuation instrumentation. These proposed changes do not result in a degradation
to overall plant safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BWR Owners' Group concluded from the generic analysis in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 and the bases in GENE-770-06-1-A
that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. GPUN's utilization of GENE-770-06-1-A is limited to the identified AOTs for Control Rod Block instrumentation
analyzed in NEDC-30851P-A since the Control Rod Block LTR did not explicitly address AOTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of allowable out-of-service times (AOTs) consistent with wording developed for use in Improved Standard
Technical Specifications to ensure no loss of function and the revision of surveillance test intervals (STIs) does
not alter the function of RPS, ECCS, Isolation or Rod Block instrumentation nor involve any type of plant modification.
No new modes of plant operation are involved with the changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adding a quarterly Channel Calibration STI for High Drywell Pressure instrumentation (for Core Cooling) establishes
a requirement in the Technical Specifications which is not currently incorporated. This is an additional requirement
beyond that already in place for this instrumentation and will not alter its operation since by their nature STIs ensure
proper instrument performance. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram
instrumentation is appropriate since this trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches
which are fixed in position and adjusted during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment
methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only
a Channel Test. Revising the Channel Calibration STI for APRM Scram instruments from weekly to quarterly allows these
instruments to benefit from the Channel Test STI change provided by the generic analysis in the RPS LTR. The benefits
include a significant reduction in the number of half-scram states the plant will undergo reducing the potential
for inadvertent plant trips. The effect of setpoint drift over the longer interval has been evaluated and found acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes will not alter the physical characteristics of any plant systems or components and all safety-related
systems and components remain within their applicable design limits. Thus, system and component performance is
not adversely affected by these changes, thereby assuring that the design capabilities of those systems and components
are not challenged in a manner not previously assessed so as to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic studies contained in the GE Licensing Topical Reports and has concurred
with the BWR Owners' Group that the proposed changes do not significantly affect the availability of RPS, ECCS Actuation,
Isolation Actuation and Control Rod Block instrumentation. The proposed addition of allowable out-of-service
times for instruments addressed by the LTRs provides reasonable times for making repairs and performing tests. The
lack of sufficient out-of-service time provided in current Technical Specifications, increases the potential
for an inadvertent scram or equipment actuation. The proposed AOTs provide realistic times to complete required
actions without increasing overall instrument failure frequency and ensure that no loss of function occurs, therefore,
there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LTRs demonstrate that extending surveillance test intervals does not result in significant changes in the probability
of instrument failure. Where Channel Calibration frequency has not changed, assurance exists that setpoints will
not be affected by drift. In the case of the APRM Scram Channel Calibration, the proposed change to quarterly from weekly
has been evaluated and found acceptable. Expected instrument performance over the extended interval will assure
that applicable safety analyses will continue to be met. In addition, other instrumentation was evaluated for drift
effects of setpoints and was found acceptable. The addition of a quarterly Channel Calibration interval for High
Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) is consistent with Channel Calibration STIs for most other instrumentation
at Oyster Creek and has been the interval used to achieve an adequate level of instrument performance monitoring.
The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram instrumentation ensures consistency
in the establishment of surveillance requirements. This trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit
switches which are fixed in position and adjusted during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment
methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only
a Channel Test. These proposed changes, when coupled with the reduced probability of test-induced plant transients
and equipment failures, do not result in a reduction in the margin of safety.

No Significant Hazards Consideration Evaluation For Editorial Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above nineteen proposed changes are editorial in nature and are typical example I.c.2.e.i in 51FR7744. Therefore,
they do not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The editorial changes described above do not change the design or operation of any structure, system or component
relied upon to prevent or mitigate the consequences of any accident evaluated. These editorial changes also do not
add new structures, systems or components which may have an effect on existing elements of the facility. The changes
proposed correct, clarify and/or retain existing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since neither physical changes to the facility nor changes in its operation are involved in the proposed editorial
changes to the Technical Specifications, there is no possibility for creation of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facility configuration and operation are unaffected by the proposed editorial changes. As a result no changes in
margin of safety occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The editorial changes described and evaluated above are purely administrative to achieve consistency or correct
an error in the Technical Specifications.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revision proposed by Technical Specification Change Request (TSCR) No. 230 to the Technical Specifications
would revise specification 3.7.2.c, ``Unit Electric Power System,'' to eliminate testing of an emergency diesel
generator (EDG) when the redundant EDG is inoperable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment serves to assure that an EDG is always available to perform on demand and the lower number
of demands for performance reduce the probability of equipment failure. The required action no longer requires a
``test'' be performed. Therefore, the word ``test'' has been deleted from TS 3.7.2.c. The change is administrative.
Since the proposed amendment does not affect the design or performance of the diesel generators or their ability to
perform their design function, the change will not result in an increase in the consequences or probability of an accident
previously analyzed. The proposed change will increase diesel generator reliability, thereby increasing overall
plant safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Accidents involving loss of off-site power and single failure
have been previously evaluated. The change does not introduce any new mode of plant operation or new accident precursors,
involve any physical alterations to plant configurations, or make any changes to system setpoints which could initiate
a new or different kind of accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety. This change does not result in a reduction in the margin of safety since there is no margin of safety
associated with the supplemental immediate and daily testing of the operable EDG. If a margin of safety were presumed
to exist, no reduction would result because of the proposed amendment: no physical modification to the plant or change
to procedurally prescribed operator actions resulted from the proposed amendment.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would 1) allow entry through an operable personnel air lock hatch to perform surveillance
testing, repair an inoperable hatch, or perform other necessary activities inside containment, 2) update plant
Technical Specifications to reflect a previous change to the list of containment boundary valves, 3) add a new exception
to allow quarterly surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, 4) add a new exception to allow periodic preventive
maintenance on control room ventilation lasting up to 30 minutes per calendar quarter without a written report of
such inoperability, and 5) make related administrative changes to reflect and clarify items 1 through 4 above.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's analysis
is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containment air lock hatch entry, surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, and preventive maintenance
of control room ventilation are of short duration and do not alter any associated remedial action completion times,
or the requirements of Technical Specification 3.0.A. If necessary, prompt operator action to restore containment
integrity, excess flow check valve position, or control room ventilation is assured by plant operators, or individual(s)
procedurally dedicated to perform such restoration. The subject containment boundary valves are manual containment
isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without
compensatory measures to isolate the penetration. The boundary valves to be added remain closed during power operation,
and are opened only after the reactor is shut down and cooldown has begun. The boundary valves to be deleted are open
only during plant heatup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to containment air lock hatch entry, surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, and
preventive maintenance of the control room ventilation system, will not affect equipment reliability when such
equipment is required to be operable. The Limiting Conditions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation and Remedial Actions for these items remain unchanged to govern operability of the equipment. The containment
boundary valves being added are closed when the reactor is at power, and are opened only after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor is shut down. The boundary valves being deleted are open only during plant heatup. The subject boundary valves
are manual containment isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative
control without compensatory measures to isolate the penetration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change will not create any new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change would allow excess flow check valves to be exercised through approximately 1.5 inches of valve
travel on a quarterly basis without declaring the valves inoperable or taking compensatory measures. Such testing
constitutes approximately 15 minutes per calendar quarter, during which time containment isolation can easily
be reestablished. Similarly, access through an operable air lock hatch would allow the hatch to be open for only a short
period of time and while under control of an individual dedicated to operating the hatch. The proposed change also
permits the control room ventilation system to be inoperable for 30 minutes per calendar quarter, without a written
report of such inoperability. Because of the short time during which these systems are unavailable, and because operation
is easily reestablished, there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. The containment boundary valves
being added are closed when the reactor is at power, and are opened only after the reactor is shut down. The boundary
valves being deleted are open only during plant heatup. The subject boundary valves are manual containment isolation
valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without compensatory
measures to isolate the penetration.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concluded that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes
would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accident analyses for Millstone Unit No. 1 do not require a specific number of operators. Increasing the Technical
Specification minimum to require a third RO does not decrease the effectiveness of the shift staff in response to normal
or abnormal conditions. In fact, the third RO enhances the ability of the operating crew to mitigate complex transients
which could occur during beyond design basis events. The shifts have trained and functioned at the higher staffing
level for several years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The typographical corrections to page 6-4 provide a clearer representation of the required actions, and do not affect
the intent nor implementation of the specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of a third RO to the minimum shift-crew composition required by Technical Specification Table 6.2-1
does not affect the operation of the unit, nor does it change any of the operating procedures, off-normal procedures,
or EOPs [emergency operating procedures]. Staffing the control room with an additional operator enhances the capability
of the operating crew to mitigate transients. Therefore, addition of a third RO to the minimum shift-crew composition
cannot create the possibility of a new or different accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed addition of a third reactor operator is to ensure that sufficient operating staff is available to respond
to complex transients involving multiple equipment failures. Ensuring that sufficient resources are available
to cope with beyond design basis event scenarios provides an increase in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, revised battery and battery charger sizing calculations demonstrated that a charger capacity of 400 amperes
is sufficient to provide the continuous DC loads, and is capable of recharging a fully discharged station battery
in a timely manner consistent with the design basis discussed in Section 8.5.3.1 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 FSAR [Final
Safety Analysis Report]. The calculations determined that the largest continuous load was 154 amperes; therefore,
400 amperes of charging capacity could provide 246 amperes to recharge a battery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculations conservatively demonstrated that this charging capacity could recharge a battery in 10.37 hours.
This recharging time is well within the 12-hour recharging time discussed in Section 8.5.3.1 of the Millstone Unit
No. 2 FSAR. Additionally, this recharging time is more conservative than the 24-hour recharging time stated in Section
8.3.2 of the original Safety Evaluation for Millstone Unit No. 2. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed LCO and surveillance changes do not alter the existing DC bus configuration, as described in Section
8.5.3.1 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 FSAR. This bus configuration has been previously analyzed, and was found acceptable.
The proposed changes also meet the recharging time specified in the design basis. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

Currently, the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications contain response time requirements for the feedwater
isolation valves to ensure rapid isolation of feedwater to the steam generators and to maintain the peak containment
pressure below the containment design pressure of 54 psig. However, clear Action Statements specifying operability
requirements for the non-QA equipment associated with feedwater isolation are not included within the Millstone
Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications. NNECO's proposal to add sections 3/4.7.1.6, 3/4.8.2.1A, and 3/4.8.2.5 into
the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications will incorporate additional requirements regarding components
that are credited to provide feedwater isolation in the event of an MSLB inside containment. These proposed changes
will impose additional limitations, restrictions, and controls not currently in place in the Millstone Unit No.

Additionally, NNECO's proposals to modify the Bases and the Index of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications

and controls not currently in place in the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, NNECO's proposals to modify the Bases and the Index of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will: 1) provide personnel with information concerning the additional requirements, and 2) correct an editorial
error. These proposed changes to the Bases an the Index do not alter the manner in which equipment is operated, nor do
they affect equipment availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed license amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to add sections 3/4.7.1.6, 3/4.8.2.1A, and 3/4.8.2.5 into the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will incorporate additional requirements regarding components that are credited to provide feedwater isolation
in the event of an MSLB inside containment. These proposed changes will impose additional limitations, restrictions,
and controls not currently in place in the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, NNECO's proposals to modify the Bases and the Index of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will: 1) provide personnel with information concerning the additional requirements, and 2) correct an editorial
error. These proposed changes to the Bases and the Index do not alter the manner in which equipment is operated, nor
do they affect equipment availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In fact.
The margin of safety will be increased due to the imposition of restriction on the non-QA equipment credited for feedwater
isolation in the event of an MSLB inside containment.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the technical specifications to require a staggered monthly surveillance operational test of the reactor
trip bypass breakers (such that each breaker is tested every 62 days) will only make operational testing of the reactor
trip bypass breakers consistent with operational testing of the trip breakers and the automatic trip and interlock
logic. It will also reduce cycling of the reactor trip bypass breakers by eliminating the requirement to test both
bypass breakers during the monthly surveillance, thereby reducing maintenance and surveillance time. The proposed
changes do not affect any of the design basis accidents nor are there any malfunctions associated with these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this technical specification bases change only clarifies both the meaning of a reactor trip breaker
and trip breaker train which have been included for completeness and clarity concerning the reactor trip breaker
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the technical specifications to require a staggered monthly surveillance operational test of the reactor
trip bypass breakers (such that each breaker is tested every 62 days) will only make operational testing of the reactor
trip bypass breakers consistent with operational testing of the reactor trip breakers and the automatic trip and
interlock logic. There are no new failure modes associated with the proposed changes. Since the plant will continue
to operate as designed, the proposed changes will not modify the plant response to the point where it can be considered
a new accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the technical specifications to require a staggered monthly surveillance operational test of the reactor
trip bypass breakers (such that each breaker is tested ever 62 days) will only make operational testing of the reactor
trip bypass breakers consistent with operational testing of the reactor trip breakers and the automatic trip and
interlock logic. It will also reduce cycling of the reactor trip bypass breakers by eliminating the requirement to
test both bypass breakers during the monthly surveillance, thereby reducing maintenance and surveillance time.
The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact on the protective boundaries nor do they affect the consequences
of any accident previously analyzed. The surveillance requirements will still ensure that the reactor trip breakers
and the reactor trip bypass breakers are tested and within the limits. Therefore, the proposed changes will not impact
the margin of safety as designated in the bases of any technical specification.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would change operability requirements for the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System to require it to
be operable whenever irradiated fuel is in the spent fuel pool, which has had less than 60 days of decay time. Surveillance
requirements for the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System would be changed to require that the system be tested and
verified operable at no greater than 31 days prior to its required usage.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification will revise the period of time during which the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System must
be operable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The propose[d] change will require that the system is operable whenever irradiated fuel, which has decayed less than
60 days, is in the spent fuel pool. Currently, the system is required to be operable whenever a load is moved over the
pool or fuel is being moved in the pool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modification has no effect on the probability of a fuel handling accident. The consequences of a fuel handling
accident has been evaluated at two intervals. The first time is the minimum decay time. At this time (t=100 hours) with
irradiated fuel in the pool, the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System is required, per the existing and the proposed
Technical Specification, to be operable. Therefore, the consequences of an accident are identical to that described
in the FSAR [Final Safety Analyses Report]. The second scenario evaluated is when the filters are initially isolated
(t=60 days). The resultant offsite dose, assuming no filtration and lower core inventory due to decay, are significantly
lower than was calculated at t=100 hours. Therefore, the existing accident analysis in FSAR Section 15.7.4 is limiting
and the proposed modification will not impact the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not impact any system or component which could cause a fuel handling accident. The Fuel Building
Exhaust Filter System is used for accident mitigations. It's failure cannot, in any way, create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System has been analyzed at the two most critical times. The
first analysis was done when the fuel is first placed in the pool, and the second analysis was done when the filtration
system is isolated. The first event resulted in no change in assumptions in the analysis presented in the FSAR, ergo
no change in dose. The second event has been analyzed and doses have decreased, when compared to the first event. The
system will be verified operable per the performance of Surveillance Requirement 4.9.12a prior to fuel or load movement
over the pool. Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.

1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change would revise the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) surveillance criteria to allow the hot restart
test to be performed independent of the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) load sequencing test and the 24 hour endurance
run. The proposed surveillance requirements would continue to demonstrate that the objectives of each of these tests
are met. Specifically, the EDG's are shown to be capable of starting the ESF loads in the required sequence, operating
at full load for an extended period of time, and restarting from a full load temperature condition. Therefore, the
proposed changes would not adversely affect the EDG's ability to support mitigation of the consequences of any previously
evaluated accident. The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements do not affect the initiation or progression
of any accident sequence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change does not require physical changes to the plant or equipment, and does not impact any design
or functional requirements of the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The proposed change affects surveillance
test criteria such that increased scheduling flexibility is allowed while the test objectives associated with demonstrating
EDG operability continue to be met. The proposed changes do not allow any plant configurations that are presently
prohibited by the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change does not involve a change to the physical design or functional requirements of the Emergency
Diesel Generators (EDGs). Surveillance testing in accordance with the proposed Technical Specification will continue
to demonstrate the ability of the EDG's to perform their intended function of providing electrical power to ESF systems
needed to mitigate design basis transients, consistent with the plant safety analyses. The margin of safety demonstrated
by the plant safety analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accidents which are potentially negatively impacted by the proposed change are any Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)
inside primary containment as described in the PBAPS [Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station], Units 2 and 3 UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change increases the surveillance interval of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J Type A test (i.e., Containment
Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)) from 42 months to 66 months. This test is performed to determine that the total
leakage from containment does not exceed the maximum allowable primary containment leakage rate (i.e., designated
La) at a calculated peak containment internal pressure (Pa), as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J. The primary
containment limits the leakage of radioactive material during and following design bases accidents in order to comply
with the offsite dose limits specified in 10 CFR [Part] 100. Accordingly, the primary containment is not an accident
initiator, it is an accident mitigator. No physical or operational changes to the containment structure, plant systems,
or components would be made as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident
previously evaluated is not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure effects that are potentially created by the proposed one-time TS change have been considered. The relevant
components important to safety which are potentially affected are the containment structure, plant systems, and
containment penetrations. There are no physical or operational changes to any plant equipment associated with the
proposed TS change. Therefore, the probability or consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety
is not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change introduces the possibility that primary containment leakage in excess of the allowable value
(i.e., La) would remain undetected during the proposed 24 month extension of the interval between the second and third
Type A test. The types of mechanisms which could cause degradation of the primary containment can be categorized into
two types. These are: 1) degradation due to work which is performed as part of a modification or maintenance activity
on a component or system (i.e., activity-based), or; 2) degradation resulting from a time-based failure mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of activity-based failure mechanisms has determined that the potential from degradation due to activity
based mechanisms is minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the potential for primary containment degradation due to a time-based mechanism, we have concluded that
the PBAPS Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) program would identify most types of penetration leakage. The LLRT program involves
measurement of leakage from Type B and Type C primary containment penetrations as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix
J.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type B tests are intended to detect local leaks and to measure leakage across pressure
containing or leakage-limiting boundaries other than valves, such as containment penetrations incorporating
resilient seals, gaskets, expansion bellows, flexible seal assemblies, door operating mechanism penetrations
that are part of the containment system, doors, and hatches. 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type C testing is intended
to measure reactor system primary containment isolation valve leakage rates. The frequency of the Type B and Type
C testing is not being altered by the proposed TS change. [However, in an April 18, 1994 letter, the licensee has requested
a 60-day extension of the Type B and Type C testing.] The acceptance criterion for Type B and Type C leakage is 0.6 La (i.e.,
0.3 % wt/day) which, when compared to the Type A test acceptance criterion of 0.75 La (i.e., 0.375 % wt/day), is a significant
portion of the Type A test allowable leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change only extends the interval between two consecutive Type A tests. The Type B and Type C tests will
be performed as required. The Type B and Type C tests will continue to be used to confirm that the containment isolation
valves and penetrations have not degraded. Containment system components that would not be tested are the containment
structure itself and small diameter instrumentation lines. Time-based degradation of any of the instrumentation
lines would most likely be identified by faulty instrument indication or during instrument calibrations that will
be performed during the PBAPS, Unit 2 refueling outage 10. In examining the potential for a time-based failure mechanism
that could cause significant degradation of the containment structure, we concluded that the risk, if any, of such
a mechanism is small since the design requirements and fabrication specifications established for the containment
structure are in themselves adequate to ensure containment leak tight integrity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above evaluation, we have concluded that the proposed TS change will have a negligible impact on the consequences
of any accident previously evaluated. To support this conclusion, a review of the PBAPS, Unit 2 CILRT history was performed.
This review identified that the only failure mechanism that has been detected during the past CILRTs is an activity
based component failure, and that there is no indication of any time-based degradation that would not be identified
during performance of Type B and Type C tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this review concluded that the risk of undetected primary containment degradation is not increased, the
Individual Plant Examination (IPE) for PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, was also reviewed in order to assess the impact of exceeding
the primary containment allowable leakage rate, if a non-mechanistic activity type (i.e., time-based) failure
were to occur. The IPE included an evaluation of the effect of various containment leakage sizes under different scenarios.
The IPE results showed that a containment leakage rate of 35% wt/day would represent less than a 5% increase in risk
to the public being exposed to radiation. This evaluation was based on a study performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory
for light water reactors that evaluated the impact of leakage rates on public risk. As stated earlier, the current
value of La for PBAPS, Unit 2, is 0.5% wt/day, which is significantly less than the 35% wt/day discussed in the IPE evaluation.

Therefore, the proposed TS change involving a one-time extension of the Type A test interval and performing the third
Type A test after the second Appendix J 10-year service period will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is an increase of a surveillance test interval and does not make any physical or operational changes
to existing plant systems or components. Primary containment acts as an accident mitigator not initiator. Therefore,
the possibility of a different type of accident than any previously evaluated or the possibility of a different type
of equipment malfunction is not introduced.

3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total primary containment leakage rate ensures that the total containment leakage volume will not exceed the
value assumed in the safety analyses at the peak accident pressure. As an added conservatism, the measured overall
leakage rate is further limited to less than or equal to 0.75 La during performance of periodic tests to account for
possible degradation of the containment leakage barriers between leakage tests. There is the potential that containment
degradation could remain undetected during the proposed 24 month surveillance interval extension and result in
the containment leakage exceeding the allowable value assumed in safety analysis. A review of activity-based failure
mechanisms has determined that the potential from degradation due to activity based mechanisms is minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the potential for primary containment degradation due to a time-based mechanism, we have concluded that
the PBAPS Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) program would identify most types of penetration leakage. The LLRT program involves
measurement of leakage from Type B and Type C primary containment penetrations as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix
J.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type B tests are intended to detect local leaks and to measure leakage across pressure
containing or leakage-limiting boundaries other than valves, such as containment penetrations incorporating
resilient seals, gaskets, expansion bellows, flexible seal assemblies, door operating mechanism penetrations
that are part of the containment system, doors, and hatches. 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type C testing is intended
to measure reactor system primary containment isolation valve leakage rates. The frequency of the Type B and Type
C testing is not being altered by the proposed TS change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a review of the results of previous PBAPS, Unit 2 CILRT results concluded that the only failure mechanism
which has been detected during the past CILRTs is activity-based and that there is no indication of time-based failures
that would not be identified during performance of Type B and Type C tests. Therefore, we have concluded that the proposed
extended test interval would not result in a non-detectable PBAPS, Unit 2 primary containment leakage rate in excess
of the allowable value (i.e., 0.5% wt/day) established by the TS and 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would reduce the allowed outage time for the residual heat removal (RHR) suction relief valves
(SRVs) in accordance with the guidance of Generic Letter (GL) 90-06. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change decreases the allowed outage time of a Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) system. There
is no hardware, software, or operating methodology change, so there is no increase in probability or consequences.
Since the time allowed for one train of this equipment to be inoperable is shorter, the probability of an overpressure
event not being mitigated has also been reduced. The consequences will not change unless the system or operation of
the system changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. [The proposed change will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As this proposed change will not involve any changes to hardware, software, or operating practices, it cannot create
any possibility of new or different kinds of accidents from those previously analyzed. The RHR SRVs are intended to
provide protection against a rupture of a pressure boundary from an over-pressure condition which has the potential
to result in core uncovery. The original design basis of the plant complies with the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix
G and uses the RHR SRVs to meet the fracture toughness requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix G. This change only increases
the availability of this protection and does not create any new or different kinds of accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. [The proposed amendment does not] [i]nvolve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCE&amp;G already has administrative controls in place to minimize the possibility of an overpressure event occurring
as well as to assure that there are two trains of LTOP equipment operable during the modes when the potential exists
for this event. There are controls to preclude the inadvertent start-up of a Reactor Coolant Pump or Charging Pump
and controls to ensure that both RHR Suction Isolation Valves for each train are open and remain open except for testing
and maintenance. This alignment is maintained until the RHR System is realigned for its ECCS function. These controls
are proceduralized in plant operating procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as nothing is changed which affects the margin
in a negative direction. The decrease in AOT actually increases the margin since the allowed time for one train to be
inoperable has been reduced.

be added to Specification 4.3.1.1.3 indicating that neutron detectors are exempt from response time testing. These

TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the response time limit requirements for the reactor trip or engineered safety
feature actuation systems or surveillance testing and frequency. Placing these limits in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (UFSAR) will ensure the plant design basis is maintained in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59. Since no
actual changes to response time limits or surveillance requirements are involved, the probability or consequences
of an accident are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes does not affect any plant equipment, functions, or setpoint by relocating response time limits
to the UFSAR. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will continue to require SQN to maintain the plant functions at the required setpoints necessary
for the design basis and to support the accident analysis. The margin of safety is not reduced because there is no change
to plant functions and the 10 CFR 50.59 process will continue to ensure the plant design basis is appropriately maintained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control room emergency ventilation system (CREVS) was designed to ensure control room habitability during accident
conditions. The design basis of SQN does not include an accident creating a contaminated air condition concurrent
with a tornado. The ability of the CREVS to perform its design function has not been affected by this change. The proposed

Both accidents are assumed to occur independently. This change does not create a new or different accident not previously

The proposed change would clarify and consolidate the technical specifications (TS) regarding the dual function

one or more vacuum relief (VR) lines be incapable of performing its containment isolation function or incapable of
performing its VR function. In addition, the testing requirements would be revised to add specific requirements
and reflect the inservice test (IST) program by relocating the testing requirements from TS 4.6.3.2.d and Table 3.6-2
to the new TS 4.6.6 (and to Sequoyah's IST program). Other proposed changes affect Bases 3/4.6.6 section and TS index

which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TVA's proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change does not increase the probability of an accident since the proposed change does not
affect any plant systems, equipment, or components. The dual design functions of SQN's containment vacuum relief
(VR) system (i.e., provide containment VR and containment isolation) are not affected. The consequences of an event
are not significantly increased by the proposed increase in allowed outage time from 4 hours to 72 hours for returning
an inoperable VR system to operable status. The probability of an event during the relatively short duration of the
TS completion times, in conjunction with the redundancy provided in the design of the system, provide sufficient
assurance that the VR lines are available for mitigating an accident or abnormal event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No physical modification is being made to any plant hardware or plant operating setpoints, limits, or operating procedures
as a result of this change. TVA's proposed change provides a TS improvement that clarifies the TS requirements associated
with the dual design function of SQN's VR system. The proposed change removes the potential for creating a conflict
between Specification 3/4.6.3, ``Containment Isolation Valves,'' and Specification 3/4.6.6, ``Vacuum Relief
Valves.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter any accident analysis or any assumptions used to support the accident analyses.
The containment leakage assumptions used to determine offsite dose limits for compliance with 10 CFR 100 are not affected.
The analysis that supports the containment VR system also remains unchanged. The proposed 72-hour and 1-hour completion
times for returning an inoperable VR line to operable status are consistent with the NUREG-1431 and NUREG-1433. Consequently,
the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety provided by the design of SQN's containment VR system remains unchanged. TVA's proposed change
does not affect the VR function or the containment isolation function that currently exists in SQN TSs. The proposed
change eliminates the potential for conflicting requirements within SQN TSs and ensures that the proper action is
taken to preserve these dual design functions while the plant is in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4. TVA's proposed change provides
a TS improvement that combines these functional requirements into a single specification. Both VR and containment
isolation requirements will continue to be provided. Accordingly, the proposed change does not involve a reduction
in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, technical specifications
(TS) by (1) changing the allowable value for Unit 2 overtemperature N-16 and pressurizer pressure-low setpoints,
(2) deleting Equation 2.2-1 from TS 2.2.1, and (3) administrative changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Overtemperature N-16, Unit 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incorporation of the increased temperature uncertainties reported by Rosemount will change the Allowable Value
of the Overtemperature N-16 trip function. The change does not affect the Safety Analysis Limits assumed in the accident
analysis. Because the change only impacts the Allowable Value for a setpoint and does not affect any system designs
or operations, the change does not increase the probability of an accident. Although the Allowable Value is changed
in the conservative direction, the change assures that, considering the newly identified transmitter uncertainty,
the trip actuates prior to the conditions assumed in the accident analyses. As such, there is no impact on the consequences
of any accidents previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressurizer Pressure - Low, Unit 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The added uncertainties change the Allowable Value of the Unit 2 Pressurizer Pressure-Low Reactor Trip function.
The change does not affect the Safety Analysis Limits assumed in the accident analysis. Because the change only impacts
the Allowable Value for a setpoint and does not affect the system design or operations, the change does not increase
the probability of an accident. Although the Allowable Value is changed in the conservative direction, the change
assures that, considering the newly identified transmitter uncertainty, the trip actuates prior to the conditions
assumed for the accident analyses. As such, there is no impact on the consequences of any accidents previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equation 2.2-1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to Specifications 2.2.1 and 3.3.2, to Tables 2.2-1 and 3.3-3, and to the bases sections will require recalibration
of the channel and removal of any accumulated errors in any function whose ``as found'' setpoint is found to be less
conservative than its allowable value. These changes delete a potentially less conservative option and will result
in actual channel operation closer to the nominal setpoint and within the allowable value band. These changes will
in effect validate one of the assumptions made in the accident analysis and will not increase the probability or consequences
of any accident evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to combine the Unit 1 and Unit 2 line items into a dual Unit line if the Trip Setpoint and Allowable Value values
are the same is administrative and meant as a human factors improvement for operator convenience. The change does
not affect the operation of any equipment, the operating point of any equipment, nor any equipment hardware and thus
does not increase the probability or consequences of any accident evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overtemperature N-16 and Pressurizer Pressure - Low, Unit 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the proposed amendment changes only the Unit 2 Allowable Values of the Overtemperature N-16 reactor trip and the
Pressurizer Pressure-Low reactor trip and does not have any physical effect on the transmitter or circuitry, there
are no new or different types of accident introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equation 2.2-1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of this equation and its associated action statements, definitions and values does not introduce any physical
changes to any systems, structures, or components. The change merely assures that setpoints which are less conservative
than their Allowable Value are recalibrated prior to being declared operable. These changes do not introduce any
new credible failure modes which may create the possibility of a new or different accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Combining line items for Unit 1 and Unit 2 into a dual Unit entry for administrative purposes does not introduce any
new credible failure modes which may create the possibility of a new or different accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overtemperature N-16 and Pressurizer Pressure - Low, Unit 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incorporation of the added temperature uncertainties of the Rosemount transmitters assures that the safety analysis
limits assumed in the accident analyses for Overtemperature N-16 and Pressurizer Pressure-Low reactor trip functions
for Unit 2 are met. There is no change in the acceptance criteria or the results of these analyses due to this change.
Thus there is no effect on the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equation 2.2-1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of Equation 2.2-1, related actions and associated definitions and values, merely eliminates one option
to assure that the safety analysis assumptions are met. This option is not presently in use and the accident analyses
assumptions have been and will continue to be met using the other option (to re-calibrate channels prior to restoring
operability). Thus the margin of safety is unaffected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Combining the Unit 1 and Unit 2 line items of Table 2.2-1 for RTS [Reactor Trip Systems] functions and of Table 3.3-3
for ESFAS [Engineered Safety Features Actuation System] functions into dual unit entries does not change the Trip
Setpoint or the Allowable Value for the functions. The margin of safety is unaffected.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 6.2.2.g to reflect a title designation change within the
Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC) organization. The title of Supervisor Operations is being changed
to Assistant Manager Operations. The title change does not represent any change in reporting relationships, job
responsibilities, or overall organizational commitments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. This change involves an administrative change to the WCNOC organization and to the position title and
as such has no effect on plant equipment or the technical qualification of plant personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
This change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to installed plant systems or the overall operating
philosophy of Wolf Creek Generating Station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change does not involve any
changes in overall organizational commitments. A position title change alone does not reduce any margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification Table 3.6-1, ``Containment Isolation Valves,'' by deleting
reference to two (2) valves. The Technical Specification change reflects a planned modification which removes the
essential service water (ESW) containment air cooler return line isolation valve bypass valves and associated piping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the design modification is completed the ESW Containment Penetrations will be provided with stainless steel
isolation valves, which will be provided with automatic SIS [safety injection signal] actuation signals to open
automatically to provide required cooling water flow to the Containment Air Coolers following a LOCA [loss-of-coolant
accident] or MSLB [main steamline break]. Replacement of the current carbon steel isolation valves with stainless
steel valves and removing the unnecessary bypass lines and bypass isolation valves will reduce the amount of seat
leakage currently experienced with these valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident is not increased because this modification does
not introduce any new potential accident initiating conditions. The consequences of an accident previously evaluated
is not increased because the ability of containment to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity
to the environment will not be degraded by this modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification will reduce the number of containment isolation valves and replace several carbon steel
isolation valves with stainless steel valves, which will be less susceptible to erosion and corrosion. Thus, potential
system leakage will be reduced by this modification, while valve reliability will be enhanced. The new valves are
designed to the original ESW System requirements, and removal of the bypass lines and bypass isolation valves will
not result in a malfunction of any other plant equipment. Therefore, this proposed modification will not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the bypass lines and bypass isolation valves will not adversely affect containment isolation capability
for credible accident scenarios. Due to a previous design change, the bypass lines are no longer required to ensure
adequate cooling flow to the Containment Air Coolers. In addition, the operability and reliability of the remaining
isolation valves will be enhanced by replacing the current carbon steel valves with stainless steel valves.

Brief description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would allow reduced power operation as a function of reactor coolant system (RCS) total flow rate for
flow rate reductions of up to 5 percent below the currently specified flow rate. Operation will be allowed at total
flow rates slightly lower than (293,540 gpm X (1.0 plus C1)) if rated thermal power (RTP) is reduced by 1.5 percent for
each one percent that RCS total flow is less than this rate. This change would provide for needed operational margin
and flexibility without the unnecessary penalty of a large power reduction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments modify Technical Specification (TS) Figure 3.2-1, ``REACTOR COOLANT COLD LEG vs CORE POWER LEVEL,''
of TS 3/4.2.6, ``REACTOR COOLANT COLD LEG TEMPERATURE,'' for Units 1 and 3 to include the cold leg temperature between
552
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and 562
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F at core power levels between 90 percent and 100 percent within the AREA OF ACCEPTABLE OPERATION. Also, the proposed
amendments modify TS 3/4.1.1.4, ``MINIMUM TEMPERATURE FOR CRITICALITY,'' and BASES 3/4.1.1.4, ``MINIMUM TEMPERATURE
FOR CRITICALITY,'' to allow the minimum temperature for criticality to be established at 545
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, rather than the current value of 552
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, to establish the surveillance temperature at 552
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, rather than the current 557

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments relating to the March 23, 1994, application revise Technical Specification (TS) 6.9.2, ``Core Operating
Limits Report,'' (COLR) to include a reference to a Duke Power Company Topical Report describing an analytical method
for determining the core operating limits. Specifically, the amendments add: ``(4) DPC-NE-1004A, Nuclear Design
Methodology Using CASMO-3/SIMULATE-3P,'' to TS 6.9.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The May 11, 1994, letter added a statement to TS 6.9.2 that the approved methods used to determine the core operating
limits given in TS 6.9.1 are specified in the COLR. The May 11 and 17, 1994, letters provided information regarding
Duke Power's transition from the EPRI-NODE-P based methodology to the simulate methodology. Revision 1 to the COLR
for Oconee 1 Cycle 16 was submitted by letter dated May 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By July
22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

(Project Director)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. These changes revise the existing steam generator tube repair criteria to allow usage of the voltage-based
criteria identified by the staff in draft NUREG-1477 as the interim plugging criteria (IPC). Additionally, a footnote
is added to TS 3.4.8 to limit the dose equivalent iodine-131 concentration to 0.35 microcuries per gram of coolant
for the limited time period cited above. The Unit 1 Bases are revised to be consistent with the changes cited above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that by letter dated May 23, 1994, Anthony J. Ross (Petitioner) has requested that the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (Commission): (1) Issue a Severity Level II violation against a maintenance manager at the
Millstone plant, (2) institute other sanctions against the manager, and (3) remove the maintenance manager from
his position until resolution of the issues raised in his request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner, who is employed as an electrician at the plant, asks for this action on the grounds that he was told by the
maintenance manager that he must report all safety concerns to the manager before reporting them elsewhere. Petitioner
asserts that this action reflects an environment of harassment, retaliation and intimidation that exists at the
Millstone plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by section 2.206, appropriate time will be taken on this request
within a reasonable time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;62, issued to the Illinois Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Clinton Power
Station, Unit 1, located in DeWitt County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.1, ``Reactor Coolant System Leakage_Leakage
Detection Systems,'' to permit continued plant operation with inoperable drywell floor drain sump flow rate monitoring
instrumentation. Continued plant operation would be permitted until the first time the plant is required to be brought
to COLD SHUTDOWN after July 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.1 requires that systems capable of monitoring unidentified reactor coolant system
leakage rates remain operable. Rector coolant system leakage that falls on the drywell floors is channeled through
the floor drains and enters the drywell floor drain sump. Prior to entering the floor drain sump, water passes through
the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring instrumentation where the instantaneous flow rates and total integrated
flow are measured. The flow monitoring instrumentation consists of a V-notch weir box containing a capacitance probe.
Water flows through a V-notch water level which is directly proportional to the flow through the weir box. Thus, flow
through the V-notch is equal to the sump inlet flow rate. The capacitance probe is calibrated to correspond to the incoming
flow rate and provides a continuous control room indication of the unidentified reactor coolant system leakage rate.
An alarm is generated when the technical specification limit of 5 gpm of unidentified leakage occurs. The V-notch
weir box instrumentation meets the accuracy and sensitivity requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.45 for drywell floor
drain sump flow monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee began to observe questionable readings from the indicated drywell floor drain sump inlet flow and subsequently
declared the drywell floor drain sump monitoring instrumentation inoperable on June 10, 1994. Technical Specification
3.4.3.1 permits 30 days of continuous plant operation provided the drywell floor drain sump flow rate is monitored
and determined by alternative means at least once every 8 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All efforts by the licensee to restore the drywell sump inlet flow monitoring instrumentation to operable status
have been unsuccessful. The instrument loop has been recalibrated and equipment external to the drywell has been
verified to be operating properly. The only option remaining for the licensee is to enter the drywell in order to examine
the V-notch weir box and associated capacitance probe. However, the V-notch weir box is located in a keyway beneath
the reactor vessel and inside the biological shield wall. Due to the high radiation and temperatures in this location,
a plant shutdown would be required before personnel would be able to reach the instrumentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated June 20, 1994, the licensee requested that this amendment application be treated as an emergency
because unless approved, technical specifications would require a plant shutdown. The licensee stated that such
action would be necessary to preclude an unnecessary plant transient and related plant risk associated with a plant
shutdown. Due to time constraints, sufficient time is not available to permit the customary public notices in advance
of this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

(1) The proposed change does not affect any initiators of any previously evaluated accidents. Additionally, the
proposed change involves equipment that only provides indication and therefore, it cannot increase the probability
of any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Section 7.7.1.24.1, no credit is taken in the safety analysis for
operation of or operator reliance upon the leakage detection monitoring instrumentation associated with the drywell
sumps. Notwithstanding, the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring system provides the capability to detect and
measure leakage from unknown sources of leakage in the drywell. The drywell floor drain sump inlet flow monitoring
V-notch weir box instrumentation is designed to meet the accuracy requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.45. This instrumentation
does not provide any automatic action or control functions. In addition to the V-notch system, drywell floor drain
sump flow rates can be determined by using the sump pump pump-out timers, cycle counters and level switches. In addition,
unidentified leakage into the drywell is monitored by a flow rate meter in the condensate discharge line from the drywell
air coolers and by a particulate and a gaseous radiation monitoring channel of the drywell fission product monitor.
While the drywell fission product monitor does not provide a quantitative leakage rate, it is sensitive enough to
provide plant operators with early indication of an unanticipated increase in unidentified leakage. Furthermore,
a number of other parameters are monitored with appropriate instrumentation to provide the plant operators with
indirect indication of increases in unidentified leakage. These parameters include drywell pressure and drywell
temperature. These alternative methods of detecting increases in unidentified leakage rates provide operators
with sufficient information to take appropriate action to respond to an increase in leakage. Based on the above, Illinois
Power concludes that the proposed change will not increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed change does not involve any modification to plant structures or components and only involves equipment
that provides indication of leakage to the plant operators. The affected equipment does not provide any automatic
action or control functions. As a result, the proposed change does not involve a change in the operation of the plant,
nor does it introduce any new failure modes. Therefore, this proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The margin of safety associated with the instrumentation affected by the proposed change may be related to the
limits on unidentified leakage. As stated in the Bases for Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.2. ``The allowable leakage
rates from the reactor coolant system have been based on the predicted and experimentally observed behavior of cracks
in pipes .&blank;.&blank;. The evidence obtained from experiments suggests that for leakage somewhat greater than
that specified for unidentified leakage the probability is small that the imperfection or crack associated with
such leakage would grow rapidly. With respect to Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) related cracks
in service sensitive austenitic stainless steel piping however, an additional limit on the allowed increase in unidentified
leakage (within a 24-hour period or less) is imposed in accordance with NRC Generic Letter 88&hyph;01, `NRC Position
on IGSCC in BWR Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping,' since an abrupt increase in the unidentified leakage could be
indicative of leakage from such a source.'' The proposed change does not alter any of these limits on the unidentified
leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously described, flow rates into the drywell floor drain sump can be determined based on the indicated run
time for the sump pumps and the known pump flow rates or by monitoring the sump fill-up times and considering the volume
corresponding to the current level control band. These alternate methods are sufficient to determine whether unidentified
leakage in the drywell exceeds the 5 pgm limit and whether changes in this leakage exceed the limit of a 2 gpm increase
in any 24-hour period or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, with respect to the ability to detect changes in unidentified leakage rates, in addition to the V-notch
system, drywell floor drain sump flow rates can be determined by using the sump pump pump-out timers, cycle counters
and level switches. In addition, unidentified leakage into the drywell is monitored by a flow rate meter in the condensate
discharge line from the drywell air coolers and by a particulate and a gaseous radiation monitoring channel of the
drywell fission product monitor. While the drywell fission product monitor does not provide a quantitative leakage
rate, it is sensitive enough to provide plant operators with early indication of an unanticipated increase in the
unidentified leakage rate involving reactor coolant. Furthermore, a number of other parameters are monitored with
appropriate instrumentation to provide the plant operators with indirect indication of increases in unidentified
leakage. These parameters include drywell pressure and drywell temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring instrumentation does not provide any automatic action
or control functions. Further, as stated in USAR Section 7.7.1.24.1, no credit is taken in the safety analysis for
operation of or operator reliance upon the leakage detection monitoring instrumentation associated with the drywell
sumps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of all the above, Illinois Power concludes that the proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin
of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street,
Clinton, Illinois, 61727. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the
Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in providing
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide significant information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Southern Nuclear Operating Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;2 issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company (the licensee) for operation of the Joseph M.
Farley Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, located in Houston County, Alabama.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification 3/4.2.3 to change the nuclear enthalpy rise hot channel
factor (F delta H) from equal to or less than 1.65 [1 plus .3(1&hyph;P)] to equal to or less than 1.70 [1 plus .3(1&hyph;P)]
where P is a fraction of rated power. The amendment would also revise the action statement to reflect guidance contained
in the improved standard technical specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed increase in [F delta H] for Vantage 5 fuel does not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the Farley Final Safety Analysis Report. No changes in the mechanical
design of the fuel are necessary for this [F delta H] increase. No new performance requirements are being imposed on
the fuel or any system or component because of this change. Vantage 5 fuel contains several features that provide increased
margin to core limits. The proposed increase in [F delta H] is utilization of this margin with no violation of any acceptance
criteria. Subsequently, overall plant integrity is not reduced. [F delta H] is not an accident initiator. Therefore,
the probability of an accident has not significantly increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radiological consequences of all accidents, including the fuel handling accident, remain within the previous
appropriate acceptance limits as well as those included in 10CFR100. Therefore, the radiological consequences
to the public resulting from any accident previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report has not significantly
increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed specification change to the [F delta H] limit does not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report. No new accident scenarios, failure
mechanisms, or limiting single failures are introduced as a result of the increase in [F delta H]. Any accident using
the revised analytical assumption has been evaluated or reanalyzed and it has been determined that there is no adverse
effect on, or do not challenge the performance of, any safety-related system. Therefore, the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident, is not created.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Will the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Vantage 5 technical specification change for increasing [F delta H] does not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety. The margin of safety for the Vantage 5 fuel parameters are defined by the accident analyses
that are performed to conservatively bound the operating conditions defined by the technical specifications and
to demonstrate that the regulatory acceptance limits are met. Performance of analyses (including the LBLOCA [large
break loss-of-coolant accident]) and evaluations for the proposed inclusion of an increased [F delta H] for Vantage
5 fuel type confirmed that the operating envelope defined by the technical specifications continues to be bounded
by the revised analytical basis, which in no case exceeds the acceptance limits. Therefore, the margin of safety provided
by the analyses in accordance with these acceptance limits is maintained and is not significantly reduced.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Houston-Love Memorial Library, 212 W. Burdeshaw Street,
Post Office Box 1369, Dothan Alabama 36302. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by
the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman
of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714,
a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,
and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the
reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature
of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's
property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered
in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject
matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to
intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days
prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the
specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled
in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the
contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of
the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation
of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention
and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide
references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends
to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a
genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters
within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle
the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with
respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;21
which authorizes operation of the WNP&hyph;2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of
3323 megawatts thermal. The WNP&hyph;2 facility is a boiling water reactor located on Hanford Reservation in Benton
County near Richland, Washington. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations,
and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires, in part, that ``Type C tests shall be performed during each
reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than two years.'' By letter dated April 29, 1987,
the staff issued an exemption from the requirement for Type C testing during each reactor refueling shutdown, and
an extension of the maximum interval from 24 months to 27 months for Type B and C testing. This exemption specifically
excluded Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves, which the staff required to continue to be tested at the existing
6-month interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security;
and (2) where special circumstances at present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated March 25, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50 Appendix J to allow Type C testing
of Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves with metal-to-metal seats at 27-month intervals. The licensee plans
to replace approximately half of the valves during the 1994 refueling outage, and the remainder at a future date. No
change to the 6-month test interval is requested for the remaining Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves that
have resilient seats. In a letter dated December 20, 1993, regarding an associated technical specification change
request, the licensee stated that the new valves have been proven by industry experience and design to be capable of
maintaining design requirements for leakage over an extended period of time. The licensee indicated that the replacement
valves will be required to meet even tighter permissible leakage limits. Extending the maximum allowable interval
between tests to 27 months is requested to allow for variations in the weather-related length of the approximately
annual operating cycle from year to year. Details concerning the justification for extending the Type C test interval
from 24 to 27 months are contained in the staff's letter granting the exemption dated April 29, 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's proposed test schedule for the metal-to-metal seated
Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves is acceptable, and can be tested at a 27-month maximum interval. The remaining
valves with resilient seats will continue to be tested every 6 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when applicable of the regulation in the particular
circumstance is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. Application of the resilient-seated
valve leak test requirements to metallic-seated valves would increase surveillance and maintenance costs for no
increased safety benefit. The vendor certifies that appropriate leakage criteria are met, as applicable. The licensee
states that the valve design, specifications, and qualification documentation for these valves verify that Type
C leakage testing intervals are appropriate. The special circumstance of 10 CFR 50.12(as)(2)(ii) for extending
the Type C leakage test interval from 24 months to 27 months is as described in the staff's letter granting the exemption
dated April 29, 1987. Consequently, the Commission concludes that the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii)
exist in that application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption as described in Section
III. above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with
the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10
CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption from the requirement for Type C testing during each reactor
refueling shutdown, with an extension of the maximum interval from 24 months to 27 months for Type C testing, as described
in Section III. above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 27075).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee is seeking public comments on the possible effect on U.S. trade of China's accession to the GATT/WTO,
with particular reference to any trade measures applied by China that could be subject to the provisions of the GATT
or the WTO, particularly market access issues. Public comments on market access issues related to China's GATT accession
were requested in August 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments will be considered in developing the U.S. position and objectives for an eventual request of the Chinese
government related to market access (tariff rates and non-tariff measures) concerning the establishment of schedules
for market access in the areas of agriculture, industrial goods, and services. Information on products or practices
subject to these negotiations should include, whenever appropriate, the import or export tariff classification
number used by China for the product concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons submitting written comments should provide a statement, in twenty copies, by noon, Wednesday, July 13, 1994

In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants have informed DTC that pursuant to the terms of stock loan agreements, the borrower must promptly pass
to the lender distributions received on the borrowed securities during the period that the loan is outstanding. Stock
loan activity among participants is a high-volume business, and there usually are many outstanding loans in DTC's
system at any one time. Because the underlying collateral involved in these loans constantly changes, careful record
keeping of loan activity for the purpose of determining the proper allocation of income distributions is important.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While existing DTC procedures enable participants to identify stock loan-related deliver orders (``DOs'') through
the use of reason codes, proper allocation of income payments arising from these loans currently rests entirely with
the lending and borrowing participants because DTC currently allocates such income to participants to whom the securities
are credited on the relevant date (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 generally the record date). Lending participants recover income that DTC has allocated to borrowers of securities
either through DTC's securities payment order (``SPO'') service or through some other mechanism upon which the participants
mutually agree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed stock loan income-tracking system will facilitate participants' processing of income attributable
to securities that are the subject of outstanding stock loans.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed system will track and monitor participants' stock loan-related DOs; will net the share amounts by participant,
CUSIP, and transaction type; and will automatically credit income distributions to the proper participant on income
payment date. To accomplish this, DTC will create a special stock loan memo account, which will maintain a daily net
balance of loan obligations for each stock loan counterparty of each participant.

 because of a DO processed with an incorrect reason code), either the lending or borrowing participant can adjust the
stock loan memo account position through the participant terminal system (``PTS''). Any such adjustments will be
subject to affirmation by the counterparty participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule change will provide that a party from whom distributions are due to be transferred may
unilaterally halt all future distribution transfers by giving a letter of instructions to DTC two or more business
days in advance and by giving a copy to the counterparty. DTC will notify the counterparty participant of any action
DTC takes based on the instructions. DTC will implement the directions contained in the letter of instructions without
making any determination about the parties' legal obligations to each other. If the participant submitting the letter
of instructions is in fact still legally obligated, the noninstructing counterparty may seek to enforce its right
to receive future distributions outside of DTC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If by reason of merger, acquisition, or the like, one participant's accounts are being transferred to another participant,
DTC also will transfer the transferring participant's open stock loan positions to the transferee participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before permitting a participant to retire, DTC will verify that the participant has closed out all its entitlements
and obligations for future distributions created by stock loans. If DTC ceases to act for a participant, DTC will determine
which other DTC participants are stock loan counterparties and will adjust those participants' stock loan memo account
positions in order to balance the elimination of DTC's obligations and rights to or from the terminated participant.
The counterparties' legal obligations or rights with respect to the terminated participant will not be changed DTC's
action. However, because DTC will cease allocating distributions attributable to the terminated participant's
transactions, remaining counterparty participants will have to make arrangements outside DTC to receive or pay
future distributions on any stock loans with the terminated participant that remains open after DTC has ceased to
act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the stock loan income-tracking system is implemented, DTC will provide a means for participants to load DTC's
stock loan data base with information about currently outstanding stock loans. Deliveries made after implementation
with a stock loan reason code will automatically be added to this data base.

The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder because it is an automated procedure that will eliminate inefficient income processing by stock loan
counterparties. The proposed rule change also is consistent with DTC's obligation under Section 17A to safeguard
securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible because the proposal provides reports
and inquiry functions to participants for their review and reconciliation and provides for the termination of future
DTC obligations upon a participants's voluntary or involuntary termination of its membership.

DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DTC's plan to investigate the automation of stock loan income processing was announced to participants in the 1991
DTC Program Agenda which described a stock loan tracking system, similar to DTC's repurchase agreement tracking,
that would monitor participant stock loan positions and automatically credit the lender instead of the borrower
with dividends or interest due. The system was also noted in the 1992 and 1993 Program Agendas. DTC held a series of meetings
with approximately ten broker and bank participants to solicit their comments on plans for the stock loan income-tracking
system. These comments were incorporated into the final design of the proposed system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments received on the 1991 Program Agenda included comments from thirteen participants and others on
stock loan income-tracking system. (No comments were received on either the 1992 or 1993 Program Agenda entry.)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Two of those comments raised issues to which responses follow. In its November 27, 1991, comment letter, the Securities
Industry Association asked whether DTC could assist participants with the monitoring of substitute payments by
a special report. In response, DTC notes that in the proposed system income payments will be coded as stock loan payments
on DTC's reports to participants, and the participant will have the ability to identify stock loan income payments
on electronic files. In its December 18, 1991, comment letter, the New York Clearing House recommended that DTC develop
access to the stock loan income-tracking service through DTC's computer-to-computer facility and mainframe dual
host as well as through PTS. In response, DTC notes that the reason codes on DOs that will trigger stock loan income-tracking
are accepted by all three means of DO input.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each Member of the Corporation is required to contribute to the Clearing Fund maintained by the Corporation an amount
approximately equal to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[(i) 3% of the Member's average daily settlement debits]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Gross Debit Value shall equal the largest single daily gross debit value minus 15% of the INS receive value for that
day, calculated in dollars, based on debit values for the calendar week following the week in which the calculation
is performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Market Risk Factor shall be the largest calculated percentage change over 11 days in the Financial Times Index
over a minimum of 365 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Foreign Exchange Factor shall be equal to: (Gross Debit Value&times;Estimated Foreign Exchange Volatility)
minus (Gross Debit Value&times;Market Risk Factor&times;Estimated Foreign Exchange Volatility)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Estimated Foreign Exchange Volatility shall be the largest one day percentage change in the US Dollar_British
Pound foreign exchange rate over a minimum of 365 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rovided, however, that each Member shall be required to contribute a minimum of $50,000 (the ``minimum contribution'').
The first $50,000 of a Member's contribution is required to be in cash unless all or part of the Member's open account
indebtedness is collateralized with Letters of Credit, in which case, the first $100,000 of the Member's contribution
is required to be in cash.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The proposed rule change consists of a change of ISCC's clearing fund formula. ISCC's responsibility to the London
Stock Exchange under the linkage agreement is to pay for securities delivered. ISCC has no responsibility to complete
open pending trades. ISCC's current Clearing Fund calculation therefore is based on the ISCC member's average daily
gross settlement debits and takes into consideration purchases due for settlement and purchases which have failed
to settle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To cover ISCC's market risk exposure, ISCC has been collecting 21/2% of the average gross settlement value over two
account periods (this 21/2% reflected the calculated market risk exposure in 1986). Because trades are executed
in pounds and ISCC would be required to purchase pounds to meet the settlement obligation, ISCC also has been collecting
a percentage of the gross settlement value to cover the foreign exchange risk. This has amounted to .5%. Since trades
currently settle on a fortnightly settlement basis, the Clearing Fund has been calculated and collected on a bi-weekly
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the London Stock Exchange moves to a ten day rolling settlement cycle on July 18, 1994, trades will settle on a daily
basis ten days after trade date. ISCC will continue to be obligated to pay for securities which are delivered to members
in the event that the members are unable to complete their settlement obligation. ISCC still will have market risk
and foreign exchange risk, but the period of time to which ISCC will be subject to these risks will change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To adequately cover ISCC's exposure, the clearing fund deposit will be calculated and collected on a weekly basis.
The formula will be based on trades which are due to settle in the week following the calculation. Calculations will
be made each Tuesday, and ISCC members will be required to deposit additional amounts within three days. This process
will permit ISCC to collect clearing fund deposits prior to the settlement of the transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula will take into consideration the largest daily gross debit obligation, for trades due to settle in the
week following the calculation, offset by a percentage for Institutional Net Settlement Participant (``INSP'')
redeliveries. The debits will be offset only partially since these items may be reclaimed by the receiver, and in such
circumstance ISCC will be liable to the London Stock Exchange for the full value of the reclamation. ISCC will apply
a market risk factor and foreign exchange risk factor to this debit obligation. Initially the factors will be determined
as set forth below and will be reviewed annually thereafter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine the appropriate percentage for market risk, ISCC will review the Financial Times Index and assume that
it will take one day to sell all positions. Based on a ten day settlement cycle this will result in 11 days elapsing from
trade date to close out date. Accordingly, the formula will take into consideration the largest price movement over
an 11 day period. Initially ISCC will use the largest price movement in 1993 of 7% for the market risk factor component
of the formula.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate the foreign exchange risk, ISCC will review the daily rate fluctuation for the exchange rate between
the British Pound and U.S. Dollars. Initially, ISCC will use data from the 1989&hyph;1992 period and the maximum fluctuation
during that time was 4.445%. This number will be used on the foreign exchange factor component of the formula.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Clearing Fund Requirements for ISCC members on surveillance are increased, in the discretion of the Corporation,
by requiring up to an additional 3%, 5%, and 7% of average daily debits for members on Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance,
respectively. The same increases (of three, five, and seven percent for Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance)
will be retained under the new formula, only they will be added to the Market Risk Factor and Foreign Exchange Risk Factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The proposed rule changes will permit ISCC to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control and is therefore
consistent with Section 17A of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to allow OCC to convert its Delivery Versus Payment (``DVP'') authorization
process to an on-line system. The changes proposed herein will require OCC's clearing members to submit DVP authorization
instructions to OCC via electronic means and, thereby, will eliminate the use of paper DVP authorization forms and
the need for clearing members to make physical delivery of such forms to OCC's offices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DVP authorization is an alternate settlement procedure for the settlement of foreign currency options and cross-rate
foreign currency options.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to the DVP authorization process, a clearing member's approved DVP bank guarantee to OCC's agent bank delivery
on the exercise settlement date of either a designated quantity of foreign currency against payment of a specified
sum of U.S. dollars or a specified sum of U.S. dollars against delivery of a designated quantity of a foreign currency.
The current DVP authorization process is a batch system which begins on the first business day following exercise
when a clearing member brings a completed multipart DVP authorization form to the OCC operations window on the business
day following exercise.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Following submission of the DVP form to OCC, the clearing member must wait until notified by OCC that the DVP instructions
have been accepted. OCC accepts DVP instructions after verifying that the form has been filled out correctly and that
the DVP amounts are valid.

Currently, OCC maintains offices in Chicago and New York. Clearing members located in cities other than Chicago and
New York send the DVP authorization form to OCC's Chicago office via facsimile and later send the hard copy form.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the DVP instructions have been accepted, OCC returns a copy of the form to the clearing member. Upon receiving
the accepted DVP form, the initiating clearing member must deliver a copy of the accepted DVP form to its own agent bank.
OCC transmits the DVP instructions to its own agent bank through an electronic communications link. In addition to
transmitting the DVP information via computer, OCC sends a hard copy DVP log to its agent bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the second business day following exercise, the clearing member's DVP agent bank must send a SWIFT or tested telex
message to OCC's agent bank guaranteeing payment of dollar and/or foreign currency settlement amounts to OCC's agent
bank or OCC's correspondent bank. On the third business day following exercise, OCC's agent bank must confirm to OCC
that the guarantee message from the clearing member's DVP agent bank was received. OCC receives confirmation from
its agent bank via facsimile. On the fourth business day following exercise, the clearing member's DVP agent bank
must make an irrevocable transfer of U.S. dollars and/or foreign currency to the designated OCC agent bank or OCC's
correspondent bank in the country of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current DVP processing system is a manually intensive and time consuming process. Accordingly, OCC is proposing
to convert the DVP authorization process to an on-line system. OCC is proposing to accomplish this goal in two Phases.
Phase 1 will require clearing members to submit DVP instructions to OCC and receive confirmations of acceptance from
OCC via electronic means. This change would eliminate the paper DVP authorization form and the need for clearing members
to physically deliver such forms to OCC. In Phase 2, OCC will propose changes which will allow members to submit DVP
messages to their DVP agency banks via electronic means a well. This filing, File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;93&hyph;17,
seeks to make the changes necessary to accomplish only Phase 1.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will require clearing members to submit and receive electronic DVP messages to and from OCC
through the use of the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS'').
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The on-line DVP instructions will contain the same information currently required on the DVP authorization form.
Once an on-line DVP instruction is entered, the same verification/acceptance process currently performed by OCC
staff will be performed through C/MACS. The clearing member will receive an on-line confirmation of acceptance message
shortly after entering the DVP instruction. In addition, the clearing member will be able to inquire about the status
of a DVP instruction by viewing an on-line screen.

C/MACS is a fully automated participant terminal system which allows clearing members to submit reports, notices,

capabilities of C/MACS, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20983 (May 22, 1984), 49 FR 22427 [Filed No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;83&hyph;15]

Once the clearing member's DVP instruction has been entered and accepted and OCC has completed its processing, the
clearing member will be able to print an OCC C/MACS-generated authorization report from its own computer terminal.
This new report will replace the DVP authorization form and will contain all of the information currently on the DVP
authorization form with the exception of an OCC signature. The clearing member will be required to deliver the C/MACS-generated
report to its DVP agent bank and to direct such DVP agent bank to issue a SWIFT or tested telex message to OCC's agent bank
guaranteeing delivery or payment, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the DVP authorization instruction
contained in the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC will send a message to its own agent bank through an electronic communications link to confirm the terms of the accepted
DVP instructions. Following receipt of the guarantee message from the clearing member's DVP agent bank, OCC's agent
bank or correspondent bank will carry out its payment or delivery obligation to the recipient named in the DVP authorization
instruction on the exercise settlement date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the proposed changes to OCC Rules 1606A and 2107 will require clearing members to submit DVP instructions
to OCC through on-line transmissions.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Other specific changes are also being made. Language is being added to Rule 1606A(b) to clarify that a clearing member's
``agent bank'' is an approved bank acting on its behalf. The additional language will make the language of Rule 1606A(b)
consistent with the language of Rule 2107(b).

Rules 1606A and 2107 set forth the DVP settlement procedures for foreign currency options and cross-rate foreign

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rules 1606A(c) and 2107(c) are being amended to reflect an operational change in OCC's DVP processing. Currently,
a clearing member may specifically elect to apply a DVP instruction to settle all or part of a gross settlement obligation
or a net settlement obligation. Under the proposed on-line system, a clearing member will not be permitted to elect
whether its DVP instruction is applied to a gross settlement obligation or a net settlement obligation. Rather, the
system will automatically apply the DVP instruction to the clearing member's gross settlement obligation and then
adjust the clearing member's remaining net settlement obligation accordingly. This remaining net settlement obligation
will then settle through the regular settlement procedures pursuant to Rule 1606.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rules 1606A(d) and 2107(d) are being amended to provide that OCC's confirmation of acceptance of the clearing member's
DVP authorization instruction will be carried out through an on-line confirmation message from OCC to the clearing
member rather than by OCC's signature on a DVP form. Rules 1606A(f) and 2107(f) are being amended to provide that the
clearing member must deliver to its agent bank a C/MACS-generated DVP report that contains the approved DVP instructions
instead of the OCC-endorsed DVP form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, an interpretation is being added both to Rule 1606A and to Rule 2107 to provide that should unusual or unforeseen
circumstances prevent a clearing member from submitting DVP instructions by on-line data entry prior to any applicable
cut-off time, OCC in its discretion may require the clearing member to submit such item by other approved means, including
the use of hard copy forms, and/or may extend the applicable cut-off time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the development of the on-line DVP system, extensive testing was undertaken to assess the operational impact
of the new on-line system. Based on OCC's testing of the on-line CVP system, OCC has determined that the implementation
of the on-line DVP authorization process should not stress OCC's current processing systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to security, internal and external controls have been put in place to ensure the integrity of the data
and the software of the product. Data security is maintained through security software. In addition, OCC's Security
Administration Department develops, reviews, and maintains appropriate security guidelines and standards. The
integrity of OCC's operating systems is maintained through limited access to central systems libraries. Physical
access to OCC's systems is restricted to those employees that require access. Finally, on-line access is restricted
to users with authorized log-in IDs and passwords.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to contingency procedures, OCC has adequate back-up procedures in place to ensure the timely continuation
of DVP processing in the event that any problem develops with respect to the on-line system. For instance, if C/MACS
were not functioning properly, OCC could permit a clearing member to enter the DVP instructions at one of OCC's offices
or to submit hard copy forms. Furthermore, if a system failure were to prevent a clearing member from submitting any
DVP instruction through on-line data entry prior to any applicable cut-off time, OCC could extend such cut-off time
by such period as OCC deemed reasonable, practicable, and equitable under the circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act because it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by substantially
reducing the paperwork associated with the DVP settlement process. OCC believes that this first step in converting
the DVP authorization process to an on-line system will make the system operationally more efficient and will reduce
the time delays inherent in a system using paper forms. Furthermore, OCC believes that it has sufficiently considered
capacity, security, and contingency issues in its development of the on-line DVP authorization system and that the
proposed on-line DVP system should in no way pose a threat to the integrity or security of OCC's current processing
systems.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), this document announces the Office
of Personnel Management's (OPM) request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance of proposed job
application procedures. These procedures would replace the SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, which is
being discontinued as recommended by the National Performance Review. The proposed procedures described in this
notice were recommended by an interagency task force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To allow time to implement the proposed procedures, OMB has approved an extension of the authorization of SF 171 and
related forms through September 30, 1994. OPM has further requested that authorization for these forms be extended
through December 31, 1994. The procedures proposed in this notice would take effect on January 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM estimates that the public reporting burden to file a Federal job application would vary from 10 minutes to 240 minutes
with an average of 40 minutes. OPM estimates that the public reporting burden to file the Declaration for Federal Employment
would vary from 5 minutes to 60 minutes with an average time of 15 minutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary of Process To Replace SF 171
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, has been the primary form used by individuals to apply for Federal
jobs since 1968. However, the National Performance Review (NPR) recommended eliminating standard application
forms, such as the SF 171, which is considered a barrier to attracting workers to the Federal service because it is long
and complex. Therefore, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to replace the SF 171 with an approach that
allows applicants to use a resume or other form of written application they choose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM and agencies need to collect information on education, work experience, and personal background that is necessary
to determine an applicant's qualifications, eligibility, and fitness for Federal employment. OPM and agency authority
to collect this information is primarily in sections 1104, 1302, 3301, 3304, 3320, 3361, 3393, and 3394 of Title 5,
United States Code, covering employment in the competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service,
including selection from among current and former Federal employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the NPR recommendation, OPM convened an interagency task force, representing 16 agencies, which recommended
new application procedures described in this notice. OPM sought comments on implementing these recommendations
from the National Partnership Council, the Interagency Advisory Group (personnel directors from more than 90 agencies),
unions holding national consultation rights with OPM, and organizations representing major constituent groups.
The resulting approach provides:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Alternative methods for agencies to collect information from job applicants (written, telephone, and automated
techniques);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicant choices in how they submit written applications;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Two new optional forms and an information flyer for use beginning in 1995; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The separation of qualifications and suitability information in applications.

Temporary Extension of SF 171 and Related Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. To allow sufficient time to implement the proposed application procedures, OMB has extended the authorization
for the following standard forms through September 30, 1994, and is considering OPM's request for extension through
December 31, 1994:

Proposed Procedures for Federal Job Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of these proposed application procedures is to make it easier for individuals to apply for Federal jobs and
to present their qualifications in a manner they believe will enhance their job opportunities. At the same time, the
proposal would provide methods for agencies to obtain sufficient information to evaluate job applicants. So that
the public reporting burden may be reduced and agencies may better protect privacy of individuals by restricting
access to more sensitive background data, qualifications information would be collected separately from suitability
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Agency Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies could request and collect applicant data electronically or through printed vacancy/examination announcements
(and supplements to them), and paper resume/applications. Electronic media include (but are not liimited to) applications
filed by telephone as well as data that applicants provide on computer scannable forms. (See paragraph 6 on agency
specific forms for use with electronic systems.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the method used, agencies would be authorized to collect necessary information of the type they currently
collect from job applicants, for example: Identification, including name, address, social security number, date
of birth, phone numbers. Job related qualifications, such as work experience, education, minimum college credits
for professional positions, training, licenses, accomplishments, evidence of specialized knowledge, skills,
and abilities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal information to satisfy general legal requirements, when applicable, such as citizenship, veterans' preference,
minimum and maximum age requirements, and proof of competitive status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant preferences, where applicable, such as work location, work schedule, type of employment (permanent or
temporary). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To tell applicants what information to include in their resumes/applications, we propose to issue a flyer called
Applying for a Federal Job. The flyer also alerts applicants that fraudulent statements can be punished by fine or
imprisonment, job finalists will be asked to certify the accuracy of their statements, and in some instances all applicants
may be required to provide this certification. (A copy of the flyer is appended to this notice.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flyer would be widely available through OPM's field offices, agency personnel offices, State Employment Service
offices, and other organizations that deal with Federal job seekers. Printed versions could be purchased through
the General Services Administration or could be obtained from OPM's electronic bulletin boards without charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies could incorporate in their vacancy announcements the information requested in the flyer and could request
any other job-related information required by the position(s) to be filled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposition of incomplete applications would be subject to individual agency policy, as is currently the case. Each
agency determines whether incomplete applications will be rejected, evaluated to the extent possible, or subject
to follow up for additional information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Applicant Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning January 1, 1995, applicants could choose the format of their written applications, for example, a resume,
the optional application discussed in paragraph 5, or any other written application an individual chooses. Individuals
may have a supply of SF 171 forms or SF 171 computer software; such applications would be acceptable if applicants chose
to use them (but an agency could not require SF 171).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist applicants in preparing their resumes/applications, the proposed flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, shows
the types of information agencies require for evaluating job applicants (see paragraph 3). For applicants who prefer
a more structured approach, the proposed optional application form would be available, as discussed in paragraph
5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. New Optional Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two new optional forms are proposed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. ``Optional Application for Federal Employment'' is a simplified application for individuals who prefer a form.
It would be particularly useful for applicants who do not have extensive job-related qualifications, such as recent
graduates or applicants for entry or wage grade positions. (The form would have a short tear-off sheet with brief instructions
and the Privacy Act and Public Burden Statements). This optional application contains information considered to
be the minimum necessary to determine an applicant's qualifications. (The information requested parallels the
contents of the flyer described in paragraph 3.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the intent of this proposal is to give applicants flexibility in preparing job applications, Federal agencies
could not require all applicants to use the optional application form, except where the agency had developed a computer-compatible
version of the optional application. This exception is necessary because automated systems usually can operate
only with specific formats and questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The optional application would be widely available through OPM field offices, agency personnel offices, Statement
Employment Service offices, and other organizations that deal with Federal job seekers. Printed versions could
be purchased through the General Services Administration or the form could be obtained without charge on a computer
file from OPM's electronic bulletin boards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. ``Declaration for Federal Employment'' would be used primarily to collect information on conduct and suitability,
and also on other matters, such as receipt of a government annuity. (The form would have a short tear-off sheet with
brief instructions and the Privacy Act and Public Burden Statements.) Agencies would have the option of asking applicants
to complete this optional form at any time during the hiring process, but it would be required of all appointees. We
anticipate that, in most cases, only the final few applicants who have a good chance of receiving a job offer would complete
the form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another important purpose of the Declaration for Federal Employment would be to warn applicants of the consequences
of submitting fraudulent information and to ask them to certify the accuracy of all their application materials.
At the time of appointment, individuals would again be asked to sign a certification so that they could indicate any
changes that occurred between the date of the initial certification and date of appointment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(This certification for appointees is a part of the existing SF 61&hyph;B, Declaration of Appointee. The SF 61&hyph;B,
which also contains suitability and insurance questions, would be replaced in 1995 by the proposed Declaration for
Federal Employment.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM has proposed a 3-year expiration date (the maximum permitted under the Paperwork Reduction Act) for both the optional
application and declaration form. We also propose that the expiration date not be displayed on the forms because of
the anticipated large volume that would be in circulation at any time. Samples of both forms are appended to this notice.

6. Agency-Specific Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent a proliferation of government application forms and the resulting burden to the public, OMB and OPM would
encourage agencies to use the process described in this notice. We anticipate that only rarely would agencies need
an agency-specific form, for example, when necessary for an electronic application system or for unique occupations
with highly specialized requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies are required by the Paperwork Reduction Act to obtain OMB approval of any agency-specific application form
required from ten or more persons who are not agency employees. The Act does not preclude an agency, however, from developing
its own form for required use by its current employees. Also, agencies would not need OMB approval to develop a computer-compatible
(but otherwise identical) version of the Optional Application for Federal Employment and require its use by all applicants.
Use of a non-identical computer-compatible application would require OMB approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Agency-Specific Questions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the information items listed in paragraph 3, agencies would be permitted to add any of the following
three items, if applicable, to the information they request for applicants. These items are unique to certain agencies
or positions and, therefore, are not included on the proposed optional forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Spouse Preference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 806 of the Defense Authorization Act, 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;145), the Department of Defense must give
preference in hiring to military spouses. To determine eligibility and extend preference, the Department of Defense
may ask the following question. Without this information, Defense could not comply with the preference requirement.
The question may be included in any document of Defense's choosing, for example, a vacancy announcement or as an addition
to one of the proposed forms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Child Care Workers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647) requires that employment applications for Federal
child care positions contain a question asking whether the individual has ever been arrested for or charged with a
crime involving a child and for the disposition of the arrest or charge. Also, the application containing this information
must state that it is being signed under penalty of perjury, and identify the penalty. The law requires the hiring agency
to obtain the applicant's signed receipt of notice that a criminal record check will be conducted and that the applicant
has a right to review and challenge the accuracy of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assure compliance with this law, agencies may add the following question to the Declaration for Federal Employment
for applicants for child care positions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Have you ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child? If ``Yes,'' provide the date, explanation
of the violation, disposition of the arrest or charge, place of occurrence, and the name and address of the police department
or court involved. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Federal agency is required by law to conduct a criminal check. In addition to the purposes explained in blocks 16 and
18, your signature also certifies that (1) your response to this question is made under penalty of perjury, which is
punishable by (insert Federal punishment for perjury); and (2) you have received notice that a criminal check will
be conducted, of your right to obtain a copy of the criminal history report made available to the employing Federal
agency, and of your right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in the report.

c. Indian Child Care Workers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 408 of the Miscellaneous Indian Legislation (Pub. L. 101&hyph;630) contains a related requirement for positions
at the Departments of Interior and Health and Human Services that involve regular contact with or control over Indian
children. The agencies must ensure that persons hired for these positions have not been found guilty of or pleaded
nolo contendere to violet crimes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure compliance with both Pub. L. 101&hyph;630 and Pub. L. 101&hyph;647, Interior and Health and Human Services
may add the following question to the Declaration for Federal Employment, for positions that involve regular contact
with or control over Indian children: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Have you ever (1) been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child, and/or (2) been found guilty of, or entered
a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any offense under Federal, State, or tribal law involving crimes of violence;
sexual assault, molestation, explanation, contact or prostitution; or crimes against persons? If ``Yes,'' provide
the date, explanation of the violation, disposition of the arrest or charge, place of occurrence, and the name and
address of the police department or court involved.

8. OPM Form 1203
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM uses computer-assisted techniques to rate job applicants. Applicants are asked to complete OPM Form 1203, optical
scan forms designed to collect applicant information and qualifications in a format suitable for automated processing.
Different but very similar versions of the form are used, depending on the occupation or automated system being used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1203 forms are essential to operation of our automated application processing systems and their use is consistent
with recommendations of the National Performance Review. However, the current version of Form 1203 contains suitability
questions that parallel questions 38&hyph;43 of the SF 171. OPM proposes to revise Form 1203 to remove all suitability
questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM has requested that OMB approve the revised OPM Form 1203 series for a 3-year period beginning January 1, 1995. The
expiration date of the current form is March 31, 1995. Because of the high level of current stock and the possibility
that a supply of the revised form may not be available by January 1995, OPM plans to continue using the current version
of Form 1203 until supplies are exhausted on March 31, 1995, whichever occurs first. Beginning January 1, 1995, OPM
would instruct applicants not to answer the suitability questions and would not enter any responses in our automated
systems. A representative sample of OPM Form 1203 is appended to this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM also requests OMB approval of its telephone application system, the Telephone Application Processing System
(TAPS). OPM has been evaluating TAPS as an NPR reinvention laboratory project. TAPS will greatly expedite the application
process by utilizing the latest in telephone and microcomputer technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through TAPS, applicants will be able to apply directly over the telephone for Federal employment. They will be instructed
to provide answers to questions using a combination of voice recordings and the keys of a touch-tone telephone. The
questions cover minimum qualification requirements, that is, education and/or experience, citizenship, job interest,
etc. These responses will be transcribed and computer-rated within a day. The names of applicants who are rated eligible
will be placed immediately on a referral list for consideration when Federal agencies have jobs to fill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Professional Nurse and Border Patrol Agent positions are operating under TAPS. A representative script
(Nurse) of the TAPS application is appended to this notice.

``Welcome. You have reached the U.S. Government's telephone application processing system. We are pleased that
you have contacted us about nursing positions with the Federal Government. This application system will ask you a

and start over. If you are not sure of the information at this time, you may hang-up and call again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
