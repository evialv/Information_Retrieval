SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bovine tuberculosis is the contagious, infectious, and communicable disease caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tuberculosis regulations, contained in 9 CFR part 77 (referred to below as the regulations), regulate the interstate
movement of cattle and bison because of tuberculosis. Cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis
are eligible for interstate movement without restriction if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated
as accredited-free States or modified accredited States. The regulations restrict the interstate movement of cattle
or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions
designated as nonmodified accredited States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of a State is based on its freedom from evidence of tuberculosis, the effectiveness of the State's tuberculosis
eradication program, and the degree of the State's compliance with the standards contained in the ``Uniform Methods
and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' which is part of the regulations via incorporation by reference in
part 77. A State must have no findings of tuberculosis in any cattle or bison in the State for at least 5 years in order
to be designated as an accredited-free State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before publication of this interim rule, New York was designated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;77.1 of the regulations as a modified accredited State. However, New York now meets the requirements for designation
as an accredited-free State. Therefore, we are amending the regulations by removing New York from the list of modified
accredited States in &sect;77.1 and adding it to the list of accredited-free States in that section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediate Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted, as New York currently
meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free State. This action provides prospective cattle and bison
buyers with accurate and up-to-date information, which may affect the marketability of cattle and bison since some
prospective buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 21,000 cattle herds in New York, with a total of about 1,560,000 cattle. An estimated 90 percent
of these herds are owned by small entities. Changing the status of New York may affect the marketability of cattle and
bison from the State, since some prospective cattle and bison buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free
States. This may result in some beneficial economic impact on some small entities. However, based on our experience
in similar designations of other States, the impact should not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict the importation into the
United States of certain animals and birds to prevent the introduction of communicable livestock and poultry diseases,
including bovine tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bovine tuberculosis is a serious communicable disease of cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused
by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as TB) causes weight loss, general debilitation, and sometimes death. This
disease manifests itself as lung disease or draining, nonhealing abscesses, or both. It is generally transmitted
by breathing in respiratory excretions from infected animals or drinking infected milk from infected animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Zealand has reported that TB is endemic in the brushtail possum (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichosurus vulpecula
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These possums are a constant source of disease for the domestic livestock population of New Zealand. Based upon
information received from the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and information available in scientific
literature, we recently prepared a risk assessment regarding the importation of brushtail possums from New Zealand
into the United States. This risk assessment indicates that 45.8 percent (range 7.2 percent to 67.4 percent) of consignments
of imported brushtail possums (generally imported in 4 consignments of 12 animals each) would contain 1 or more possums
infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Additionally, there is no recognized test for detecting TB in brushtail possums. These factors present a significant
risk that TB-infected brushtail possums from New Zealand could be imported into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because hedgehogs from New Zealand occupy the same habitat and geographical areas as the brushtail possums, there
is some risk that hedgehogs could contract TB from TB-infected possums. Also, as with the brushtail possums, there
is no recognized test for detecting TB in hedgehogs. These factors present an unacceptable risk that TB-infected
hedgehogs from New Zealand could be imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been a number of importations of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States.
Both these animals could likely survive and thrive in the wild in much of the United States. If infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and allowed to roam freely, these animals could disseminate the TB organism over range and pasture land. Consuming
grass contaminated with the TB organism by TB-infected brushtail possums is the major mode of TB infection in cattle
in New Zealand. To prevent a similar situation in the United States, we are amending the regulations by adding a new
subpart G to prohibit the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction
of TB into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule prohibits the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States. These
animals are imported as pets, for animal exhibitions, and for petting zoos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulating the importation of certain animals that pose a disease risk to livestock in the United States is a continuing
program. Discontinuing the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand will have no significant
cost impacts, but it will produce a benefit by helping to protect domestic livestock from this disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of TB in domestic cattle remains relatively small; however, it has increased slightly in the past several
years. Most of the incidences have occurred in States that share a border with Mexico. Mexican-origin cattle accounted
for 83 percent of all TB lesions disclosed at slaughter in 1992. There are very few cases of TB in the rest of the country.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inventory of all cattle and calves in the United States is estimated at 101.7 million head, with an estimated value
of almost $67 billion. Nationwide, there are approximately 1.2 million operations with cattle and calves, according
to USDA data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic impact on the domestic cattle industry if TB-infected brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand
were imported into the United States would be severe. The annual costs in New Zealand for possum damage (for example,
damage to the environment and bovine TB attributable to the brushtail possum), disease surveillance, control and
research probably exceed $20 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, there are probably two known importers of brushtail possums and hedgehogs
from New Zealand. These importers would be considered small entities under the Small Business Administration criteria.
Although the Fish and Wildlife Service could not provide data on the actual number of imported brushtail possums and
hedgehogs imported from New Zealand into the United States by these importers, the Service has stated that these animals
represent a very small percent of the total number of animals imported into the United States by these importers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to provide that persons requesting a hearing in certain
materials license proceedings must file their requests within 30 days of receiving actual notice of the pendency
of the license application, or, if the person does not learn about the application until it has been granted, within
30 days of receiving actual notice of the grant of the application. No hearing requests filed more than 180 days after
the grant of the application will be entertained. The amendment applies only to materials licensing actions which
are not of sufficient importance to warrant notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The rule change eliminates an ambiguous provision in the Commission's current regulations and serves to ensure
that hearing requests are filed as promptly as possible, in order to promote the timely identification and resolution
of problems with or objections to proposed licensing actions.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's rules governing informal hearing procedures of adjudications on materials licenses are set forth
in subpart L to part 2. When the rules do not require the Commission to publish notice of all proposed licensing actions,
the requirements for requesting a hearing are tied to the date on which a requester receives actual notice of such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to this rule change, the regulation stated that if 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of an action is not published, then a request for a hearing must be filed within ``the earlier of_(i) Thirty (30)
days after the requestor receives actual notice of a pending application or an agency action granting an application;
or (ii) One hundred and eighty (180) days after agency action granting an application.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August, 1992, the presiding officer in a materials licensing proceeding was faced with a case in which a requester
with actual notice of a license application filed in 1989 waited to ask for a hearing until the NRC granted the application,
three and a half years later. The licensee and the NRC staff objected that the request should have been filed within
30 days of the requester's receiving actual notice of the application. (In other words, they were arguing that the
rule was meant to allow persons to file within 30 days of receiving actual notice of the grant of an application only
if they were unaware until then of the pendency of the application.) The requester responded that the regulation contained
no such implicit condition, and instead gave requesters a choice: Either they could file within 30 days of receiving
actual notice of the application, or they could wait until the grant of the application and then file within 30 days
of learning of the agency's action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presiding officer sustained the requester's position. He observed that the NRC staff and the licensee were in
effect arguing that the regulation should be read as though it required the request to be filed at the earliest of three
events: 30 days after receipt of actual notice of the filing of the application; 30 days after receipt of actual notice
of the grant of the application; and 180 days after the grant of the application. He added that the Statement of Considerations
accompanying the rule had referred to requests for hearing being timely if filed within 30 days of a requester's receiving
actual notice ``of a licensing action.'' The presiding officer offered a possible rationale for the two separate
windows of opportunity: a potential requester, hopeful that an application might not be approved, would not have
to file a hearing request until the grant of the application eliminated doubt as to the NRC's intent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission did not disturb the presiding officer's ruling, but it directed the staff to prepare a proposed rule
that would make clear that requesters are indeed required to file at the earliest of the three events described above.
Such a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Analysis of Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received on the proposed rule, but neither one was directed to the actual subject of the rulemaking,
i.e., whether the NRC should continue to allow someone with actual knowledge of an application to wait for that application
to be granted before requesting a hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first comment, from Kerr-McGee Corporation, endorsed the proposed rule, but noted that the new language ``seemingly
leaves the door open for filing of requests for hearing almost at will.'' Kerr-McGee asserted that the rule is hinged
on when the requester ``receives actual notice,'' an ``ambiguous'' term that ``is not related to the time an actual
amendment application is filed.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The response to this comment is that the NRC's proposed rule was directed to a specific and narrow issue_whether a potential
requester with actual notice of an application should be able to delay filing a hearing request until the application
is granted. The notice did not contemplate revising the rule to change the concept of making the receipt of actual notice
the basis of the time for filing a hearing request.

2. Comment of Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second comment was from Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE), which objected to the portion of the regulation
that bars petitions filed more than 180 days after the NRC's grant of an application. OCRE asserted that it was conceivable
that someone would not learn of a licensing action until after the passage of 180 days, and would by then, through no
fault of his or her own, have lost all opportunity to request a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE's point, like Kerr-McGee's, goes beyond the scope of the quite narrow change that the NRC proposed. The Commission's
notice made clear that the issue to be resolved was whether potential requesters with actual notice of an application
for a particular licensing action were intended to have two bites at the apple, or should instead be required to file
for a hearing at their earliest opportunity. The concept of a 180-day cutoff was never identified as being subject
to reconsideration by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having considered the comments received, and finding that neither of them suggests a flaw in the specific correction
proposed in the rule, the Commission has determined that the following final rule should be promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule sets forth the time frame
within which a person other than an applicant must file a request for a hearing in a licensing proceeding held under
the informal procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 2, subpart L. The rule does not impose any obligations on regulated
entities that may fall within the definition of ``small entities'' as set forth in section 601(3) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, or within the definition of ``small business'' as found in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15
U.S.C. 632, or within the small business size standards contained in 13 CFR part 121.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 3, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Texarkana, AR, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63903). Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower is closed. The proposal
was to establish Class E airspace to contain IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Other than editorial changes, this amendment is adopted as proposed.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Texarkana, AR. Controlled
airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action establishes Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 18 Standard
Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Fayette County Airport has recently been developed. Controlled airspace
extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed to contain Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations
at the airport. The operating status of the airport will change from Visual Flight Rule (VFR) to include IFR operations
concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for
pilots.

On March 31, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 18 Standard Instrument Approach
Procedure (SIAP) was developed for the Fayette County Airport at Somerville, Tennessee (59 FR 15136). The proposal
was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled
airspace and to change the operating status of the airport from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent
with the publication of the SIAP. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by
submitting written comments on the proposal to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). No comments objecting
to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations established Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee,
to provide controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface for aircraft executing an NDB SIAP into the Fayette
County Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is updating and clarifying its regulations relating to
public use of records and donated historical materials that have been transferred to NARA. Most of the changes in this
regulation merely clarify existing practices and will have no significant impact upon the public. Changes in research
room rules, such as requiring a picture identification when applying for a research card and prohibiting ink pens
and chewing gum in rooms where original records are present, are intended to provide greater protection for the historically
valuable holdings of NARA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in its proposed rule published on October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54540), NARA is making some minimal changes in research
room rules. We received three comments to these proposed rule changes. The three comments were received from customers
who use the regional archives. Since many researchers in the regions travel long distances, they felt the proposed
3-hour limit and ``first come first served'' policy for use of microfilm readers would create a ``hardship'' to their
research. Currently, some regional archives allow reservations of microfilm readers and impose time limits on use
that reflect local demand for the equipment. NARA is amending this rule to give the regional archive directors the
discretion to modify this new rule in a way that benefits the users of their facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;1254.26, we have made two additional nonsubstantive changes. We updated the title, Reference Services
Branch Chief, to reflect a reorganization of the unit responsible for the research rooms. The revised title is Director,
User Services Division. We have also clarified the procedure in &sect;1254.26(a) concerning permission for research
privileges for students under the age of 16 to state explicitly that prospective student researchers are encouraged
to contact the National Archives in advance of their visit to determine their eligibility to do research. This reminder
should particularly assist out-of-town and foreign students in making their research plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all the records from the Pickett Street facility have moved to the new NARA facility in College Park, Maryland
(National Archives at College Park), all references to the Pickett Street facility have been changed to National
Archives at College Park. In addition, a reference has been added to self-service copiers in National Archives at
College Park for the records transferred from the National Archives Building and the Washington National Records
Center. Because this change affects only the location of records, and not any conditions on their use, and because
the location of the records was the subject of a separate rule making upon which public comment was invited (59 FR 6899),
these changes are being made final without prior notice of proposed rule making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule contains two information collections, application for researcher identification cards and request
to microfilm records, for which OMB approval has been received. This is not a significant regulation under Executive
Order 12866 and has not been reviewed by OMB. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified
that this rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.

(a) The research room attendant may limit the quantity of documents delivered to a researcher at one time. The researcher
must sign for the documents received and may be required to show his/her researcher identification card. The researcher
is responsible for the proper handling of and prevention of damage to all documents delivered to him/her until he/she
returns them. When the researcher is finished using the documents, the documents must be returned to the research
room attendant. The reference service slip that accompanies the documents to the research room must not be removed.
If asked to do so, the researcher must return documents as much as 15 minutes before closing time. Before leaving a research
room, even for a short time, a researcher must notify the research room attendant and place all documents in their proper
containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When microfilm is available on a self-service basis, research room attendants will assist researchers in identifying
research sources on microfilm and provide information concerning how to locate and retrieve the roll(s) of film containing
the information of interest. The researcher is responsible for retrieving and examining the roll(s). Unless a researcher
requires assistance in learning how to operate microfilm reading equipment, the researcher is expected to install
the microfilm on the reader. Unless otherwise permitted, a researcher is limited to one roll of microfilm at a time.
After using each roll, the researcher is responsible for refiling the roll of microfilm in the location from which
it was removed, unless instructed otherwise.

(a) Admission to research rooms in the National Archives Building, the Washington National Records Center, and the
National Archives at College Park facility at which original documents are made available is limited to individuals
examining and/or copying documents and other materials in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration.
Children under the age of 16 will not be admitted to these research rooms unless they have been granted research privileges
or are granted an exception to this provision to view specific documents that a parent or other accompanying adult
researcher is using. The exception will be granted by the Director of the User Services Division for a child who is able
to read and who will be closely supervised by the adult researcher while in the research room. Normally, such a child
will be admitted only for the short period required to view the documents. Unless otherwise permitted, children under
the age of 16 who have been granted special permission to accompany an adult using records may not actively participate
in research activities, e.g., removing, copying, or refiling documents. Students under the age of 16 who wish to perform
research on original documents must apply in person to the Director of the User Services Division and present a letter
of reference from a teacher. Such students may contact the National Archives by phone or letter in advance of their
visit to discuss their eligibility for research privileges. Students under the age of 16 who have been granted research
privileges will be required to be accompanied in the research room by an adult with similar privileges, unless the
Director of the User Services Division specifically waives this requirement with respect to individual researchers.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 31, 1992, the EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of certain organic hazardous air pollutants
from synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) production processes and seven other processes
which are part of major sources under section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act). This rulemaking is
commonly called the Hazardous Organic NESHAP or the HON. In the final action regarding the December 31, 1992 proposal,
which was signed on February 28, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994, EPA deferred taking final action regarding provisions applicable to medium storage vessels due
to the need to resolve an issue of statutory interpretation of section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Act. On March 9, 1994, EPA
reopened the comment period to request additional comment on the appropriate interpretation of this statutory provision
and the effect of that interpretation on the appropriate control requirements for medium storage vessels at facilities
subject to the HON.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action announces EPA's final decision regarding the interpretation of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A) for
purposes of the HON and the final decision regarding control provisions applicable to medium storage vessels in SOCMI
facilities subject to the HON. The decision announced in this action regarding the interpretation of Clean Air Act
section 112(d)(3)(A) for purposes of the HON will be presumptively followed in subsequent MACT rulemakings, but
it will not be binding. Although EPA believes that Congress intended one interpretation_referred to as the ``Higher
Floor Interpretation''_in Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A), EPA also believes that the Agency retains discretion
in important respects in setting Floors for MACT standards. EPA intends to exercise its discretion, within the statutory
framework, to promulgate MACT standards that best serve the public interest.

Public Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately 55 comment letters were received in response to the March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11018) reopening of the comment
period. The majority of these letters were from industries or industrial trade associations, arguing in favor of
the less stringent ``Lower Floor Interpretation.'' Environmental groups, State or local governments and labor
unions argued almost uniformly in favor of the more stringent ``Higher Floor Interpretation.'' The EPA considered
all public comments in framing the final policy for MACT floor determination and in selection of the requirements
for medium storage vessels. The major issues raised by the comments are addressed in this preamble. The EPA's responses
to all the comments can be found in docket A&hyph;90&hyph;19, Subcategory VI&hyph;B.

This section describes EPA's decision with respect to the interpretation of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A) for
purposes of this rulemaking. As set forth in more detail below, EPA believes that one of the interpretations of section
112(d)(3)(A)_referred to as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation''_is the better and more natural reading of the statutory
language.

Section 112(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act provides that Emissions standards promulgated under this subsection for existing
sources *&blank;*&blank;* shall not be less stringent *&blank;*&blank;* than_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that have recently achieved LAER are excluded from consideration. Id. (For categories or subcategories with fewer
than 30 sources, standards may not be less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing
5 sources.'' CAA section 112(d)(3)(B)). The minimum level of stringency defined by this language has come to be known
as the MACT Floor.

, EPA published a notice soliciting comment on ``the appropriate interpretation of'' section 112(d)(3)(A). Two
interpretations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d)(3)(A) were discussed. Under the first, referred to as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation,'' EPA would
look at emission limitations achieved by each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and average those
limitations. ``Average'' would be interpreted to mean a measure of central tendency such as the arithmetic mean or
median. (The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements
in the set. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of values,
when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second, ``Lower Floor Interpretation,'' EPA would look at the average emission limits achieved by each
of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and take the lowest. This second interpretation groups the
words ``average emission limitation'' into a single phrase, and asks what ``average emission limitation'' (accounting
for variability over time, or between different pollutants being emitted from a facility) is ``achieved by'' all
members of the best performing 12 percent.

B. EPA's Interpretation of Section 112(d)(3)(A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that the ``Higher Floor Interpretation'' is a better reading of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A)
than the ``Lower Floor Interpretation.'' This conclusion is based on a review of the statute, legislative history
and comments received in response to EPA's March 9 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Statutory Language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(d)(3)(A) requires that standards be no less stringent than ``*&blank;*&blank;* the average emission
limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources *&blank;*&blank;*''. The EPA believes
that the most natural and straightforward reading of this language would have EPA first determine the emission limitations
achieved by sources within the best performing 12 percent, and then average those limitations. This is the method
described above as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that if Congress had intended the Lower Floor Interpretation, language other than that actually
used in section 112(d)(3)(A) would have been far more natural. For example, Congress could easily have expressed
the Lower Floor Interpretation by requiring standards to be no less stringent than ``the emission limitation achieved
by all sources within the best performing 12 percent.'' Similarly, Congress could have required standards to be no
less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the worst performing member of the best performing
12 percent,'' or ``the emission limitation (averaged over time to take account of variability in the effectiveness
of control) achieved by all sources within the best performing 12 percent.'' Any of such phrases would have been a more
natural way to convey the Lower Floor Interpretation than the language Congress chose. However, the actual language
of section 112(d)(3)(A) provides, in straightforward fashion, that standards may be no less stringent than the ``average
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent *&blank;*&blank;*''. To glean the Lower Floor Interpretation
from this language is a strain; words and concepts not set forth in the statute must be added or inferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of section 112(d)(3)(B) makes this point even clearer. That section requires that standards for existing
sources in categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources be no less stringent than

42 U.S.C. 7412(d)(3)(B). If an interpretation parallel to the Lower Floor Interpretation were intended, it would
have been more natural for this provision to read ``the emission limitation achieved by the 5th best performing source.''

2. The Legislative History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history lends strong support to the view that, in passing section 112(d)(3)(A), Congress intended
the Higher Floor Interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the House side, the language that would eventually become section 112(d)(3)(A) was offered as a compromise amendment
by Rep. Dingell on the House Floor on May 23, 1990. (The language of the amendment was identical to section 112(d)(3)(A)
as ultimately enacted into law; only the numbers were different). Rep. Dingell yielded time to Rep. Collins ``for
purposes of explaining the amendment.'' Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 2896. In doing so, Rep. Collins
noted that she had originally supported slightly more stringent numbers than those included in the amendment, and
that under her original proposal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The average of emissions from the 10 percent cleanest sources would be the MACT standard. In cases where there are less
than 30 sources in a category or subcategory, the average of the 3 cleanest sources would determine the standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. She went on to explain that under the compromise amendment introduced by Rep. Dingell
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
MACT for existing stationary sources would be the average of the best 15 [percent] of technologies within each category
or subcategory. For categories or subcategories where there are less than 30 sources, the standard is based on the
average emissions from the best performing 5 sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 2897. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rep. Collins' formulations are consistent with the Higher Floor Interpretation, not the Lower. The ``average of
the 3 cleanest sources'' cannot mean, as the Lower Floor Interpretation would require, the level of control achieved
by all three of the ``cleanest sources.'' Nor can the ``average of the best 15 [percent] of technologies'' mean a technology
as good as that used by all sources within the top 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another discussion of section 112(d)(3) is similar. On October 27, 1990, Sen. Durenberger (a principal supporter
of the Clean Air Act Amendments) explained the provision on the Senate floor. His explanation was as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard may not be less stringent than the average of the emission levels achieved by the best performing 12 percent
of the existing sources within the category*&blank;*&blank;* The Administrator is to exclude from the calculation
of the average of top 12 percent any source which met the following conditions*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 870 (Cong. Rec. S16929_Oct. 27, 1990). The second sentence of Sen. Durenberger's
statement, in particular, is inconsistent with the Lower Floor Interpretation. Sen. Durenberger makes clear that
the ``average'' called for in the statute is of the ``top 12 percent,'' not the emission limitations achieved over
time at each individual source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No legislative history was found that supports the Lower Floor Interpretation. The EPA believes that the legislative
history indicates that individual legislators_including those central to the drafting of section 112(d)(3)_understood
the word ``average'' to mean that once the emission limitations achieved by the best performers in a category had been
determined, those results should be averaged. This is the method of the Higher Floor Interpretation, not the Lower.

(i) Plain Meaning of the Statute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the meaning of the statute was plain on its face and that Congress clearly intended
the Higher Floor Interpretation. These commenters argued that when section 112(d)(3)(A) is read as a whole in its
most natural way, the Congressional intent in favor of the Higher Floor Interpretation is clear. They argued that
if Congress had intended the Lower Floor Interpretation, it would have used different language in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA agrees with these comments. As set forth in greater detail above, EPA believes the plain statutory language
strongly favors the Higher Floor Interpretation.

Congress' Failure to Use the Words ``of the''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that if Congress had meant the Higher Floor Interpretation, it would have added the words
``of the'' to the statute, so that section 112(d)(3)(A) would read ``the average 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
of the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent.'' These commenters saw the absence of the words
``of the'' in the statute as evidence that Congress intended the Lower Floor Interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA agrees that the statute would be more clear if Congress had used the words ``of the,'' but disagrees with the
conclusion drawn by these commenters for two reasons. First, standard English usage often permits dropping the prepositions
``of the'' without changing the meaning of a phrase. (For example, ``the biggest mountain in North America'' has the
same meaning as ``the biggest of the mountains in North America.'' ``Best singer in the band'' has the same meaning
as ``best of the singers in the band.'') The same cannot be said, however, for the various phrases and concepts that
must be read into section 112(d)(3)(A) in order to arrive at the Lower Floor Interpretation. Phrases like ``the worst
performing member of...'' or ``averaged over time...'' simply are not dropped as part of standard English. Their
absence from section 112(d)(3)(A)_unlike the absence of the words ``of the''_must be considered significant in
interpreting the provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, although the words ``of the'' do not appear in section 112(d)(3)(A), they were used by key legislators in summarizing
that section prior to passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. As noted above, when Sen. Durenberger (a principal
supporter of the Clean Air Act Amendments) spoke on the Senate floor on October 27, 1990, he explained section 112(d)(3)(A)
as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 870 (Cong. Rec. S16929_Oct. 27, 1990) (emphasis added). As also noted
above, when Rep. Collins introduced the provision in the House, she described it as follows:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The average of emissions from the 10 percent cleanest sources would be the MACT standard. In cases where there are less
than 30 sources in a category or subcategory, the average 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
of the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 3 cleanest sources would determine the standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In EPA's view, the fact that Congress did not use the words ``of the'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) is fully consistent with
standard English. However, the fact that key legislators did use these words in describing the provision to their
colleagues, in combination with the failure of those legislators to use the phrases on which the Lower Floor Interpretation
depends, provides a strong indication that Congress intended the Higher Floor Interpretation in enacting section
112(d)(3)(A).

(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of the Word ``Average''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) should be read to require averaging
not of emissions from different sources within the top 12 percent, but instead of emissions from individual sources
at different times, or from different emission points, or made up of different HAP. The EPA does not agree that the word
``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) can reasonably be read to serve this purpose. First, such a reading is difficult,
if not impossible, to reconcile with the provision of section 112(d)(3) establishing a ``floor'' for new sources.
Under those provisions, new source standards may not be less stringent than
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
42 U.S.C. 7412(d)(3). Notably, Congress did not use the word ``average'' in this provision. If the word ``average''
in section 112(d)(3)(A) was intended to refer to averages across time, or between emission points, or among different
HAP, then Congress must have intended that such averaging would take place for existing source standards, but not
for new source standards. There is no reason to believe Congress intended this implausible result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a much more likely explanation: That to the extent Congress contemplated that averaging across time, or between
emission points, or among HAP would play a role in either existing or new source MACT standards, it considered the terms
``emission limitation'' and ``emission control'' fully adequate to reflect that fact. In EPA's air program, emission
limitations have routinely been expressed in terms of averages across time, for example, without any special statutory
direction or authority. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have thought that special instructions
were needed to ensure that EPA continued this practice, and even less reason to believe Congress would have thought
special instructions were needed with respect to existing source standards, but not new source standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the legislative history of section 112 casts doubt on the interpretation of the word ``average'' offered
by these commenters. When Congress comprehensively revised section 112 in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, it
based the revisions in substantial part on the Clean Water Act's effluent guidelines program. (See, e.g., Remarks
of Sen. Durenberger, Cong. Rec. S516 (January 30, 1990) (``*&blank;*&blank;* this approach to regulation of toxic
air pollutants is not without precedent. A program very similar to the one I have just described has already been implemented
under the Clean Water Act'').) Under that program, certain limits (known as ``BPT limits'') have long been based on
the ``average of the best'' performance at existing facilities. (See generally Remarks of Sen. Muskie, Legislative
History of Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 at 169&hyph;70 (``The Administrator should establish the
range of `best practicable' levels based upon the average of the best existing performance by plants of various sizes,
ages and unit processes.'')) In determining ``average of the best'' under the Clean Water Act, EPA has historically
identified the best performers in an industrial category, and then averaged their performances. This methodology
is consistent with the Higher Floor Interpretation and not the Lower.

(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proximity of the Word ``Average'' to the Words ``Emission Limitation''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the proximity of the word ``average'' to the words ``emission limitation'' suggests
that ``average'' modifies ``emission limitation,'' and not the entire phrase following those words. The EPA does
not agree with this argument. In English, adjectives often modify not only the noun immediately following, but an
entire phrase. In the phrase ``the biggest mountain in North America climbed by members of the Washington, D.C. Climbing
Club,'' for example, the adjective ``biggest'' modifies the entire remainder of the phrase. There is no reason to
conclude that the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) plays a different role.

Several commenters argued that the use of the words ``achieved by'' in the statute indicates that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources within the top 12 percent must be achieving the emission limitations used to set the MACT Floor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA does not agree with this argument. The EPA believes the argument depends both on inferring the presence of the
word ``all'' in section 112(d)(3)(A), and (as discussed above) on ignoring, or incorrectly construing, the meaning
of the word ``average.'' Section 112(d)(3)(A) simply does not say ``the emission limitation achieved by all sources
within the best performing 12 percent*&blank;*&blank;*''. Congress' use of the words ``achieved by'' cannot reasonably
be stretched to accomplish such a rewriting of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Arguments Concerning Structure of the Statute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that elements of the statute's structure support the Lower Floor Interpretation. For
example, some commenters argued that the Lower Floor Interpretation best reflects EPA's authority to consider cost
and other factors in setting standards more stringent than MACT Floor. Other commenters argued that the Lower Floor
Interpretation best reflects the distinction between existing source MACT and new source MACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not agree with these arguments. In fact, the Higher Floor Interpretation fully preserves both of these
structural elements of the statute. With the Higher Floor Interpretation, just as with the Lower, EPA still has authority
to establish existing source standards more stringent than the Floor based on enumerated criteria. With the Higher
Floor Interpretation, just as with the Lower, there is still a distinction between the Floor for existing sources
and the level of control required for new sources. (Under section 112(d)(3), standards for new sources must be at least
as stringent as ``the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source''). The
fact that there may be ``less distance'' to travel above the Floor with the Higher Floor Interpretation does not establish
an inconsistency between that interpretation and other parts of the statute, nor does it mean that the interpretation
is flawed in any way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, structural arguments tend to favor the Higher Floor Interpretation more strongly than the Lower. Section
112 was passed in its current form to ensure quick and dramatic reductions in air toxics emissions. Congress was frustrated
with the slow pace of toxics control prior to 1990, and many members in part blamed EPA for weak controls. See, e.g.,
H. Comm. Rep. 101&hyph;490 at 150&hyph;54, 322&hyph;23; S. Rpt. 101&hyph;228 at 128&hyph;33. The structure and
purpose of section 112 as a whole indicates that section 112(d)(3)(A) was intended to establish a stringent minimum
level of control for hazardous air pollutants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional Arguments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the Higher Floor Interpretation would require EPA to set MACT Floors that failed to
correspond to real-world control technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not agree with this argument. The EPA believes that the argument depends upon a flawed premise: That the
word ``average'' can only mean ``arithmetic mean.'' In fact, there are a number of conventional methods for determining
the average of a data set, including the median. Congress did not mandate a particular method of determining ``average''
or central tendency in section 112(d)(3)(A), and the choice of methodology_whether median, mean, or some other measure_can
often change the results markedly. For example, if the five facilities that make up the top 12 percent of a source category
are achieving reductions equal to 99 percent, 98 percent, 95 percent, 94 percent and 93 percent, EPA need not set the
MACT Floor equal to the arithmetic mean of these values, which is 95.8 percent. Using the Higher Floor Interpretation,
EPA could set the MACT Floor equal the median of these values, which is 95 percent.

C. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that Congress spoke with clarity in section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act. That provision_requiring
standards to be no less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources''_lends
little support for an interpretation under which standards might be set at the emission limitation achieved by the
worst performing member of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources. The legislative history offers no
support for such an interpretation, and indeed points strongly in the opposite direction. The EPA believes that the
Higher Floor Interpretation represents the best reading of the statutory language.

II. Discretion in Setting Floors for MACT Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's notice, EPA announces its conclusion that Congress intended the Higher Floor Interpretation. The effect
of this decision, however, is not to identify any particular number (e.g. the 94th percentile) as the Floor for all
MACT standards. EPA retains discretion in important respects in setting Floors for MACT standards, and intends to
exercise its discretion, within the statutory framework, to promulgate MACT standards that best serve the public
interest.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes the Agency retains substantial discretion, within the statutory framework, to set MACT Floors at appropriate
levels. For example, because Congress did not define the term ``average'' in section 112(d)(3), or in the legislative
history, it implicitly delegated the authority to EPA to do so. The choice of methodology_whether mean, median, mode,
or some other measure_can often change the results. (The mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements
divided by the number of measurements in the set. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which
there are an equal number of values, when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude. The mode is the value
that occurs most often in a set of measurements). As some commenters noted, the ``average of the best performing 12%''
corresponds to the 94th percentile when the word ``average'' is construed to be the ``median.'' If, however, ``average''
is construed to be the ``arithmetic mean'' or ``mode,'' a different result may obtain. EPA construes the word ``average''
in section 112(d)(3) to authorize the Agency to use any reasonable method, in a particular factual context, of determining
the central tendency of a data set. In addition, EPA has discretion to use its best engineering judgment in collecting
and analyzing the data, and in assessing the data's comprehensiveness, accuracy and variability, in order to determine
which sources achieve the best emission reductions. EPA also has discretion in determining how to analyze the data,
and thus in determining the appropriate ``average'' in each category or subcategory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other important ways that EPA retains discretion in setting MACT floors. For example, Congress authorized
EPA to subcategorize source categories based on classes, types and sizes of sources, which will result in different
Floors for different subcategories. CAA section 112(d)(1). Using this authority, EPA can tailor standards to certain
characteristics of particular emission units and sources. EPA retains flexibility, for example, to conclude that
the production processes used at particular sources in the relevant category are sufficiently different from processes
used at other sources in the same category to justify the creation of a new subcategory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These examples are not meant to be exhaustive. EPA has only begun the process of setting MACT standards. As EPA gains
experience in setting MACT Floors, other issues may arise that will require EPA to exercise its discretion in determining,
for each case, what represents the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12% of existing sources
(or the best performing five sources, in categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its March 9, 1994 document, EPA stated that ``the MACT floor decision *&blank;*&blank;* in this rulemaking will
have broad precedential effect, and will be presumptively followed in subsequent MACT rulemakings.'' 59 FR 11018.
Several commenters objected this statement, arguing that the issue of how best to interpret section 112(d)(3)(A)
should have been addressed in a separate, generally applicable rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA wishes to emphasize that, although today's decision concerning the interpretation of Clean Air Act section
112(d)(3) for purposes of the HON will be precedential for future rulemakings, it will not be binding. Specifically,
EPA will fully consider all comments on individual MACT standards, including those regarding the proper interpretation
of the language in sec. 112(d)(3)(A), received on or before the close of the comment periods for those standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reopening the comment period, EPA requested comment on whether the control requirements for medium storage vessels
previously proposed by EPA would be appropriate in the event those proposed controls were to be determined to be more
stringent than the floor. Only four commenters addressed the question of the appropriate controls requirement for
medium storage vessels and provided rationale for their opinions. Of these commenters, only one submitted information
which purported to represent control information for SOCMI storage vessels. This information was reviewed and found
to not provide any information on control performance and to represent storage vessels associated with non-SOCMI
processes (i.e., other source categories) as well as SOCMI processes. Therefore, the submitted information could
not be used to revise the database. The EPA review of this information is contained in item VI&hyph;B&hyph;62 in docket
A&hyph;90&hyph;19. This section of the preamble, therefore, only presents the basis for the final decision on control
requirements for medium sized storage vessels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For medium vessels, about 8 percent of the vessels are controlled with either a 90-percent efficient control device
or an IFR or EFR with a continuous seal. All of the controlled medium-sized vessels contained liquids with vapor pressures
of 13.1 kPa (1.9 psia). Because the arithmetic mean characteristics of the top 12 percent of the medium vessels would
not represent the performance of any known technology, the EPA used the median as the average for these vessels. Thus,
for medium-sized storage vessels, the floor determined by the average characteristics of the top 12 percent of the
sources would require control of vessels storing liquids with vapor pressures of 13.1 kPa (1.9 psia) by either a 90-percent
efficient control device or an IFR or EFR with a continuous seal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selection of the control provisions for medium-sized storage vessels, EPA considered the regulatory alternatives
that were presented in the April 22, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. These alternatives reflected a combination of: (1) The floor control for medium-sized storage vessels,
which at the time of proposal, were equipped with the floor controls and (2) the proposed control provisions for medium-sized
storage vessels which were equipped with no control or less efficient controls than the performance of the revised
floor component for the source-wide floor. The EPA did not develop a regulatory alternative corresponding to application
of the revised floor control level to all storage vessels. Such an alternative would have essentially the same control
costs as the proposed control provisions, but would result in a lower emission reduction. Because the floor control
would represent a less economically efficient option and would add to the complexity of the rule, this option was not
formally evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For medium storage vessels at existing sources, control at the regulatory alternative used to represent the floor
control was estimated to cost $2.4 million/yr and to result in an emission reduction of 370 Mg/yr (110 tons/yr). The
regulatory option for control level beyond the floor component is estimated to further reduce emissions by less than
100 Mg/yr (110 tons/yr) at an additional cost of $4 million/yr, or $48,000/Mg for each additional Mg of emission reduction.
Due to the relatively high incremental costs and low emission reductions of this alternative, the EPA believes that
the control level for the medium storage vessels component of the source-wide floor represented the maximum reduction
achievable considering cost and other impacts.

The reporting and recordkeeping burden of the information collection requirements of the provisions for medium
sized storage vessels are included in the estimate of the overall reporting burden, which is presented in ICR No. 1414.02.
The information collection requirements for the entire rule has an estimated annual reporting burden averaging
1,400 hours per response, and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 5,400 hours per respondent. These
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final action regarding provisions applicable to medium sized storage vessels in facilities subject to the HON
has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the Order, the Administrator has assessed
the potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action. The methods for and results of these cost and benefit analyses
are described in the HON's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). The RIA was included in the HON docket at proposal, and
thus it was made available for public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 also requires that the record for ``significant'' rules include an assessment of the potentially
effective and reasonably feasible alternatives to the planned action. The potentially effective and reasonably
feasible alternatives to the control requirements in the HON were also analyzed as part of the rule development process.
The methods for and results of these analyses are described in the HON's Background Information Document (BID). The
BID was included in the HON docket at proposal, and thus it was also available for public comment. In addition, many
of the alternative requirements considered by the Administrator were described in the preamble for the HON proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with selection of the final provisions are primarily the result of statutory requirements.
All elements of the cost that are not directly attributable to statutory requirements were deemed appropriate because
the Administrator determined that they were necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of this rule, the Administrator
has determined that the benefits justify the costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local and
tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of Federal regulations on small business entities. If a preliminary
analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory impacts are considered significant if any of the following criteria are met: (1) Compliance increases
annual production costs by more than 5 percent, assuming costs are passed on to consumers; (2) compliance costs as
a percentage of sales for small entities are at least 10 percent more than compliance costs as a percentage of sales
for large entities; (3) capital costs of compliance represent a ``significant'' portion of capital available to
small entities, considering internal cash flow plus external financial capabilities; or (4) regulatory requirements
are likely to result in closures of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs of the requirements for medium sized storage vessels were considered as part of the economic impact
analysis for the entire regulation. The assessment of the economic impacts of the overall regulation were presented
in the April 22, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 19449). Therefore, the addition of the final provisions to the standard does not alter the conclusion that the
standard is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this attached rule will not have an economic impact
on small entities because no additional costs will be incurred.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Kansas has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank (UST) program under subtitle I of
the Resource Conservation and Recover Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Kansas'
application and has reached a final determination that Kansas' underground storage tank program satisfies all of
the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Thus, EPA is granting final approval to the State of Kansas
to operate its program.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state UST programs to operate
in the state in lieu of the Federal UST program. To qualify for final authorization, a state's program must: (1) Be ``no
less stringent'' than the Federal program in leak detection, maintaining records, release reporting, corrective
action, tank closure, financial responsibility, new tank standards and the notification requirements of section
9004(a)(8) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2) provide for adequate enforcement (Section 9004(a) of RCRA, 42
U.S.C. 6991c(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 1, 1994, Kansas submitted an application for ``complete'' program approval which includes regulation
of both petroleum and hazardous substance tanks. Kansas also regulates heating oil tanks with the exception of tanks
used to store heating oil for consumptive use at a single family residence. However, this part of the Kansas program
is broader in scope than the Federal program and is not included in this final approval. On March 2, 1994, EPA published
a tentative decision announcing its intent to grant Kansas final approval. Further background on the tentative decision
to grant approval appears at 59 FR 9950, March 2, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of the application for public comment. Also, EPA provided notice that a public hearing would be provided
only if significant public interest on substantive issues was shown. EPA received no comments on the application
and no request for a public hearing, therefore, a public hearing was not held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that the State of Kansas' application for final approval meets all the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by subtitle I of RCRA. Accordingly, Kansas is granted final approval to operate its UST program. The State
of Kansas now has the responsibility for managing all regulated UST facilities within its borders and carrying out
all aspects of the UST program except with regard to Indian lands, where EPA will retain and otherwise exercise regulatory
authority. Kansas also has primary enforcement responsibility, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under section 9005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d, and to take enforcement actions under section 9006 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991e.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of Kansas' program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators
of underground storage tanks in the state. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 EPA is withdrawing a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance generically described as an aromatic amino ether which was the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;90&hyph;1840. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct final rulemaking procedures.
EPA received critical comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is withdrawing this rule, as required under the
Expedited SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed rulemaking published
elsewhere in today's issue of the

 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51684), EPA issued several direct final SNURs including a SNUR for the substance described
generically as aromatic amino ether, PMN P&hyph;90&hyph;1840. As described in 40 CFR 721.160, EPA is withdrawing
the rule issued for P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 under direct final rulemaking procedures because the Agency received adverse
comments. As required by &sect;721.160(a)(3)(iii), EPA is proposing the rule published elsewhere in today's issue

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is modifying a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for a fluorene substituted aromatic amine based on a modification to the TSCA section 5(e) consent order
regulating that chemical substance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 23, 1992 (57 FR 44050), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for fluorene substituted
aromatic amine (P&hyph;91&hyph;43). Because of the modification to the consent order for this substance, EPA is
modifying this SNUR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency proposed the modification of the SNUR for this substance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40397). The background and reasons for the modification of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble
to the proposed modification. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed modification. As a result
EPA is modifying this SNUR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Rationale for Modification of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this modification, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the substance, and EPA identified the tests considered
necessary to evaluate the potential risks of the chemical substance. Specifically, EPA concluded that dermal and
respiratory protection, hazard communication requirements, limiting uses to industrial uses only, a production
volume limit, and a prohibition against releases to surface waters were necessary to control the potential unreasonable
risks of the substance. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter
and a SNUR was promulgated. In light of data received for an analogous substance which indicates that the PMN substance
is not expected to cause retinopathy, the submitter petitioned, and EPA determined, that the requirement that labels
and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) indicate that the PMN substance may cause blindness and that eye protection
should be worn when handling the substance was no longer appropriate and hence, was unnecessary to protect human health.
The section 5(e) order modification eliminated that labeling and MSDS requirement based on the finding of no retinopathy
effects. The modification of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is consistent with the modification
of the section 5(e) order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Rulemaking Record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record for the rule which EPA is modifying was established at OPPTS&hyph;50601. This record includes information
considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the modification to the consent order to which the Agency
has responded with this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected by this rule would
likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance. Therefore, EPA believes
that the number of small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters
were small firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and have been assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for this substance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 7, 1993 (58 FR 27255). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble to
the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result EPA
is revoking this SNUR.

II. Objectives and Rationale of Revocation of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and that the substance is expected to be produced in substantial
quantities and there may be significant or substantial environmental exposure. EPA identified the tests necessary
to evaluate the risks of the substance. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the
PMN submitter, and a SNUR was promulgated. The consent order required the PMN submitter to perform toxicity testing
on the chemical substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the consent order for the substance and determined
that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance.
EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently
revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is
consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. EPA will no longer require notice
of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under
section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required.

III. Rulemaking Record

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record for the rule which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS&hyph;50585 (P&hyph;89&hyph;1062). This record
includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the test data to which the Agency

IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for adipic acid, polymer with 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol,
dipropylene glycol, alkanepolyol, substituted alkanolamines, and carbomonocyclic dicarboxylic acid (P&hyph;89&hyph;653).
Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is revoking this SNUR.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Parts 1720, 2070, 2510, and subpart 8352 of title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations are being removed in this administrative
final rule. In some instances, the statutory authorities prompting a part either have been repealed or have expired.
In other cases, the provisions of a part have been superseded by other regulations or replaced by BLM Manual provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 1720, which is being removed by this rule, lists policies pertaining to the disposal and management of the public
lands as managed by BLM before the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C.
1700 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These pre-FLPMA policies were based, to a considerable extent, on the Classification and Multiple Use Act, which
expired according to its own terms on December 23, 1970. The BLM's post-FLPMA management and disposal policies now
are reflected not only in FLPMA, but also in BLM's land use planning regulations, along with its other management-
or disposal-related regulations, and its manualized instructions to BLM personnel. The BLM's Manual is open to public
inspection. See 43 CFR 2.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 2510 pertains to the homestead laws that were repealed on October 21, 1976 (as to Alaska, October 21, 1986), by
FLPMA. Because homestead entries no longer can be made with regard to the public lands of the United States, the regulations
in this part are no longer needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 2070 and subpart 8352 were used to designate areas and sites. The types of designations referred to in these provisions
have all been superseded by designations created in FLPMA and other laws. Such designations include areas of critical
environmental concern, covered in 43 CFR part 1600; national conservation areas and national recreation areas,
covered in various specific resource management regulations; wilderness, covered in part 8560; and national trails
and rivers, covered in part 8350.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this final rule is an administrative action to remove obsolete provisions, it has been determined that it
has no impacts on the public. The Department of the Interior, therefore, for good cause finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)
and 553(d)(3) that notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary and that this rule may take effect upon publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal author of this final rule is Jim Paugh of the BLM Wyoming State Office, assisted by the staff of the Division
of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this final rule is a purely administrative regulatory action having no effects upon the public or the environment,
it has been determined that the rule is categorically excluded from review under section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.

As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a
taking of private property. No private property rights would be affected by a rule that merely removes obsolete regulations
no longer governing activities on the public lands. The Department therefore certifies that this proposed rule does
not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Removing obsolete
regulations that no longer govern activities on the public lands will have no economic effect whatsoever.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501

This order revokes an Executive Order insofar as it affects approximately 54.47 acres of National Forest System land
and 8.91 acres of public land withdrawn for use by the Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, for the Woronkofski
Point Lighthouse. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. This action will also open
the land within the Forest to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of National Forest System land. The land
has been and will continue to be subject to the Tongass National Forest reservation. Upon revocation, the public land
will be subject to the terms and conditions of Public Land Order No. 5180, as amended, and any other withdrawal of record.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery are found at
50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the
coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated
to each state are described in &sect;625.20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year set equal to 16,005,560 lb (7.3 million kg) and
the allocations to each state were published March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10586). NMFS issued a notification that the commercial
quota available to the State of Delaware for 1994 had been harvested, effective March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15863, April 5,
1994). The 1994 quotas for several states were adjusted for overages occurring in 1993, as required under &sect;625.20(d)(2),
on May 25, 1994. The quotas after adjustments for overages in 1993 for the states affected by this action were: Delaware,
^1,359 lb (^616 kg); Maryland, 324,117 lb (147,018 kg); North Carolina, 4,369,775 lb (1,982,117 kg); and Virginia,
3,242,354 lb (1,470,722 kg). Since Connecticut's quota was not exceeded in 1993, its 1994 quota of 361,258 lb (163,866
kg) did not need adjustment for overages prior to this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP was published December 17, 1993 (58 FR 65936), and allows two or more
states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director),
to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required to consider the criteria
set forth in &sect;625.20(f)(1) in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 625.20(3) further states that a state may not submit a request to transfer or combine quota if a request to which
it is party is pending before the Regional Director. While Delaware is the recipient of the four transfers, each request
to transfer quota was presented separately by each state, and therefore considered individually by the Regional
Director. Publication as one notification is efficient and convenient for reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia have agreed to transfer 96 lb (44 kg), 1,000 lb (454 kg), 2,782
lb (1,262 kg), and 2,162 lb (981 kg), respectively, of their commercial quotas to Delaware. The Regional Director
has determined that the criteria set forth in &sect;625.20(f) have been met, and publishes this notification of quota
transfers. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1994 are: Connecticut, 361,162 lb (163,822 kg); Delaware, 4,681
lb (2,123 kg); Maryland, 323,117 lb (146,565 kg); North Carolina, 4,366,993 lb (1,980,855 kg) and Virginia, 3,240,192
lb (1,469,742 kg). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because current landings estimates indicate that the Delaware inshore fishery has harvested the quota made available
through these transfers, no quota is currently available for landings in that State. Federally permitted vessels
may not land summer flounder in the State of Delaware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action does not alter any of the conclusions reached in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for Amendment
2 to the FMP regarding the effects of summer flounder fishing activity on the human environment. Amendment 2 established
procedures for setting an annual coastwide commercial quota for summer flounder and a formula for determining commercial
quotas for each state. The quota transfer provision was established by Amendment 5 to the FMP and the environmental
assessment prepared for Amendment 5 found that the action had no significant impact on the environment. Under &sect;6.02b.3(b)(i)(aa)
of NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6, this action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare
additional environmental analyses. This is a routine administrative action that reallocates commercial quotas
within the scope of previously published environmental analyses.

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 61 is 5,037 metric tons (mt), as established by the
1994 final specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) and modified in accordance with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 61 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 4,400 mt, and has set aside the remaining 637 mt as bycatch to support other
anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61 is prohibited, effective from 12
noon, A.l.t., June 2, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., July 1, 1994.

 NMFS is prohibiting retention of sablefish by persons using trawl gear in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. NMFS is requiring that catches of sablefish by these persons in the
BS be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary
because the share of the sablefish total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to trawl gear in the BS has been reached.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.24(c)(1)(i), the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to trawl gear in the BS was established
by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 230 metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.24(d)(2), that the share of the
sablefish TAC assigned to trawl gear in the BS has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches
of sablefish by persons using trawl gear in the BS be treated as prohibited species in accordance with &sect;675.20(c)(3),
effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

I. Statutory and Regulatory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987 (Title IV, Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, April 2, 1987) (1987 Amendments) amended
the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Principal among the 1987 Amendments is an expanded definition of the term ``displaced person'' to include any person
who has moved or moved his personal property ``as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition'' or privately undertaken
acquisition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised definition, an ``unlawful occupant'' or a person occupying a displacement dwelling ``for the purpose
of obtaining assistance,'' or a short-term renter who begins occupancy of the property with knowledge of its acquisition
for a project that involves displacement, is not a ``displaced person.'' (Section 402, 1987 Amendments.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 402(e) of the 1987 Amendments, the term ``comparable replacement dwelling'' is defined, in part, as a dwelling
that is adequate, decent, safe, and sanitary, functionally equivalent and generally in as desirable a location as
the location of the displaced person's dwelling. Also added by section 402(e) is a definition of the term ``displacing
agency'', which means ``any Federal agency carrying out a program or project, and any State, State agency, or person
carrying out a program or project with Federal financial assistance, which causes a person to be a displaced person.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405 of the 1987 Amendments added a new paragraph 4 to section 202(a) of the URA to provide a maximum reestablishment
payment of $10,000 for a displaced farm, nonprofit organization, or small business. Section 202(c) of the URA also
was amended to change the range of the fixed payment that is available as an alternative to a payment for actual reasonable
moving and related expenses. The new fixed payment ranges from $1,000 to $20,000. The former payment ranged from $2,500
to $10,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 406 of the 1987 Amendments amended section 203(a) of the URA to increase the maximum payment under section
203 from $15,000 to $22,500 with respect to replacement housing for a homeowner, and under section 204, amended by
section 407 of the 1987 Amendments, the maximum payment was increased to $5,250 for a renter. However, when such amounts
are not sufficient to provide a comparable replacement dwelling as required by section 205(c)(3), agencies must
provide additional or alternative assistance to the displaced person. Such additional or alternative assistance
is authorized under section 206 (amended by section 409 of the 1987 Amendments). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 412 of the Amendments authorized the lead agency (Department of Transportation (DOT)) to issue, with the
active participation of HUD and other Federal agencies, regulations to implement the URA. On March 2, 1989, DOT issued
a government-wide final rule (see 54 FR 8912) to follow an interim rule issued by that agency on December 17, 1987 (see
52 FR 47994). On February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4964), HUD published an interim rule advising that it would make effective
as of April 2, 1989 ``all the rule changes necessary to implement amendments'' to the URA. (Section 418 of the 1987 Amendments
mandated that the amendments take effect no later than April 2, 1989.)

II. Public Comment on Interim HUD Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received only one comment in response to the interim rule. The comment concerned the fact that HUD did not join with
DOT and certain other Federal agencies in the December 17, 1987 DOT interim final rule that implemented several of
the 1987 Amendments. The commenter thought that HUD's delay would result in lower replacement housing payments for
displaced persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOT interim rule did not increase the amount of replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced
from a dwelling. The URA ``common rule'' jointly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 7000) by HUD and 16 other Federal agencies on February 27, 1986, set forth an open-ended ``make whole'' standard
as the basis for determining the amount of replacement housing assistance to be provided to displaced persons.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ``make whole'' approach, the displacing agency must provide assistance sufficient to enable the displaced
person to purchase or rent (for a 42-month period) a comparable replacement dwelling, irrespective of the payment
limits under section 203 (raised to $22,500 from $15,000) or section 204 (raised to $5,250 from $4,000) of the URA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the open-ended ``make whole'' approach to providing replacement housing assistance under the ``common rule''
and subsequent DOT interim and final rules, the sole impact of the DOT interim rule on the provision of replacement
housing assistance was the reduction of rental assistance payments by 12.5 percent (caused by reducing the period
of assistance from 48 to 42 months). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 407 of the 1987 Amendments requires that URA rental assistance payments to lower income persons ``take into
account such person's income.'' This change, implemented in the DOT final rule (but not in the DOT interim rule) substantially
increased the amount of replacement housing assistance to very low-income persons. During the period between implementation
of the DOT interim and final rule, URA replacement housing payments to tenants were higher under the now removed HUD
URA rule at 24 CFR part 42 than under the DOT interim rule.

III. Public Comment on Proposed Section 8 Project-Based Certificate Program Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 24, 1993, HUD published proposed relocation requirements (58 FR 11319) for the Section 8 Project-Based
Certificate Program (PBC). The requirements were published with a proposed rule to conform Section 8 tenant-based
rental certificate and rental voucher rules. The proposed PBC relocation policies were similar to those followed
in other HUD-assisted programs. Three comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first comment addressed the current PBC requirement that prohibits the displacement of any residential tenant
of a unit to be assisted under the PBC Program. On February 24, 1993, HUD proposed revising this policy to conform it
to the standard applicable to other HUD-assisted programs. That standard allows displacement, provided it is consistent
with the other goals and objectives of the program, and property owners take all reasonable steps to minimize it. One
commenter opposed this proposal, stating that the current regulation works well to prevent displacement and, in
extreme cases, can be waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD believes that the current PBC displacement prohibition eliminates many projects where the failure to carry out
timely rehabilitation leads to property deterioration that ultimately increases displacement_displacement
without assistance to those forced to relocate. Under the proposed rule, persons displaced by rehabilitation for
an assisted project would receive relocation assistance at URA levels, obtaining standard housing at a cost that
is usually lower than what they had been paying for substandard housing. Accordingly, HUD did not adopt the comment,
and the final rule reflects the ``minimize displacement'' standard that is followed in other HUD programs and described
in the proposed rule. Also, it is noted that a public housing agency or Indian housing authority (HA) could opt to provide
a unit selection preference for units where the rehabilitation will not result in the displacement of a family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment addressed PBC relocation policy regarding ``partially-assisted buildings.'' The term ``partially-assisted''
is used to describe a building in which some, but not all, of the units will be ``assisted'' with a project-based subsidy
upon completion of the rehabilitation. Under the current PBC policy, only the occupants of units to be assisted under
the section 8 HAP contract are protected by the URA. HUD proposed revising this policy to conform it to policy in other
HUD-assisted rehabilitation programs where the tenants in all rehabilitated units in the building are protected,
whether or not the units they occupy will receive a PBC subsidy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed the application of URA protections to occupants of non-assisted units in a partially-assisted
building. The commenter was concerned about the cost and indicated that the policy would subsidize discrimination
because families who don't want to live with assisted families would ``grab a pot of money and move.'' This observation
reflects a misunderstanding of the proposed rule. A tenant who is offered the opportunity to occupy the property upon
completion of the rehabilitation under reasonable terms and conditions is not entitled to relocation assistance
if he or she elects to relocate. Given the limited amount of rehabilitation (and relocation) that can be supported
with PBC subsidies, HUD does not anticipate significant displacement under the PBC program and, therefore, does
not expect significant relocation costs under the program. More importantly, those costs which do occur as a result
of a project should not be borne by the tenant. Accordingly, HUD did not adopt this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third commenter asked that &sect;882.712(g)(3), which allows an HA to request HUD's determination as to whether
a displacement is or would be covered by the regulations, should include a requirement for a 30-day response time by
HUD. HUD will endeavor to respond to all HA requests as quickly as practicable and certainly within 30 days after all
relevant information is received. A regulatory requirement for a 30-day HUD response time would not be meaningful,
however, because HUD's failure to respond within that period could not serve as a basis for the HA to conclude that the
person was not eligible for relocation assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule is similar to the proposed rule. As with other HUD-assisted programs, in-place tenants, who will not
be displaced from the building/complex, must be provided a written notice, which offers the opportunity to lease
a unit in the building/complex under reasonable terms and conditions after the rehabilitation has been completed.
As described in &sect;882.712(g)(1)(iii)(A), such reasonable terms and conditions include a post-rehabilitation
rent that does not exceed the greater of: (1) The rent charged prior to the agreement, or (2) an affordable rent based
on the tenant's income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such reasonable terms and conditions also include reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by an in-place tenant who is required to relocate temporarily or to move permanently to another unit in the building/complex
so the rehabilitation can be carried out. If these conditions are not met and the in-place tenant moves permanently
from the building/complex, the tenant will be considered to have been displaced by the project and to be entitled to
relocation assistance at URA levels.

IV. This Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is being issued to conform existing HUD program regulations to the DOT final rule at 49 CFR part 24. This rule
does not reissue the DOT rule, but, for the benefit of HUD program users, adds definitions or descriptions that are
peculiar to HUD's programs. Also, the rule does not change any of the environmental program requirements or the compliance
requirements of 24 CFR parts 50 and 58. Users are urged to consult the DOT final rule (49 CFR part 24) for a more detailed
description of, and guidance for, all matters relating to displacement covered by the URA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the interim rule published by this agency on February 19, 1988, and now adopted by this rule, parts 42
and 43 have been removed, except that &sect;42.1 (the only section in 24 CFR part 42) remains as a guide-post to readers.
It advises readers to consult the DOT rule at 49 CFR part 24 for the regulations implementing the URA and the 1987 Amendments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain terms, although treated in the DOT rule, are nonetheless defined, where appropriate, in the several parts
of this rule. See, for example, the definitions contained in this rule for the terms ``displaced person'' and ``initiation
of negotiations.'' (These terms are defined in the DOT rule at 49 CFR 24.2(g) and 49 CFR 24.2(k), respectively.) The
terms ``displaced person'' and ``initiation of negotiations'' are defined in this rule in order to cover circumstances
unique to HUD's programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some areas, HUD program regulations reflect policy determinations which go beyond the letter of the URA. The URA
and the regulations at 49 CFR part 24 do not directly create eligibility for relocation assistance (as a ``displaced
person'') for a tenant-occupant who is permitted to remain in the property but moves from the property because he or
she cannot afford the rent charged upon completion of a project (economic displacement); who is required to relocate
temporarily, but not permanently, while the project is underway; or who must move permanently to other space in the
building/complex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, to protect such tenant-occupants, these program regulations provide that a tenant who moves permanently
because the terms and conditions of continued occupancy, temporary relocation, or relocation within the building/complex
are unreasonable will qualify as a ``displaced person'' who is entitled to relocation assistance at levels identical
to those required in 49 CFR part 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining whether the economic displacement of a tenant has occurred, these regulations establish
as ``reasonable,'' a rent/utility charge that does not exceed the greater of: (1) A specified share of the person's
income (e.g., 30 percent of income), or (2) the tenant's old monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs.
A tenant who is required to pay a higher cost upon completion of the project may elect to remain in the project or move
permanently and obtain relocation assistance at URA levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the various program regulations made by this rule reflect basic HUD policy. The HUD URA rule at 24 CFR
part 42 (now superseded) contained similar policies, as do regulations covering other HUD-assisted programs (e.g.,
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program regulations at 24 CFR part 570).

Minimizing Displacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of statutory requirements (not superseded by the URA) governing some of HUD's programs, this rule provides,
where necessary, that grantees minimize displacement. See, e.g., 24 CFR 510.52(a). This standard HUD policy urges
grantees, consistent with the goals and objectives of the HUD program, to assure that they take reasonable steps to
minimize direct and indirect displacement as a result of a project. For example, if feasible, residential occupants
of buildings to be rehabilitated must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent,
safe, sanitary and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex following completion of the project. No comparable
provision is to be found in the DOT rule. That rule's purpose is to implement the URA.

At the time of publication of the interim rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was
made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without significant change. Accordingly,
the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between
7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule ensures that families that are affected by displacement activity
receive adequate assistance with respect to their relocation.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between
them and other levels of government. The rule's major effects are on individuals and businesses. States or their political
subdivisions are affected by this rule only to the extent that they act as grantees of Federal funds, disbursing these
funds to the ultimate recipients_businesses and individuals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
displaced person
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves
personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for a project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced person'' includes, but may not be limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after the Owner's execution
of the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition, if the move occurs before the tenant is
provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary
dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such
reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed
the amount approved by HUD; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex,
if either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary
relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and
incidental expenses; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after he or she has been required
to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the move; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Any person, including a person who moves before the Owner's execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation,
demolition, or acquisition, if the Owner or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from rehabilitation,
demolition or acquisition for the assisted project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required
to move to another dwelling unit in the building/complex, if either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the move; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy
agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the PHA determines that the
eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the preliminary proposal (or application, if there
is no preliminary proposal), and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the
project and its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer
a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for any assistance provided
under this section) as a result of the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for the project.

A ``displaced person'' (defined in paragraph (h) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels
described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.
A ``displaced person'' shall be advised of his/her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), and,
if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment
to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given,
if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located
in such areas.

Notices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) As soon as possible after the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the PHA shall issue a general
information notice (described in 49 CFR 24.203(a)) to each occupant of the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the time of the initiation of negotiations (defined in paragraph (i) of this section), the PHA shall issue an
appropriate written notice to each person occupying the property. Those to be displaced shall be issued a notice of
eligibility for relocation assistance. (This notice may be combined with the 90-day notice under 49 CFR 24.203(c).)
Tenants (eligible under 24 CFR 913.103 and the standards for tenancy established in accordance with 24 CFR 960.204)
who will not be displaced shall be issued a notice offering the tenant the opportunity to enter into a lease to continue
in occupancy of the property under reasonable terms and conditions. (Also, see paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.)

or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination
with the PHA. A person who is dissatisfied with the PHA's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request
for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The PHA shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that it will comply
with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and shall ensure such compliance
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the PHA to comply. The certification in the PHA's ``Resolution
in Support of Public Housing Project'' that the PHA will comply with all the requirements of 24 CFR part 941 shall constitute
the PHA's certification of compliance with the URA, the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost of required assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project
costs. Such costs may also be paid from funds available from other sources.

(1) For conventional or acquisition projects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where the PHA purchases the real property through an arm's-length transaction (as described in 49 CFR 24.101(a)(1)),
the seller's acceptance of the PHA's written offer to purchase the property (i.e., the seller's execution of form
HUD&hyph;51971&hyph;II), provided the PHA later purchases the property; or such other date, as may be determined
by the PHA with the approval of the HUD Field Office; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the PHA's purchase of the real property does not qualify as an arm's-length transaction under 49 CFR 24.101(a)(1),
the delivery of the initial written purchase offer from the PHA to the Owner of the property (i.e., the PHA executed
form HUD&hyph;51971&hyph;II). However, if the PHA issues a notice of intent to acquire the property, and a person
moves after that notice, but before the initial written purchase offer, the ``initiation of negotiations'' is the
actual move of the person from the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For turnkey projects, HUD Field Office approval of the PHA's proposal incorporating the developer's proposal,
provided the contract of sale is later executed; or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model ATR42&hyph;200
and &hyph;300 series airplanes. This proposal would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking
in certain hinge pins of the nose landing gear (NLG), and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. This proposal
is prompted by reports of cracking of certain hinge pins in the NLG. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;200 and -300
series airplanes. The DGAC advises that cracking has been found on the hinge pins during routine overhaul of the nose
landing gear (NLG) on Model ATR42&hyph;200 and -300 series airplanes. The cause for this cracking has been attributed
to improper heat treatment during manufacture of the hinge pins. The defective pins have been isolated to those manufactured
by Nardi having part number D56867 and serial numbers beginning with the letter ``N.'' This condition, if not corrected,
could result in collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994, that
describes procedures for a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins of the NLG,
and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and
issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;005&hyph;055(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect
cracking in certain hinge pins in the NLG, and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,240, or $330 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to various smaller transport category airplanes certificated for operation with a main deck Class B cargo compartment.
That action would have required either the conversion of all main deck Class B cargo compartments to the Class C configuration;
or the use of flame penetration-resistant containers with smoke detection and fire extinguishing systems to carry
all cargo; or the accomplishment of certain operational and equipment changes and design modifications to maximize
cargo fire detection and control. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received
new data and is undertaking alternative rulemaking action. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to various smaller transport category airplanes certificated for operation with a main deck Class B cargo compartment,
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 5, 1990 (55 FR 36284). The proposed rule would have required either the conversion of all main deck Class
B cargo compartments to a Class C configuration; or the use of flame penetration-resistant containers with smoke
detection and fire extinguishing systems to carry all cargo; or the accomplishment of certain operational and equipment
changes and design modifications to maximize cargo fire detection and control. That action was prompted by a report
of an uncontained fire in a main deck cargo compartment on a transport category airplane. The proposed actions were
intended to prevent an uncontrolled cargo fire that could cause extensive damage to the systems and structure of the
airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received additional data and has initiated other rulemaking activity,
which has caused it to reconsider its previous position on this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received over 128 comments and suggestions to the proposal, including ones from affected operators, aircraft
manufacturers, industry representatives, and civil aviation authorities from around the world. The general nature
of almost all of the comments received was in disagreement with the issuance of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that further action on this AD be postponed until the proposed actions have been carefully
coordinated with the aviation authorities of the countries controlling the type certificates of the applicable
aircraft. The FAA notes that, during the development of this proposal, it apprised foreign civil airworthiness authorities
(FCAA) of the planned actions. The FAA has given due consideration to the comments and recommendations that were received
from each of these FCAA's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters question the justification for the proposed rule and request that it be withdrawn. Five commenters
question the FAA's method of requiring change via an AD. Several commenters consider that the proposed rule fails
to meet the regulatory requirements of &sect;39.1 (``Airworthiness Directives; Applicability'') of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.1); these commenters contend that the FAA has not established that the unsafe condition
is likely to exist or develop on the affected airplanes. One commenter points out that a review of the FAA's Service
Difficulty Reports (SDR) failed to disclose any problem with regard to detection, access to, or control of smoke or
fires in baggage compartments of airplanes of the type and size affected by the proposal. One of these commenters points
out that there is no service history to suggest that compartments of this size [under 400 cubic feet] have been or are
likely to be a fire hazard. Four commenters consider that the FAA's intent in proposing the AD should instead be addressed
either as a change to affected operators' Operation Specifications or as a change to part 121 (``Certification and
Operations: Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Air Carriers and commercial Operators of Large Aircraft'') of the
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 121).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with certain observations made by these commenters. The FAA has conducted a review the SDR's as well
as the United Kingdom Civil Airworthiness Authority's (CAA) World Airline Accident Summary and found no reports
of incidents or accidents caused by fire in the Class B cargo compartment of transport airplanes addressed by this
notice. The historical data that was reviewed indicates only that there has not been a cargo compartment fire in the
size of airplanes specified in the notice. However, the lack of incidents of fire does not establish that the Class
B compartment, as defined in the existing certification regulations, has appropriate safeguards if a fire were to
occur. It is this aspect that the proposed rule was meant to address.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters state that the smaller cargo compartments of the airplanes affected by this proposed AD are different
from the larger compartments on the airplanes that are affected by AD 93&hyph;07&hyph;15, amendment 39&hyph;8547
(58 FR 21243, April 20, 1993), since those compartments contain pallets and/or containers. One commenter states
that the smaller cargo compartments used in commuter service have not been established to be similar, from the standpoint
of safety, to main deck Class B compartments of larger transports; therefore, any action to address fire safety should
concentrate on large ``Combi'' cargo compartments, as in AD 93&hyph;07&hyph;15. Another commenter considers that
the fire detection problems that may exist on jumbo-jet airplanes do not have any relevance for smaller airplanes.
Another commenter states that the hazard of carrying large pallets/containers in increasingly large ``Combi''
compartments is the issue to be addressed, not the size of the compartment itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA disagrees that the smaller cargo compartments are not similar, with regard to fire safety, to the larger compartments
containing pallets or containers. On the smaller transport airplanes, cargo and luggage are loaded in a manner such
that smoke detection and access may be inhibited if the fire is deep-seated (buried in the cargo), much the same as in
a container or pallet on a larger transport airplane. Further, the FAA has observed, and one commenter to the notice
admitted, that in many instances, some operators of the smaller transport airplanes load the airplane's cargo compartments
in such a manner that there is no place to displace the cargo within the compartment in order to get at a fire. This presents
a two-fold hazard: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The fire cannot be accessed and continues to burn; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If cargo is removed from the cargo compartment, passengers could be exposed to fire, toxic smoke, and fumes; this
situation is unsafe and contrary to the concept and rule requirements of the Class B cargo compartment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters provide information concerning the economic effects of the proposed AD. One of these commenters,
an operator, states that it has had a long-term investment in its combi operations; however, if the rule is issued,
any further ``Combi'' operations would be cost-prohibitive for this operator. This would force the operator to raise
passenger ticket prices, and resort to less frequent all-passenger or all-cargo flights. Another commenter states
that the proposed requirements of the rule would have a devastating effect on service to remote communities that have
no alternative means of transport available. Another commenter states that it would cost up to $200,000 per airplane
to accomplish the requirement to convert the cargo compartment to a Class C configuration; this would be a great economic
burden for small operators. Another commenter estimated that the requirements of the proposed rule would cost 10%
of its annual gross revenues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments and other information provided, the FAA must continue to consider the following aspects
relevant to this rulemaking action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A service history indicating that there has not been a fire in the Class B cargo compartments of the size of aircraft
addressed by the proposed rule; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cargo loading practices on the smaller transport category airplanes that may inhibit smoke detection and negate
access requirements of the Class B cargo compartment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of fire in Class B cargo compartments and the impossibility
of eliminating the potential for such fires, the FAA cannot conclude that the existing Class B compartments do not
present an unsafe condition. However, this condition is a result of flaws in the underlying design standards for these
compartments, and correcting those flaws may have significant economic and operational consequences. For these
reasons, the FAA has concluded that issuance of an AD to address this condition is not warranted at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA now considers that a change to part 25 (``Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes'') of the
FAR (14 CFR part 25) and to the relevant operating regulations of the FAR to address these issues is more appropriate
and will allow further public participation in the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, just prior to the time that the notice was published, a subgroup of the Department of Transportation Task Force
on FAA Reform recommended that a Standing Advisory Committee for Rulemaking be established. The Secretary of Transportation
approved this recommendation, and the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was chartered in 1991. The
purpose of the committee is to provide advice and recommendations to the FAA concerning the full range of the FAA's
rulemaking activity with respect to safety-related issues. The expected benefits of ARAC are to take advantage of
the industry technical expertise and experience, to resolve controversies in an open forum, to resolve issues before
formal rulemaking, and to broaden public participation in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has asked ARAC to consider 70 rulemaking issues, one of which is rulemaking relative to the Class B cargo compartment.
A ``Class B Cargo Compartment Harmonization Working Group'' was established recently to formulate and harmonize
an international position on amended requirements for the Class B cargo compartment as installed on transport category
airplanes. In its deliberations, ARAC currently is considering the safety issues related to the Class B cargo compartment,
appropriate rule requirements, necessary rule changes, estimated costs, and comments and advice from the aviation
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this other on-going rulemaking activity, the FAA hereby withdraws the proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish a new and independent Class D airspace at Robins AFB, Georgia. Robins AFB has a full
time air traffic control tower. This notice further proposes to amend Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional
Airport, Macon, Georgia, by removing Robins AFB from the Macon, Georgia, Class D description. This notice also proposes
to establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, when the associated control tower
is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way communication with these air traffic control
towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when the Middle Georgia
Regional Airport control tower is closed.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish a new
independent Class D airspace at Robins AFB, Georgia. Additionally, the FAA is proposing to amend Class D airspace
and establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Prior to Airspace Reclassification
an Airport Traffic Area (ATA) and a control zone existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification,
effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zones,''
replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace''. Robins AFB was incorporated in the Class D airspace for
Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Robins AFB has a full time control tower. However, the Macon Radar
Approach Control/Tower, which controls aircraft for the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, is part-time. The intended
effect of this proposal is to amend the Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport by removing Robins AFB from
the Macon, Georgia Class D Airspace and designation. This notice also proposes to establish Class E surface airspace
at the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, to provide adequate controlled airspace for instrument
approach procedures when the Macon Radar Approach Control/Tower is closed.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations for Class D and Class E
airspace are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective
September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1993. The Class D and E airspace
designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine modifications are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On April 26, 1994, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 794 (59 FR 21698) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the notice, ATF proposed to amend trade practice regulations in 27 CFR parts 6 (Tied-House), 8 (Exclusive Outlet),
10 (Commercial Bribery) and 11 (Consignment Sales) by adding standards for enforcing the ``exclusion'' element
where appropriate and by revising other regulations as the result of an agency review and an industry petition. At
this time, no final decision has been made on whether to hold public hearings and ATF continues to reserve that decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to allow interested persons to comment fully, the comment period, originally scheduled to close on June 27,
1994, will be extended until July 27, 1994. All written comments received will be considered in the development of
a decision on this matter. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views or suggestions presented
will be particularly helpful in developing a reasoned regulatory decision on this matter.

<SUMMARY>

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing commercial,
civil, and military aerospace original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and rework facilities that are major sources
of HAP emissions. A major source is defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act) as a source
that emits, or has the potential to emit, considering controls, 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any individual HAP
or 25 tpy or more of any combination of HAP. The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Act, which requires
the Administrator to regulate emissions of the HAP listed in section 112(b) of the Act. Many of these pollutants are
emitted from cleaning, primer, topcoat, depainting, and chemical milling maskant operations. These operations
are being covered in the proposed rule. The intent of the proposed rule is to protect the public health by requiring
new and existing major sources to control HAP emissions to the level attainable by the maximum achievable control
technology (MACT). The EPA is also proposing Method 309 with the standards. Method 309 would be used to determine the
rolling material balance period for carbon adsorbers.

A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires, under section 112, that EPA evaluate and control emissions of HAP. The control of HAP is to be achieved
through promulgation of emission standards under sections 112(d) and (f) for categories of sources that emit HAP.
Pursuant to section 112(c) of the Act, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the initial list of source categories that emit HAP on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). This list includes major and area
sources of HAP that the EPA intends to regulate before November of the year 2000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of the proposed rule, aerospace industries refers to all facilities that manufacture aerospace
vehicles or components and all facilities that rework (including repair) these aerospace vehicles or components.
Aerospace vehicle or component is defined as any fabricated part, processed part, assembly of parts, or completed
unit of any aircraft including, but not limited to, airplanes, helicopters, missiles, rockets, and space vehicles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 183(b)(3) of the Act requires the Administrator to issue control techniques guidelines (CTG) for volatile
organic compound (VOC) emissions from aerospace coatings and solvents to such levels as the Administrator determines
are achievable through adoption of best available control measures (BACM). The EPA is required to take into account
the applicable requirements of section 112 in developing the guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organic HAP emissions limitations described in the remainder of this notice also address the VOC emissions from
aerospace coatings and solvents. Thus, the control techniques evaluated for the MACT standard are also applicable
to VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA traditionally issues a draft CTG containing recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than issue
a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA is using this notice to request public comment on a draft BACM, which is the
same as the proposed MACT for coatings and solvents. Comments received on the proposed MACT rule will also be considered
in formulating a final BACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information described here will also serve to provide guidance to the States for developing VOC rules to meet other
Clean Air Act requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain low-usage coatings were not addressed in the NESHAP. These coatings are adhesives, sealants, and 30 specialty
coatings which represent less than 6 percent of the total HAP emissions from the industry. Also, the EPA data analyses
indicate that the MACT floor for these coatings would be no control. The EPA is requesting public comment on the need
for a separate CTG providing guidance for the control of these coatings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would apply to each aerospace manufacturing and rework facility that is a major source, as defined
under section 112(a) of the Act. A major source is one that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls,
9.1 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tpy) or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more of any combination
of hazardous air pollutants for all activities conducted at the facility. An aerospace facility is defined as a facility
that produces in any amount an aerospace vehicle or component, or a facility that reworks (or repairs) these vehicles
or components. Aerospace operations at any major source that conduct both aerospace and non-aerospace work would
be subject to the proposed standards, regardless of the relative proportion of aerospace and non-aerospace work
at the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the proposed rule applies only to major sources, the EPA requests comment on whether all or some of its requirements
should be applied to non-major sources. The Agency solicits available information from state and local air pollution
control agencies and others on the nature, number and location of non-major aerospace facilities, the quantities
and types of hazardous air pollutants they emit, the impact of these emissions on health and the environment, and the
extent to which these emissions already are controlled. Comments also are requested on the economic and other impacts
that would result from applying requirements of the proposed rule to these smaller sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, aerospace facilities are covered by the SIC codes listed in Table 2. However, facilities classified under
other SIC codes may be subject to the proposed standards if the facility meets the definition of a major source and the
definition of an aerospace facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information obtained through the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce_Bureau
of the Census, there are an estimated 2,869 aerospace facilities that will be subject to the proposed standards. Of
this number, 1,395 manufacture or rework commercial products, and 1,474 manufacture or rework military products.
The combined HAP emissions from these facilities are estimated to be over 189,000 Mg/yr (208,000 tpy). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these facilities, there are numerous subcontractors that manufacture or rework aerospace vehicles
or components. The subcontractors may work directly for the

OEM or rework facilities, or indirectly through first line subcontractors. Since many of these subcontractors perform
various types of work, they are often classified under non-aerospace SIC codes. Consequently, an estimate of the
number of subcontractors cannot be made. One company alone, however, employs the services of over 5,000 subcontractors.

2. Affected Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would limit organic HAP emissions from the following sources at aerospace facilities: cleaning
operation, primer application operation, topcoat application operation, depainting operation, chemical milling
maskant application operation, and the handling and storage of waste. The proposed rule would also limit inorganic
HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and depainting operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations occur from the
evaporation of the solvent contained in the coatings. These emissions occur during the application of the coatings
on aerospace vehicles or parts, which may take place in large open areas, such as hangars, or in partially or fully enclosed
spaces, such as within spray booths. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions from cleaning and depainting operations occur from the evaporation of the volatile portion
of the cleaning solvents or chemical strippers. Cleaning emissions are nearly always fugitive in nature and occur
at essentially every processing step. Emissions from depainting are typically fugitive in nature since the operation
is carried out within a large hangar or in open tanks.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Organic HAP emissions from waste occur from evaporation of the volatile portion of the waste while it is being handled
or stored. These emissions are fugitive in nature, occurring from each waste container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations occur during the application of the primer
or topcoat. These inorganic HAP emissions are paint particulates, commonly referred to as ``overspray,'' that do
not adhere to the surface being coated. Like the organic HAP emissions from the operations, the emissions of the inorganic
HAP occur in large open areas, such as hangars, or in partially or fully enclosed spaces, such as within spray booths.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations occur from most non-chemical methods, such as plastic media
blasting, used to strip an aerospace vehicle. (Chemical stripping techniques do not release inorganic HAP.) These
emissions occur as particulates generated during the blasting process. The operation is typically carried out within
a large hangar equipped with a ventilation system and particulate filtration device (e.g., a baghouse). The inorganic
HAP that are released from the depainting operations are primarily found in the paint being stripped, although some
stripping media may contain trace amounts of inorganic HAP.

(1) All affected sources shall submit any request for an extension of compliance not later than 12 months before the
affected source's compliance date regardless of whether sources are included in emissions averaging or not, rather
than not later than 18 months before the affected source's compliance date for sources that are including emission
points in an emissions average as provided for in &sect;63.6(i)(4)(i)(B), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of
his/her intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance submitted under either &sect;63.6(i)(4)
or (i)(5) within 60 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate the request, rather than notifying
the owner of his/her approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar
days as provided for in &sect;63.6(i)(12)(i) and &sect;63.6(i)(13)(i). In addition, if the Administrator does
not notify the owner or operator in writing of his/her intention to deny approval within 60 calendar days after receipt
of sufficient information to evaluate a request for an extension of compliance, then the request shall be considered
approved, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application

a determination) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after
receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted, rather than 15 calendar days as provided for in &sect;63.6(i)(13)(i).
In addition, if the Administrator does not notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application
within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any

made, rather than 30 calendar days as provided for in &sect;63.6(i)(12)(iv) and &sect;63.6(i)(13)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule requires each owner or operator who uses a control device or equipment to control HAP
emissions to prepare an operation and maintenance plan in accordance with &sect;63.6 of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the information required in &sect;63.6, the proposed rule requires that the owner or operator of the
control device or equipment include the following information: (1) The operation and maintenance criteria for each
air pollution control device or equipment, including a standardized checklist to document the operation and maintenance
of the equipment; (2) a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions and for reporting them immediately to
supervisory personnel; and (3) procedures to be followed to ensure that equipment or process malfunctions due to
poor maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The general standards also state that an owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device or equipment not
listed in the proposed rule must submit to the Administrator for approval a description of the device, test data verifying
the performance of the device or equipment for HAP and/or VOC emissions, appropriate operating parameters that would
be monitored to establish compliance with the proposed standards, and a copy of the inspection and maintenance plan
required under &sect;63.6 of 40 CFR part 63. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;63.6(g) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63 allows an owner or operator of an affected source to use alternative
means of compliance. This allows the development and use of new technology not known or not demonstrated at the time
the rule was promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The affected sources for the proposed standards are defined as follows: (1) Each cleaning operation (all hand-wipe
cleaning operations constitute an affected source, each spray gun cleaning operation constitutes an affected source,
and all flush cleaning operations constitute an affected source); (2) each primer application operation, which
includes all primer applications at the facility; (3) each topcoat application operation, which includes all topcoat
applications at the facility; (4) each depainting operation, which includes all depainting of the outer surface
of aerospace vehicles at the facility; (5) each chemical milling maskant application operation, which includes
all chemical milling maskant applications at the facility for subsequent use in Type II chemical milling etchants;
and (6) each waste storage and handling operation, which includes all waste handling and storage at the facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards also specify that HAP-containing waste that is subject to the provisions of RCRA would not
be subject to the waste handling and storage requirements of the proposed standards. The EPA included this provision
so that the proposed standards would not require less strict handling and storage of waste than the RCRA requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following paragraphs summarize the proposed standards for each affected source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Cleaning Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for the cleaning operation, including those specific to hand-wipe, spray gun, and flush cleaning
operations, would apply to all new and existing affected sources. The proposed standards would require that all fresh
and spent cleaning solvents be stored in closed containers and that solvent-laden cloth, paper, or other material
be placed in bags or other closed containers immediately after use. The bags or containers would be required to be kept
closed at all times (except when depositing or removing material) and of such design so as to contain the vapors of the
cleaning solvent. In addition, the proposed standards would require the owner or operator to implement handling
and transfer procedures to minimize spills during filling and transferring the cleaning solvent to or from enclosed
systems, vats, waste containers, and other cleaning operation equipment that holds or stores fresh or spent cleaning
solvents. The above requirements are known collectively as housekeeping measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards for the hand-wipe cleaning operation would require the use of a cleaning solvent that conforms
to the approved composition list detailed in Table 3 or a cleaning solvent that has a vapor pressure less than or equal
to 45 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) at 20

bioenzyme mixtures and nutrients may be combined with the water along with a variety of additives such as organic solvents
(e.g., high boiling point alcohols), builders, saponifiers, inhibitors, emulsifiers, pH buffers, and antifoaming
agents.

The EPA is proposing a work practice standard for the cleaning of spray guns at all new and existing affected sources.
The proposed rule would require all spray guns to be cleaned by one or more of the following methods (or their equivalent):
(1) Use of an enclosed spray gun cleaning system that is kept closed when not in use, (2) nonatomized discharge of solvent
into a waste container that is kept closed when not in use, (3) disassembly of the spray gun and cleaning in a vat that
is kept closed when not in use, and (4) atomized spray into a waste container that is fitted with a device designed to
capture atomized solvent emissions. In addition, the EPA is proposing that leaks from enclosed spray gun cleaners
be repaired as soon as practicable but no later than 15 days from when the leak is first discovered. The EPA is also proposing
a work practice standard for the flush cleaning of parts, assemblies, and components of a coating unit. Under the proposed
rule, each time a part, assembly, or component of a coating unit (with the exception of spray guns) is flush cleaned,
the spent cleaning solvent would be emptied into an enclosed container or collection system that is kept closed when
not in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following cleaning operations, which would still be required to comply with the proposed housekeeping requirements,
would be exempt from the proposed cleaning solvent composition and vapor pressure requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Cleaning during the manufacture, assembly, installation, or testing of components of breathing oxygen systems
that are exposed to the breathing oxygen,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cleaning during the manufacture, assembly, installation, or testing of parts, subassemblies, or assemblies
that are exposed to strong oxidizers or reducers (e.g., nitrogen tetroxide, liquid oxygen, hydrazine),

2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for primer and topcoat application operations would be the same for all new and existing affected
sources. Standards are being proposed to limit organic and inorganic HAP emissions from these operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Organic HAP and VOC emissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The standards being proposed would limit the organic HAP emissions from primer application operations to an equivalent
organic HAP content level of 350 grams of organic HAP per liter (2.9 pounds per gallon (lb/gal)) of primer (less water)
as applied, and from topcoat application operations to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 420 grams of organic
HAP per liter (3.5 lb/gal) of topcoat (less water) as applied. In addition to the organic HAP limits, the proposed standards
would limit VOC emissions from primer application operations to an equivalent VOC content level of 350 grams of VOC
per liter (2.9 lb/gal) of primer (less water and exempt solvents) as applied, and from topcoat application operations
to an equivalent VOC content level of 420 grams of VOC per liter (3.5 lb/gal) of topcoat (less water and exempt solvents)
as applied. Equivalent organic HAP and VOC content level means the calculated organic HAP (or VOC) content of coatings
that when multiplied by the usage of the coatings yields the amount of organic HAP (or VOC) actually emitted to the atmosphere
by the use of the coatings. Exempt solvents are those organic compounds that have been determined by the EPA to have
negligible photochemical reactivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has received information indicating that the organic HAP and VOC content limits for topcoats do not represent
demonstrated technology for exterior commercial topcoats. Consequently, the EPA is soliciting comments on whether
a separate category should be developed for exterior commercial topcoats with HAP and VOC content levels higher than
the proposed levels for topcoats. These comments should provide a technical justification for a higher limit, including
why currently available commercial topcoats cannot be used by all sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sources would be allowed to comply with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content levels by one or both of the following
means: (1) Use coatings that individually comply with the organic HAP and VOC levels or (2) use any combination of uncontrolled
coatings such that the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC contents of these coatings comply with the
organic HAP and VOC levels for that category (averaging of primers and topcoats together is prohibited). Averaging
between uncontrolled coatings and controlled coatings is prohibited under the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of complying with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content levels through compliant coatings or averaging,
the proposed standards allow the use of control devices provided each control device used for the control of organic
HAP or VOC emissions from primer or topcoat application operations has an overall control efficiency, taking into
account capture and removal efficiency, of greater than or equal to 81 percent. In addition, except for incidental
emissions that may escape from the capture system, the control device cannot be used to control only a portion of emissions
from a coating operation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be shown on a monthly basis for compliant
coatings, and on a daily basis for coatings complying by averaging. Compliance for control devices other than carbon
adsorbers would be shown on a continuous basis based on a specific operating parameter or parameters, such as temperature
for incinerators. When a carbon adsorber is used to comply with the proposed standard, compliance with the 81 percent
overall control efficiency requirement must be demonstrated for each rolling material balance period. The length
of the rolling period will vary from source to source and is determined by the procedure specified in proposed Method
309 in the proposed rule. The minimum rolling period is one day, and the maximum rolling period is 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also proposing an equipment standard for the application of primers and topcoats. The proposed standard
would require the use of flow coat, roll coat, brush coat, dip coat, electrostatic attraction, or high volume low pressure
(HVLP) spray guns other than for the exemptions listed below. All application equipment would be required to be operated
and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications at all times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to allow other application equipment that is demonstrated to achieve emission levels equivalent
to HVLP or electrostatic spray guns. Compliance must be demonstrated by comparing the emissions generated by the
alternative application method to the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic application methods under actual
production conditions. The alternative method must generate emissions less than or equal to that generated by HVLP
or electrostatic spray methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the alternative application method test period, the owner or operator must ensure that the coating dried film
thickness is equivalent to that applied during the initial 90-day test period. This is required to ensure that the
owner or operator does not bias the test results by applying an excessive amount of coating during the initial 90-day
period and applying a minimal amount of coating during the alternative application method test period. The EPA is
requesting comments on whether the requirements of the proposed standards are sufficient to ensure that this situation
does not occur. Specifically, comments should address whether detailed recordkeeping should also be required in
order to determine that equivalent dried film thicknesses were applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to exempt the following situations and operations from the proposed equipment standards for
the application of primers and topcoats, although whatever application equipment is used would still be required
to be operated and maintained according to manufacturers specifications at all times: (1) Any situation that normally
requires the use of an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces, (2) the application of coatings
that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns and cannot be applied by any of the specified
application techniques, (3) the application of coatings that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0005
inch and cannot be applied by any of the specified application techniques, (4) the use of airbrush application methods
for stenciling, lettering, and other identification markings, and (5) touchup and repair operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inorganic HAP emissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The standards being proposed for inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would apply
to those operations that spray apply coatings that contain inorganic HAP (usually chromium, cadmium, and selenium).
Such operations would be required to be performed in a booth or hangar in which the air flow is directed across the part
or assembly being coated and exhausted through one or more outlets. This air stream would be required to pass through
either dry particulate filters or a waterwash system to remove the particulates before exhausting to the atmosphere.
In addition, the pressure drop across the filter or waterwash would have to be continuously monitored. If the pressure
drop moves outside of the limits specified by the manufacturer to maintain proper performance of the dry particulate
filters or waterwash system, then the operation must be shut down immediately and corrective action taken. The process
cannot resume until the pressure drop is returned to the limits specified by the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is requesting comments on whether pressure drop is an appropriate parameter on which to make continuous compliance
determinations with the inorganic HAP emission standards. The possibility exists that different filter or waterwash
manufacturers may specify different pressure drop limits for products with essentially the same performance. Since
the proposed standards rely on pressure drop as the basis for making compliance determinations, such a difference
would result in different requirements from one facility to another. Thus, the EPA is requesting comments specifically
on whether a standardized pressure drop limit can be established, or if another operating parameter exists on which
to make compliance determinations that would be consistent and enforceable for all types and brands of filters and
waterwash systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If pressure drop is selected as the parameter to be used to determine continuous compliance, then a violation of the
standards could occur under one of the following conditions: (1) Whenever the pressure drop moves outside the limits
specified by the manufacturer or (2) when the pressure drop is found to be outside the specified limits when monitored
and recorded once per operating shift. As the proposed rule is currently written, a violation would occur in the latter
situation. The EPA is requesting comments on which of these options, or another option, is most appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to exempt the following list of operations from the proposed standards for inorganic HAP emissions
from primer and topcoat application operations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Touch-up of scratched surfaces or damaged paint,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Hole daubing for fasteners,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Touch-up of trimmed edges,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Coating prior to joining dissimilar metal components,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Stencil operations performed by brush or air brush,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section joining, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Touch-up of bushings and other similar components.

3. Depainting Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards are being proposed for both organic HAP emissions and inorganic HAP emissions from depainting. With the
exception of the proposed standards for spot stripping and decal removal, as discussed below, the standards being
proposed for depainting would be the same for all new and existing affected sources. The proposed standards would
apply only to the depainting of the outer surface of entire aerospace vehicles, including the fuselage, wings, and
horizontal and vertical stabilizers of the aircraft, and the outer casing and stabilizers of missiles and rockets.
Standards for the depainting of parts, subassemblies, radomes, and parts normally removed from the completed vehicle
before depainting are not being proposed at this time. However, wings and stabilizers would always be required to
comply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Organic HAP emissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standards would require that there be no organic HAP emissions from the depainting operation. These
standards could be achieved through the use of (1) chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP or (2) media blasting
equipment, high intensity ultra-violet light blasting, or any other non-chemical depainting technique. However,
the proposed rule would allow the use of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper for spot stripping and decal removal.
The proposed rule would limit this use of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper to an average of 26 gallons per
aircraft for commercial aircraft and 50 gallons per aircraft for military aircraft, calculated on an annual basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-chemical-based depainting equipment would be required to be operated and maintained according to manufacturer's
specifications. During any period of malfunction, the owner or operator would be allowed to use a substitute material
to depaint the vehicles. Unless the substitute material does not contain any organic HAP, the substitute material
would not be allowed to be used for more than 14 consecutive days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule does not contain an annual limit on the number of days a source may use HAP-containing chemical strippers
during periods of malfunction of non-chemical-based depainting equipment. The EPA is requesting comments on whether
an annual limit should be imposed and, if so, technical justification for the number of days specified by the limit.

Inorganic HAP emissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule for inorganic HAP emissions would apply to those depainting methods (typically blasting methods)
that generate airborne particulate emissions, such as dust and paint particles, that contain inorganic HAP. The
proposed standards would require that the depainting operation be carried out in an enclosed hangar and that any air
stream removed from the depainting area be directed through a particulate filter (e.g., panel-type filter or baghouse)
before exhausting to the atmosphere. This filtration system must have a particulate removal efficiency greater
than or equal to 99 percent, and the pressure drop across the filter must be continuously monitored. If the pressure
drop moves outside of these limits as recorded each operational shift, then the operation must immediately be shut
down and corrective action taken. The process cannot resume until the pressure drop is within the limits specified
by the manufacturer.

4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for the chemical milling maskant application operation would be the same for all new and existing
affected sources and applies only to those operations utilizing a Type II chemical milling etchant. The proposed
standards would limit organic HAP emissions to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 160 grams of organic HAP
per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied, and limit the VOC emissions to an equivalent
VOC content level of 160 grams of VOC per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water and exempt solvents)
as applied. Alternatively, as for primer and topcoat application operations, control devices that achieve an overall
control efficiency of at least 81 percent and control all emissions (except for incidental emissions) may be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be allowed using one or both of the following
means: (1) Use chemical milling maskants that individually comply with the organic HAP and VOC content levels or (2)
use any combination of chemical milling maskants such that the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC
content levels of these chemical milling maskants used in the chemical milling maskant operation comply with the
organic HAP and VOC content levels. Averaging uncontrolled chemical milling maskants with controlled chemical
milling maskants, however, is prohibited under the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be shown on a monthly basis for compliant
chemical milling maskants and on a daily basis for chemical milling maskants complying by averaging. Compliance
for control devices other than carbon adsorbers would be shown on a continuous basis based on a specific operating
parameter or parameters, such as temperature for incinerators. When a carbon adsorber is used to comply with the proposed
standard, compliance with the 81 percent overall control efficiency requirement must be demonstrated for each rolling
material balance period. The length of the rolling period will vary from source to source and is determined by the procedure
specified in proposed Method 309 in the proposed rule. The minimum rolling period is one day, and the maximum rolling
period is 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for handling and storage of waste would be the same for all new and existing facilities. The
proposed rule would require that the handling and transfer of HAP-containing waste to or from containers, tanks,
vats, vessels, or piping systems be conducted in such a manner that minimizes spills. In addition, all HAP-containing
waste would be stored in closed containers.

the standards. In addition, the proposed rule adopts the compliance dates specified in &sect;63.6(b) and &sect;63.6(c)
of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

During development of the aerospace national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP), the EPA
received comments from the regulated community regarding the process that would be used to comply with the rule and
certain difficulties that were anticipated, particularly with the facilities' selection and approval of product
substitutions for coatings and hand-wipe cleaning solvents. Because of the large number of product substitutions
that may have to undergo testing and qualification at each facility, some facilities may need to request a compliance
extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 63.6(i) of 40 CFR part 63 provides the requirements for requesting an extension of compliance with a relevant
standard established under part 63.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, &sect;63.6(i)(4) allows the issuance of a permit granting an extension of up to one year to comply with
the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. Section 63.6(i)(4)(i)(B)
requires requests for compliance extensions to be submitted no later than 12 months before the affected source's
compliance date.

1. Test Methods and Procedures

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cleaning operation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For multi-component cleaning solvents, compliance with the proposed vapor pressure specifications would be determined
using E 260&hyph;85 to quantify the amount of each organic compound in the cleaning solvent. The vapor pressure of
each organic compound would be determined from the manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts,
or other equivalent methods. The total composite vapor pressure would then be calculated by summing the partial vapor
pressure of each component according to Raoult's Law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For single component cleaning solvents, the EPA is proposing that vapor pressure data supplied by the manufacturer
of the cleaning solvent, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods be used for compliance
determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators seeking to comply with the cleaning solvent approved composition list would have to show compliance
using data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent. The data must identify all components of the cleaning
solvent and demonstrate that one of the approved composition definitions is met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primer and topcoat application operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted earlier, the proposed standards for organic HAP and VOC emissions would require compliance with an equivalent
organic HAP content level (pounds of organic HAP per gallon of coating (less water) as applied) and an equivalent VOC
content level (pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied) for primers and for
topcoats. Compliance with these organic HAP and VOC content levels may be accomplished by using compliant coatings,
averaging between compliant and non-compliant coatings, control devices, or any combination of these methods.
In addition, the proposed standards would require the use of certain application techniques for the application
of primers and topcoats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test methods and procedures have been identified for compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content levels. No test
methods or procedures have been identified for the application equipment requirements; however, a test method has
been identified for the qualification of alternative application methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 24 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 would be used to determine the VOC content of each primer and topcoat as applied.
Alternatively, manufacturer's data may be used to determine the VOC content of these coatings. However, in the event
of any inconsistency between manufacturer's data and Method 24 test results, the Method 24 test results will take
precedence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility may rely on manufacturer's data to determine the organic HAP content level of each coating. The total
organic HAP weight fraction and density of each coating as received would be determined using the manufacturer's
data. The volume of each primer and topcoat used would be determined using company records. If diluent solvents or
other ingredients are added to a primer or topcoat prior to application, then the total organic HAP and VOC weight fractions,
density, and volume must be adjusted appropriately to account for such additions. These values would be required
for each 24-hour period; however, only changes in formulation would require re-determination of total organic HAP
and VOC weight fractions and density.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards would then require the owner or operator to calculate the volume-weighted average mass of
both VOC and organic HAP in coatings emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents for VOC; less water
for HAP) as applied. This calculation would be performed for each 24-hour period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner or operator is seeking to comply by using compliant coatings, the owner or operator would need to determine
the organic HAP content (less water as applied) and VOC content (less water and exempt solvents as applied). If no changes
in formulation as applied occurred, then a re-calculation of the organic HAP and VOC content levels would not be required.
Where compliant coatings are used, the proposed rule would require the determination of the organic HAP content using
manufacturer's data and VOC content using Method 24 or manufacturer's data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a control device is used, the proposed standards require the owner or operator to conduct an initial performance
test to demonstrate compliance with the overall control efficiency requirement of at least 81 percent. The percent
reduction achieved by a control device may be determined based either on total organic compounds (TOC) minus methane
and ethane or on total organic HAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a carbon adsorber, the overall control efficiency would be determined using a mass balance. The mass balance calculation
would be made every rolling period (the length of the rolling period will vary from facility to facility and will range
from 1 to 30 days).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, the overall control efficiency would be based on capture efficiency
and destruction efficiency. Capture efficiency would be determined based on the procedure specified in &sect;52.741(a)(4)(iii)
of 40 CFR subpart O, unless the operation is performed within a total enclosure. An enclosure that meets the requirements
of a total enclosure as specified in &sect;52.741, appendix B, Procedure T of 40 CFR subpart O would have a capture efficiency
of 100 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The destruction efficiency of a control device other than a carbon adsorber would be determined using the following
methods. Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, would be used for selection of the sampling sites,
and the gas volumetric flow rate would be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate.
Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, would then be used to measure either TOC minus methane and ethane or total organic
HAP at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Also, any other test methods or data that have been validated according
to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards would also allow the use of alternative application methods provided that they generate organic
HAP and VOC emissions less than or equal to the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray guns. The emission
levels of the alternative application method must be determined under actual production conditions. This test would
first involve determining the organic HAP and VOC emissions for the 90-day period immediately preceding the implementation
of the alternative application method. During this initial 90-day period, only HVLP or electrostatic spray guns
would be used. The alternative method would then be used on actual production parts or assemblies for a period of time
sufficient to coat an equivalent amount of parts and assemblies as coated in the initial 90-day period. Coatings used
during the test period must be the same as those used during the initial 90-day period. In addition, the dried film thickness
must be equivalent to that applied during the initial 90-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organic HAP and VOC emissions for the period of time where the alternative method was used would then be calculated.
Where the organic HAP and VOC emissions after implementation of the alternative method are less than or equal to the
emissions for the initial 90-day period, the alternative application method is in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), in conjunction with the California Air Resources Board
(CARB), is currently developing a test protocol to measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment.
This test protocol would represent an alternative method of qualifying application equipment for use under the proposed
standards. Since this test protocol is still under development, the EPA is requesting comments from those familiar
with this test protocol or any other transfer efficiency laboratory test method concerning the ability of these procedures
to accurately and repeatedly measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment. In addition, the EPA
is requesting comments on other methods that may be used to measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment.

Depainting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the organic HAP emissions portion of the proposed standards for depainting, the only test method or procedure
that would be required is the determination of the organic HAP content of each chemical stripper. The proposed standards
would require the use of information supplied by the manufacturer to determine the organic HAP content. If the organic
HAP content of the chemical stripper cannot be determined from manufacturer's data, then the owner or operator would
submit an alternative procedure for determining the organic HAP content for approval by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the annual limit on the gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used for spot stripping and decal
removal, the total annual volume as applied of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper and the number of aircraft
depainted would be determined from company records. The proposed standards would then require the owner or operator
to calculate the gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used per aircraft. This calculation would
be performed for each annual period.

The proposed standards require inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations to be reduced by 99 percent using
particulate filters such as baghouses, cartridge filters, or dry filter media. The EPA is proposing the use of Method
5 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine removal efficiency. The proposed standards would require retesting whenever
the particulate filter or supplier of the filter media changes, or whenever modifications are made to the emission
collection system.

The same basic test methods and procedures identified for primer and topcoat application operations are also being
proposed for chemical milling maskants, requiring the determination of total organic HAP weight fraction, density,
and volume of chemical milling maskants as applied. Simpler procedures are being proposed, as for primer and topcoat
application operations, to demonstrate compliance where only compliant chemical milling maskants are being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for primer and topcoat application operations, any control device, including a carbon adsorber, used to control
emissions from chemical milling maskant application operations must have an overall control efficiency of at least
81 percent and must control, except for incidental emissions, all of the emissions from the maskant operation. Test
methods that would be used to determine the overall control efficiency are identical to those given previously for
primer and topcoat application operations.

2. Monitoring Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monitoring is required by the proposed standards to determine whether a source is in continuous compliance. This
can be accomplished by continuously measuring site-specific operating parameters, the values of which are established
by the owner or operator during the initial compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined as the minimum
or maximum value established for a control device or process parameter that, if achieved by itself or in combination
with other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator is complying with the applicable emission
limitation or standards. This type of enhanced monitoring would be required for those emission points for which the
standards are expressed as a percent control. In addition, the owner or operator is expected to install and operate
the equipment properly. For owners or operators complying with the proposed standards for spray gun cleaning through
the use of enclosed spray gun cleaners, compliance would be demonstrated through recordkeeping (see section II.F).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require temperature to be monitored, using a continuous recorder, for incinerators. For
catalytic incinerators, temperature monitors would be placed immediately before and after the catalyst bed. For
other incinerators, the temperature monitor would be placed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream
of the firebox and before any substantial heat exchange occurs. All monitoring equipment would be installed, calibrated,
maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 63.6(g) of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, allows an owner or operator of an affected source to request the use of alternative
methods of emission reduction for complying with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards,
or combination thereof, established under this part.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator of an affected source may also use control devices other than those specifically
identified in the proposed rule as a means for achieving compliance with any portion of the rule. If devices other than
those identified are used, the proposed standards would require the owner or operator to submit the parameters to
be monitored to the Administrator for approval.

The proposed standards would require each owner or operator to establish a range of values for each of these monitored
parameters during the initial performance test. As long as the control device is operated within the established
ranges, the proposed emission standards are considered to be met. Consequently, exceedances of these parameters
would be considered a violation of the standards since operating the control device outside of the parameters may
reduce the efficiency of the control device.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule proposes to adopt the requirements contained in &sect;63.9 (a) through (e) and &sect;63.9 (h) through
(j) and &sect;63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of 40 CFR part 63,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule, however, contains additional or clarifying elements and changes certain time periods allowed
for submitting or responding to certain reports and requests required in &sect;63.10. These elements and changes
are summarized below for each of the operations for which standards are being proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cleaning operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each cleaning solvent used at the facility, the proposed rule would require a record of the name of the cleaning
solvent and documentation that shows the organic HAP constituents of the cleaning solvent. For each cleaning solvent
used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that conforms to the approved composition list, the records that would be maintained
are the name of each cleaning solvent, documentation demonstrating compliance to the approved composition list,
and annual purchasing records showing the annual volume purchased of each. For each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe
cleaning operations that does not conform to the approved composition list but does conform to the vapor pressure
requirement, the information required to be recorded would be the name of each cleaning solvent, the monthly usage
of the cleaning solvent at each operation, the composite vapor pressure, the manufacturer's data sheets or other
documentation of the vapor pressure, and any test reports and calculations performed to determine the composite
vapor pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For cleaning solvents that do not conform to either the composition or vapor pressure requirements and are used for
the exempt cleaning operations, daily records must be maintained of the name and volume of each cleaning solvent at
each operation at which it is used, and the parts, assemblies, or subassemblies cleaned at these operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a record of all leaks from spray gun cleaners would be kept, including source identification, the date
that the leak was discovered, and the date that the leak was repaired.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primer and topcoat application operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For all primers and topcoats used at the facility, records must be maintained of the name of each primer and topcoat
and its organic HAP and VOC content as received. In addition, the EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping
requirements depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content levels are met. For primers or topcoats that are individually
compliant with the organic HAP and VOC content limits, records would be required of the organic HAP and VOC content
as applied, all data, calculations, and test results (including Method 24 results taken during an enforcement inspection)
used in determining the organic HAP and VOC contents as applied, and the monthly usage of each coating formulation
within each coating category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If averaging among compliant and non-compliant coatings is used to achieve compliance, then the proposed standards
would require that up-to-date records of daily volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP and VOC contained in the
coatings as applied be maintained. This information would include all data and calculations used in determining
these daily values, such as manufacturer's data certifying the organic HAP content of each coating as applied and
Method 24 test results (including those taken during an enforcement inspection) or manufacturer's data that show
the VOC content as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a control device is used to comply with the organic HAP or VOC content limit for primers or topcoats, up-to-date records
must be kept on the control device. Each owner or operator would be required to keep records of the equipment monitoring
parameter measurements specified in the proposed rule. For an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator, continuous
records must be maintained of the firebox temperature (or temperature in the ductwork immediately downstream of
the firebox). For a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be maintained of the gas stream temperature immediately
before and after the catalyst bed. For both types of incinerators, records must be maintained of the overall control
efficiency and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For carbon adsorbers, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency, all test results, data, and calculations
used in determining the overall control efficiency, and the length of the rolling material balance period and all
of its supporting data and calculations used to determine the rolling period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations, either particulate filters or waterwash
spray booths would be used to achieve compliance. Records must be maintained of the manufacturer's recommended limits
for the pressure drop and readings of the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash that are taken once each shift
during which the coating processes are in operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depainting operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each owner or operator of a depainting operation would be required to keep up-to-date records of the name of each chemical
stripper used, the organic HAP content of each stripper and its supporting documentation, and the monthly volume
usage of each chemical stripper that contains organic HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For non-chemical depainting methods, such as media blasting, owners and operators would be required to maintain
records of the type of non-chemical-based equipment used and a description of any malfunctions that occur. If a malfunction
occurs, the information to be kept would be the dates the malfunction occurred and was corrected, the methods used
to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction, and the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for depainting contains exemptions for parts stripping, spot stripping, and decal removal,
each of which requires certain records to be maintained. For parts stripping, records must be maintained for each
model of aerospace vehicle of the parts normally removed from the vehicle. For spot stripping and decal removal, annual
records must be maintained of the number of aircraft stripped, the volume of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper
used for spot stripping and decal removal, the average number of gallons of organic HAP-containing stripper used
per aircraft, and all supporting data and calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations, either particulate filters or baghouses (equipped with
either bag or cartridge filter media) would be used to achieve compliance. Records must be maintained of the filter
manufacturer's recommended pressure drop limits and the readings of the pressure drop across the filter taken once
each shift during which the depainting process is in operation. Also, records must be maintained of the particulate
control efficiency of each filter and all test results, data, and calculations used to determine the control efficiency.

Chemical milling maskant application operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping requirements depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content
levels are being met. For chemical milling maskants that are individually compliant with the organic HAP and VOC content
levels, records of the volume-weighted average masses of organic HAP and VOC emitted as applied must be kept. In addition,
all data and calculations used to determine these values and the monthly volume of each chemical milling maskant formulation
used each month must be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If averaging among compliant and non-compliant chemical milling maskants is used to achieve compliance, then the
proposed standards would require that up-to-date records of daily volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP and
VOC contained in the chemical milling maskants as applied be maintained. This information would include all data
and calculations used in determining these daily values, such as formulation data and Method 24 test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for primer and topcoat application operations, if a control device is used, up-to-date records must be kept on the
control device. Each owner or operator would be required to keep records of the equipment monitoring parameter measurements
specified in the proposed rule. For an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be
maintained of the firebox temperature (or temperature in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox). For
a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be maintained of the gas stream temperature immediately before
and after the catalyst bed. For both types of incinerators, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency
and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Handling and storage of waste. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each owner or operator would be required under the proposed standards to keep an up-to-date record of each waste stream
generated at the facility, identification of which wastes are subject to RCRA and which are not, and documentation
supporting those determinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require four basic types of reports: (1) Initial notification, (2) notification of compliance
status, (3) periodic reports, and (4) other reports. In addition, the proposed rule would require that the results
of any performance test required under &sect;63.7 of the General Provisions to 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, be reported
no later than 30 days after the completion of the test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As stated above, the proposed standards adopt the reporting requirements contained in &sect;63.9(a) through &sect;63.9(e)
and &sect;63.9(h) through &sect;63.9(j) and 63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A. However, the
time period allowed for the Administrator to notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of
the request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline submitted under &sect;63.9(i) has
been changed to within 30 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request, rather than
15 calendar days as provided for in &sect;63.9(i)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 40 CFR 63.9 and 63.10 of the General Provisions identify the type of generic information to be included in
the initial notification, notification of compliance status, and other reports and, therefore, this information
is not repeated in this preamble. The following paragraphs summarize the additional information specific to the
aerospace rule that should be included in the notification of compliance status and the type of information to be included
in the periodic reports.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cleaning operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notification of compliance status should include an identification of each cleaning solvent used at the facility,
a description of the procedures to be used to ensure that bags and containers are kept closed when not in use and that
cleaning solvents are stored in closed containers, the name of each cleaning solvent that does not conform to the approved
composition list, and the vapor pressure test results of each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific to spray gun cleaning, the notification of compliance status should also contain a detailed description
of all methods used to clean spray guns and an explanation as to how each cleaning method complies with the proposed
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information to be included in the semiannual report covers all noncompliance situations such as using a hand-wipe
cleaning solvent that does not conform to the approved composition list or vapor pressure requirements used in a non-exempt
operation. In addition, the semiannual report includes information on new cleaning solvents used for hand-wipe
cleaning in the previous six months, as well as previously reported cleaning solvents no longer in use. The information
to be provided is a list of any new cleaning solvents used in the previous six months, a list of new non-HAP cleaning solvents,
if any, used, and, for new cleaning solvents used in hand-wipe cleaning operations, the composite vapor pressure
of each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the cleaning operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required occurring
every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the cleaning operation has been in compliance with
the applicable standards.

Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations, the notification of compliance status
should identify the combination of compliant coatings, averaging, and control devices that were used to demonstrate
that the facility was in compliance, and, for control devices, what operating parameters were identified for continuous
monitoring in order to ensure continuous compliance with the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners and operators complying with the organic HAP and VOC content levels for primer, topcoat, and chemical milling
maskant application operations would be required to report each exceedance of the organic HAP or VOC content level,
as well as any time a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across
the filters or waterwash was out of range. These reports would be submitted on a semiannual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If control devices are used, semiannual reports would be required that contain information on all days when the average
values of the parameters required to be monitored were outside the ranges established in the operating permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For incinerators, this would be whenever each 3-hour average temperature was below the average temperature established
during the most recent performance test during which compliance was demonstrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no exceedances occur, each owner and operator would submit annual statements indicating that each affected facility
has been in compliance. The annual reports for primer and topcoat application operations would also identify the
number of times, if any, the pressure drop limits for each filter or waterwash system were exceeded.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depainting operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notification of compliance status for depainting operations should identify each chemical stripper used at
the facility to depaint aerospace vehicles and the organic HAP content of each. Each chemical stripper that contains
organic HAP and is used for decal removal, depainting of parts, and spot stripping would also be identified. In addition,
the types of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques used at the facility and the manufacturer's recommended
pressure drop across the filters for the particulate removal system, if applicable, would be identified. Finally,
each owner or operator would be required to describe the depainting methods to be used during periods of malfunction
of the non-chemical depainting methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information to be included in the semiannual report would include the name of any new chemical strippers used during
the previous six months and the organic HAP content of each. For each chemical stripper used for depainting operations
that undergoes reformulation, its organic HAP content after reformulation would be submitted with the semiannual
report. The report would also be required if the owner or operator used any new non-chemical depainting technique
at the facility since the initial report or any subsequent semiannual report. The semiannual report would be required
to identify each 24-hour period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting operation except from the exempt
operations, any periods of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques, and any periods where
the non-chemical depainting operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the filters was
out of range. For each malfunction that occurs, the following information would be reported: (1) The piece of equipment
that malfunctioned, (2) the date the malfunction occurred and the date it was corrected, (3) a description of the malfunction,
(4) the alternate methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction period, and (5) the dates
that these methods were begun and discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the semiannual report would be required to identify all changes in the type of aircraft depainted at the facility
and to identify the parts normally removed for depainting separate from the aircraft for each new type of aircraft
depainted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For spot stripping and decal removal, an annual report would be required whenever the average volume per aircraft
of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used exceeds the limits specified in the proposed rule for the annual
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the depainting operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required every
12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the depainting operation has been in compliance with the
applicable standards. This annual report would also detail how many times the pressure drop limits for each filter
system were exceeded and report when the calculated annual average volume of organic HAP-containing strippers used
per aircraft for spot stripping and decal removal exceeded the applicable limits.

The notification of compliance status would identify each waste stream and identify whether it is RCRA or non-RCRA
regulated. The notification would also include a description of the procedures to be used to ensure that spills are
minimized during handling and transfer operations. Also included would be the procedures to be used to ensure that
waste is stored in closed containers.

III. Summary of Environmental, Energy, and Economic Impacts of the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Emission Reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Existing Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the existing aerospace OEM and rework facilities (approximately 2,869 facilities in the base year 1991), the
nationwide baseline HAP emissions are estimated to be 189,000 Mg/yr (208,000 tpy). Implementation of the proposed
regulation would reduce these emissions by approximately 112,600 Mg/yr (123,700 tpy), or 59 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. New Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the aerospace industry, no net growth is expected over the next five years; therefore, no net emission reduction
due to new facilities is anticipated during this period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Secondary Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Secondary environmental impacts are considered to be any air, water, or solid waste impacts, positive or negative,
associated with the implementation of the proposed standards. These impacts are exclusive of the direct air emission
reductions discussed in the previous section. All of the impacts discussed below reflect the maximum increase or
decrease, as appropriate, that would occur if all of the affected sources converted to the control option described.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some product reformulations that may be used to comply with the proposed standards for hand-wipe cleaning, primers,
and topcoats may contain organic HAP or VOC not present in the original product. In these cases, different organic
HAP or VOC may be emitted as a result of the proposed rule, but the overall level of these compounds that are emitted will
decrease. Chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP used for depainting may result in increased VOC emissions
when used to replace methylene chloride-based chemical strippers (methylene chloride is a HAP, but not a VOC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a potential for an impact on water quality resulting from some of the prescribed control measures. Under baseline
conditions for chemical milling maskant operations, no wastewater is generated; however, some of the sources may
install a carbon adsorber to control solvent emissions. If all affected sources use carbon adsorbers, the amount
of water needed to create regenerating steam for these systems, which will add to the wastewater burden from these
sources, is estimated to be 447 million gallons per year nationwide. For depainting operations, there are two options
available for meeting the proposed rule, both of which will result in a decrease in the amount of wastewater generated
compared to baseline, which is 251 million gallons per year. The decrease in wastewater nationwide is estimated to
be 251 million gallons and 86 million gallons if all affected sources use dry media blasting or chemical strippers
that do not contain organic HAP, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sources installing a carbon adsorption system on their chemical milling maskant operations would generate additional
solid waste due to the necessity of periodically disposing of spent activated carbon. If all affected sources use
carbon adsorbers, this added nationwide solid waste burden is estimated to be 4,500 tons per year, compared to the
baseline of 21,200 tons per year. Rework facilities that presently use a methylene chloride-based paint stripper
must dispose of 3,469 tons per year of paint/solvent sludge created by depainting. A total conversion to dry media
paint removal would produce an increase in the amount of solid waste composed of dry paint chips and spent blasting
media. This increase in solid waste is estimated to be 13,280 tons per year on a nationwide basis. The proposed standards
for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would result in the increase
in solid waste generation from the disposal of used dry filter media. The increased solid waste burden is estimated
to be 640 tons per year, compared to the baseline solid waste generation of 3,540 tons per year.

C. Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the control measures proposed for aerospace manufacturing and rework operations would lead to increases
in energy consumption. Both of the control options for chemical milling maskant operations, operation of a carbon
adsorber or conversion to waterborne chemical milling maskant, would involve increased electricity usage (waterborne
chemical milling maskants must be cured at elevated temperatures). The total additional energy needed if all affected
sources operate new carbon adsorbers is estimated to be 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, and the energy
increase for all affected sources to operate new curing ovens for waterborne chemical milling maskants is estimated
at 324,700 kWh per year. Baseline energy consumption for chemical milling maskant operations is considered to be
negligible since the use of solvent-based chemical milling maskants does not directly require the use of electricity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dry media paint removal systems that would be installed at rework facilities consume additional energy compared
to the solvent stripping method. Baseline energy consumption for solvent stripping is considered to be negligible
since the use of these strippers does not directly require the use of electricity. The increase in energy consumption
involved in operating dry media blasting systems is estimated to be 51 million kWh per year. The use of chemical strippers
that do not contain organic HAP is essentially the same as the baseline solvent stripping operation; therefore, no
energy impact will result from their use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations
would require some facilities to install additional spray booths. These spray booths, whether equipped with dry
filters or waterwash, will increase the energy consumption of the affected sources. This increase in energy consumption
is estimated to be 5.9 million kWh per year, compared to the baseline energy consumption of 117.4 million kWh per year.

D. Cost Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total capital and annualized control costs (1992 dollars), including recovery credits, attributable to compliance
with the proposed standards have been estimated for both existing and new facilities. The following two subsections
summarize the results of this cost analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Capital costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Capital costs would be incurred with the implementation of control measures for chemical milling maskants (both
solvent-based chemical milling maskants with a carbon adsorber and waterborne chemical milling maskants), dry
media blasting for depainting, spray gun cleaning, and control of HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and depainting
operations. With the exception of dry media blasting for depainting, the nationwide capital costs listed below represent
the maximum costs that would be incurred assuming that all facilities implemented the specific control option. For
dry media blasting, it is not reasonable to assume that all commercial and military rework facilities (a total of 2,026
facilities) depaint the outer surface of aerospace vehicles. Therefore, it was assumed that only 5 percent of the
small and medium size rework facilities and all of the large rework facilities perform outer surface depainting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For carbon adsorbers used in conjunction with solvent-based chemical milling maskants, the nationwide capital
cost is estimated to be $500 million, and for waterborne chemical milling maskants it is estimated to be $289 million.
The implementation of dry media blasting systems for depainting would require a nationwide capital cost of $61 million.
It should be noted that other control measures exist for depainting other than dry media blasting, such as chemical
strippers that do not contain organic HAP, that require no capital investment. Selection of chemical strippers that
do not contain organic HAP by all affected sources instead of dry media blasting would decrease the total nationwide
capital investment by approximately 10 percent. The proposed rule would also require capital costs for high transfer
efficiency application equipment and spray gun cleaning equipment totalling $130 million and $10 million, respectively.
The control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would require the installation
of spray booths and filter systems at a capital cost of $13 million.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Total nationwide capital costs range from $503 million to $714 million, depending on which chemical milling maskant
control option is used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All of the control options will result in some annual costs being incurred by the affected sources. However, the annualized
cost figures presented below reflect the net cost to implement the control options after taking into account the costs
that would have been incurred for baseline. This net cost (MACT cost minus baseline cost) resulted in net annual savings
for primers, topcoats, and high transfer efficiency application methods; spray gun cleaning; and the use of chemical
strippers that do not contain organic HAP. All other options resulted in net annual costs to the affected sources.
The net cost (or savings) for all control options reflects the maximum cost (or savings) that would be incurred assuming
all affected sources implemented the specific control option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one cost analysis was completed for primers, topcoats, and high transfer efficiency application methods due
to the interrelationship between these operations. For example, high transfer efficiency application methods
will result in a lower volume of primers and topcoats being applied. In addition, the organic HAP and VOC limits on primers
and topcoats will, due to higher solids content, also result in a lower volume of the coatings being applied. The reduction
in coating usage due to the lower organic HAP and VOC content had to be taken into account first, then the reduction in
coating usage due to high transfer efficiency application methods was applied to this reduced coating volume to obtain
the true overall reduction in coating usage. After factoring in the annualized cost of the coating equipment, the
analysis showed a nationwide savings of $71 million for commercial sources and $18 million for military sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The savings for primers, topcoats, and high transfer efficiency application methods are due primarily to labor savings
that would result from the reduced volume of coatings to be applied. For example, if it would have taken 15 gallons of
primer under baseline conditions to coat an aircraft and only 12 gallons under MACT conditions, then the cost analysis
assumes a labor savings for the 3 gallons of primer that were not applied. The EPA has received some evidence, however,
that the labor stays the same or may even increase with the use of high transfer efficiency application methods (specifically
HVLP spray guns). The EPA requests comments from facilities that have converted from conventional spray guns to HVLP
spray guns regarding the labor hours per gallon of coating applied for each application method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For spray gun cleaning, the proposed standards would result in a nationwide savings of approximately $56 million.
This is due primarily to reduced solvent usage and associated spent solvent disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP would result in a nationwide savings of approximately
$2 million. While the cost of non-HAP strippers is generally higher than the cost of conventional strippers, this
cost is offset by the reduced disposal costs incurred with non-HAP strippers. Since non-HAP strippers do not contain
methylene chloride, they can typically be treated on-site. This eliminates the disposal costs incurred with the
conventional strippers, which are typically shipped off-site for disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nationwide annual costs are estimated to be $14 million for hand-wipe and flush cleaning, $111 million for waterborne
chemical milling maskants, $2 million for inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations,
and $0.3 million for inorganic HAP emissions from blast depainting operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Total nationwide costs, taking into account both the savings and costs detailed above, are estimated to be a savings
of $20 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sources subject to the proposed rule would be required to perform certain monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting
tasks. These information collection requirements will create a burden on the affected sources in terms of resources
needed to comply with these requirements (see section VI.D.). The total nationwide costs of the manpower requirements
to complete these tasks are estimated to be $36.7 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total nationwide costs are estimated to be $16.7 million, which is the sum of the annualized costs (a total nationwide
savings of $20 million) and the costs due to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements (a total nationwide
cost of $36.7 million).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the aerospace industry, no net growth is expected over the next five years; therefore, no net costs (or savings)
due to new facilities are anticipated during this period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Economic Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the low total compliance costs associated with the proposed regulation, the discussion of the economic impacts
is presented in a qualitative manner. The low costs of the proposed regulation are in a large part due to cost savings
expected to be achieved by some model plants. The economic impact analysis discussed in a qualitative manner the primary
impacts (the direction of price and output changes in the aerospace industry), as well as secondary impacts (the direction
of changes in the demands for inputs such as coatings) associated with the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost estimates indicate that the total annual compliance costs are approximately $16.7 million. In 1990, revenue
for this industry equalled approximately $118.9 billion. Using revenue data as a proxy for production costs, the
costs of the proposed regulation are only 0.01 percent of the total production costs for the industry. This increase
in production cost is expected to have minimal impact on the current prices and outputs of the aerospace industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary impacts refer to changes in factor demand by all aerospace producers. For example, while the primary impact
of the regulation on spray gun cleaning is a decrease in the cost of performing this task, the actual cause of the decrease
in the cost is a reduction in the use of methyl ethyl ketone and other solvents. Although compliance with the proposed
regulation is expected to reduce consumption of coatings and solvents in general and, therefore, negatively impact
the producers of these products, compliance with the proposed regulation is also expected to increase product substitution
so that demand for non-HAP strippers, waterborne maskants, and low vapor pressure solvents will increase. Lack of
economic data on a product-specific basis prevents quantification of the indicated impacts.

A. Process Descriptions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aerospace manufacturing and rework operations consist of the following basic operations: Chemical milling maskant
application, chemical milling, adhesive bonding, cleaning (e.g., hand-wipe, spray equipment, and flush), metal
finishing, electrodeposition, coating application (e.g., primers, topcoats, sealants, and specialty coatings),
depainting, and composite processing. In addition, most aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities generate
waste and wastewater, and some facilities have storage tanks for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. An aerospace facility
may conduct all of these processes in its operations, such as an OEM facility that produces the entire aircraft. However,
an aerospace facility may conduct only a subset of these operations, such as a facility that produces a single component
or assembly, or a facility that provides a service such as chemical milling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Chemical Milling Maskant Application and Chemical Milling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical milling uses etchant solutions to reduce the thickness of selected areas of metal parts in order to reduce
weight. The process is typically used when the size or shape of the part precludes mechanical milling or when chemical
milling is advantageous due to shorter processing time or its batch capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical milling maskants are typically rubber- or polymeric-based coatings applied to an entire part or subassembly
by brushing, dipping, spraying, or flow coating. After the chemical milling maskant is cured, it is removed from selected
areas of the part where metal is to be removed during the chemical milling process. The chemical milling maskant remaining
on the part protects those areas from the etchant solution. Chemical milling maskants typically contain either a
toluene/xylene mixture or perchloroethylene as its solvent constituents.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Organic HAP emissions occur through evaporation of the solvent as the chemical milling maskant is applied and while
it cures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Adhesive Bonding (Adhesives and Adhesive Bonding Primers) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adhesive bonding involves the joining together of two or more metal parts, such as the parts of a honeycomb core. This
process is typically performed when the joints being formed are essential to the structural integrity of the aircraft.
The surfaces to be bonded are first coated with an adhesive bonding primer to promote adhesion and protect from subsequent
corrosion. Structural adhesives are applied as either a thin film or as a paste, and can be oven cured or cured in an autoclave.
Organic HAP emissions occur from the evaporation of solvents contained in the adhesive bonding primer and adhesive
during their application, as well as during the curing step. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Cleaning Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hand-wipe and flush cleaning.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Aerospace components are cleaned frequently during manufacturing to remove contaminants such as dirt, grease,
and oil, and to prepare the components for the next operation. Cleaning is typically performed by a hand wiping process
using a wide variety of cleaning solvents. Assemblies and parts with concealed or inaccessible areas may be flush
cleaned by pouring the cleaning solvent over or into the part. The cleaning solvent is then drained from the part and
the procedure is repeated as many times as necessary to ensure the required cleanliness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions from hand-wipe and flush cleaning operations occur from the evaporation of cleaning solvents
during the cleaning process, including evaporation of the solvent from open containers and from solvent-soaked
cloth and paper. Organic HAP emissions also occur from storage tanks used to store cleaning solvents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spray gun cleaning.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Spray guns and other components of coating units must be cleaned when switching from one coating to another and when
they are not going to be immediately reused. The cleaning of spray guns can be performed either manually or with enclosed
spray gun cleaners. Manual cleaning involves disassembling the gun and placing the parts in a vat containing an appropriate
cleaning solvent. The residual paint is brushed or wiped off the parts. After reassembling, the cleaning solvent
may be sprayed through the gun for a final cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enclosed spray gun cleaners are self-contained units that pump the cleaning solvent through the gun within a closed
chamber. After the cleaning cycle is complete, the guns are removed from the chamber and typically undergo some manual
cleaning to remove coating residue from areas not exposed to the cleaning solvent, such as the seals under the atomizing
cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions from spray gun cleaning occur from the evaporation of cleaning solvents during the cleaning
cycle, such as while hand cleaning the guns in an open vat. Organic HAP emissions also occur from enclosed spray gun
cleaners when they are opened to remove the guns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Metal Finishing and Electrodeposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Metal finishing processes are used to prepare the surface of a part for better adhesion, improved surface hardness,
and improved corrosion resistance. Typical metal finishing operations include conversion coating, anodizing,
desmutting, descaling, and any operation that chemically affects the surface layer of a part.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Electrodeposition, or metal plating, is an additive process for metal substrates in which another metal layer is
added to the substrate in order to enhance corrosion and wear resistance necessary for the successful performance
of the component. The two types of electrodeposition typically used are electroplating and plasma arc spraying.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP emissions from metal finishing operations occur in the form of gases or vapors that evaporate from the surface
of processing solutions. Evaporation of solution also occurs from the parts as they are removed from the processing
tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Coating Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A coating is a material that is applied to the surface of a part to form a decorative or functional solid film. The most
common coatings are the broad categories of non-specialized primers and topcoats. There are also numerous specialty
coatings ranging from temporary protective coatings to radiation effect coatings designed to shield aircraft from
radar detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coatings are applied to aerospace vehicles and components using several methods of application. The methods most
commonly used are spraying, brushing, rolling, flow coating, and dipping. Spray application systems include conventional
air spray, airless spray, air-assisted airless, electrostatic, and high volume low pressure (HVLP) spray. These
latter two methods are generally accepted as having better transfer efficiency than other spraying methods and are
gaining increased use as a means of using less coating and, hence, reducing emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly all aerospace coatings contain a mixture of organic solvents. Organic HAP emissions from coating application
occur from the evaporation of the solvents during mixing, application, and drying. Inorganic HAP emissions of metal
compounds (e.g., chromium and cadmium) also occur from overspray, which is exhausted from spray booths or paint spray
hangars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Depainting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The depainting operation involves the removal of coatings from the outer surface of aircraft. The two basic depainting
methods are chemical depainting and blast depainting. Chemical depainting agents are applied to the aircraft, allowed
to degrade the coating, and then scraped or washed off with the coating residue. Blast depainting methods utilize
a media such as plastic, wheat starch, carbon dioxide, or high pressure water to remove coatings by physically abrading
the coatings from the surface of the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions from chemical depainting occur from evaporation of the solvents in the stripping solution.
The amount of emissions from the process is directly related to the surface area being stripped, the type and thickness
of coating to be removed, and the effectiveness of the stripper. Inorganic HAP emissions occur from the various blast
depainting methods. The inorganic HAP are contained in the coatings being removed (trace amounts of inorganic HAP
may also be found in some blast media) and are emitted as particulates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Composite Processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Composite processing consists of seven basic operations: Layup, thermal forming, debulking, curing, break-out,
compression molding, and injection molding. Layup is the process of assembling the layers of the composite structure
by positioning composite material in a mold and impregnating the material with a resin. Thermal forming is the process
of forming the layup in a mold, which usually takes place in an autoclave. During the thermal forming process, debulking
also may occur, which is the simultaneous application of low-level heat and pressure to the composite structure to
force out excess resin, trapped air, vapor, and volatiles from between the layers of the composite structure. The
curing step, which is the process of changing the resin into a solid material through a polymerization reaction, also
occurs in the autoclave. After curing and removal from the autoclave, the break-out process removes the composite
structure from the molds or curing fixtures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other methods of forming composite structures are compression molding and injection molding. Compression molding
is the process of filling one half of a mold with a molding compound, closing the mold, and applying heat and pressure
until the material is cured. Injection molding uses a closed mold, where the molding compound is injected into the
mold, maintained under pressure, and then cured by applying heat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions from composite processing occur from volatilization of a small portion of the solvent components
during curing, because the majority of these solvents are consumed in the curing reaction of the resin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nearly every aerospace manufacturing and rework operation has the potential to generate wastewater. For example,
metal finishing operations use water to rinse parts after each processing step. These rinse steps are typically carried
out in large tanks with either a continuous or intermittent water flow. The wastewater generated is usually treated
to some extent at the facility, then discharged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAP emissions from wastewater result from the evaporation of volatile components in the water. Evaporation may occur
in open trenches, storage tanks, and treatment operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Handling and Storage of Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waste is produced primarily from cleaning, coating, and depainting operations. Cleaning operations produce solvent
laden cloth and paper and spent solvent which can emit organic HAP from the evaporation of the solvents. Coating operations
produce waste paint and waste solvent thinner that also emit organic HAP through evaporation. Depainting operations
can produce either a liquid or solid waste stream depending on the type of process used. Chemical depainting processes
produce a liquid sludge that consists of the stripper solution and paint residue. Emissions occur from the evaporation
of the solvent from the stripper solution. Blast depainting processes produce a solid waste stream that consists
of paint chips and spent blasting media. Emissions do not directly occur from this waste stream, although particulate
emissions are generated during the blasting process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Storage of Hand-Wipe Cleaning Solvents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many large aerospace facilities use storage tanks for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. According to data obtained through
responses to EPA questionnaires under section 114 of the Act (section 114 questionnaires), these tanks are primarily
above ground, fixed-roof type ranging in size from 350 to 6800 gallons in size. Emissions from these tanks occur from
evaporation of the cleaning solvents, as well as breathing and working losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Control Techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal techniques used by the aerospace industry to control organic HAP emissions are preventative measures
and control devices. For the control of inorganic emissions, control devices such as filters and waterwash are used.
Preventative measures are any action, product modification, process modification, or equipment change designed
to eliminate or reduce the generation of emissions. Control devices do not prevent the generation of emissions, but
rather capture or destroy the emissions generated by a source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preventative measures are usually the most desirable method to reduce emissions since they eliminate or reduce the
actual generation of pollutants. Typically, the emission reduction is obtained using less energy and producing
less waste than using a control device to achieve the same emission reductions. Preventative measures used by the
industry are: (1) Product reformulations that replace products containing high levels of HAP and VOC with products
containing less HAP and VOC or that eliminate the HAP or VOC content completely, such as chemical strippers that contain
no organic HAP for depainting; (2) product reformulations, such as higher solids content coatings, that reduce the
amount of the HAP- and VOC-containing product used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) equipment changes that result in emission reductions, such as replacing conventional spray guns with HVLP spray
guns; and (4) work practice standards, such as housekeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control devices are typically used where product reformulation is not feasible or where the concentration of the
exhaust stream is sufficiently high to warrant their use. Control devices may destroy the HAP and VOC, as with an incinerator,
or capture the HAP and VOC, as with a carbon adsorber. Often, the compounds captured by a control device can be recovered
for reuse. Control devices in predominant use by the industry for the reduction of organic HAP emissions are: (1) Carbon
adsorbers, (2) incinerators, and (3) ultraviolet oxidation. Activated carbon fiber adsorbents to concentrate
VOC emissions are frequently used in conjunction with incinerators. For inorganic HAP particulate emissions, reduction
is achieved predominantly through the use of filtration devices.

. HAP and VOC emissions may be controlled by replacing products containing high concentrations of HAP and VOC with
ones that have reduced or eliminated HAP and VOC entirely. Each individual facility must evaluate the ability of the
new product to maintain standards of quality and performance. In addition, the potential overall environmental
benefit of the reformulated products must be carefully evaluated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waterborne coatings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Waterborne coatings utilize a resin system that is dispersible in water. A portion of the organic solvent is then replaced
with water. The organic solvent may be 5 to 40 percent by weight of the waterborne coating, compared to a conventional
organic solvent-based coating containing as much as 80 percent by weight solvent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the lower solvent content, waterborne coatings have other advantages over solvent-based coatings.
Less overspray and improved spray transfer efficiency may be achieved with waterborne coatings than with conventional
coatings that utilize solvents with a density less than that of water. Additionally, because of the reduced solvent
content, waterborne coatings may be less toxic and present a reduced fire hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterborne coatings have limitations such as requiring spray guns with specific materials of construction, protection
from freezing, and better control of temperature and humidity during application. In addition, waterborne coatings
generally require longer drying times, are more sensitive to substrate material and cleanliness, and have lower
salt spray resistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Higher solids
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Higher solids coatings are solvent-based coating formulations that have been modified to lower the solvent-to-solids
ratio. The coatings usually contain 50 to 65 percent by volume solids, compared to conventional solvent-based coatings
that may contain up to 40 percent by volume solids. The increased solids content gives greater surface area coverage
per gallon of coating, which reduces the total volume of coating required. Consequently, solvent emissions are also
reduced when higher solids coatings are used to apply the same volume of solids that are applied with a conventional
solvent-based coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Higher solids coatings generally have higher viscosities and longer drying times than conventional solvent-based
coatings. The higher viscosity tends to make spray application more difficult because it is harder to control gloss
and film thickness, and may require the coating to be heated before application. Higher solids coatings typically
are not used as dip coatings due to the difficulty in maintaining a uniform dispersion of solids in the dip tank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Powder
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Powder coatings are a class of coatings applied electrostatically in dry form and then baked to cure. The coatings
consist of fine, dry particles of paint solids. During the curing step, the particles fuse to create a continuous film.
Use of powder coatings requires that the substrate must be able to withstand the high temperatures (typically greater
than 121 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (250 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) and frequently greater than 177 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F)) necessary to cure the paint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major advantage of using powder coatings is greatly reduced solvent emissions. The lack of a solvent base also
reduces fire hazard, toxicity, and the make-up air requirements of the spray booth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Powder coatings must be applied electrostatically, so they cannot be used on non-conductive parts such as composites.
Other reported disadvantages of powder coatings are the difficulty in obtaining a high quality appearance, production
must be shut down for color changes, the powder must remain dry at all times prior to application, and higher energy
costs. As noted above, the high curing temperatures of powder coatings precludes their use on temperature-sensitive
substrates.

Self-priming topcoats
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Self-priming topcoats eliminate the need to apply a primer coat between the substrate and the topcoat. Self-priming
topcoats have the adhesion and corrosion characteristics of a conventional primer and the environmental resistance
and functional fluid resistance of a conventional topcoat. These coatings also eliminate the need for chrome-containing
primers.

Aqueous cleaners contain at least 80 percent water, are non-flammable and non-combustible, and are completely soluble
in water. Other components may include corrosion inhibitors, alkalinity builders, organic surfactants, and bioenzyme
mixtures and nutrients depending on the desired soil removal properties. Aqueous cleaners have been used in non-critical
areas where strict cleanliness requirements do not have to be met, or where there are no confined spaces that may trap
residues of the cleaner.

Non-chemical. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Several aerospace facilities have demonstrated the viability of using non-chemical methods such as dry media blasting
for cleaning operations. These methods are typically used to remove dry, scale-like deposits such as carbon residue
on engine components. Dry media blasting can usually be used only on components that can withstand the force of blasting
without deformation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equipment changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The aerospace industry has implemented several equipment changes that directly reduce the level of HAP emissions.
While there are equipment changes that affect emissions from every process, the three changes predominantly used
in the industry are high transfer efficiency spray guns, enclosed spray gun cleaners, and proportional paint mixers.
Each of these equipment changes are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
High transfer efficiency spray guns. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Emissions from spray coating operations can be reduced through the use of spraying systems with higher transfer efficiency
than conventional spray guns. Transfer efficiency, expressed as a percentage, can be defined as the ratio of coating
solids actually applied to the surface of the component being coated to the amount of solids released from the spray
gun. Spraying systems with a higher transfer efficiency can coat the same surface area using less coating. Therefore,
the HAP emissions resulting from the use of this equipment are reduced compared to applying the same coating with conventional
spray equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High volume low pressure (HVLP) and electrostatic spraying systems are the primary high efficiency spray methods
used by the industry. HVLP spray guns use high volumes (10 to 25 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm)) of low pressure
(2 to 10 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) air to deliver the paint. The lower air pressure creates a lower particle
speed, resulting in a more controlled spray pattern with less overspray and bounce back from the substrate. With electrostatic
spray systems, atomized particles of coating acquire an electric charge as they pass through a high voltage field
at the end of the spray nozzle. This electric charge causes the particles to be attracted to the parts being painted,
which are electrically grounded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enclosed spray gun cleaners. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Spray guns are typically cleaned at the end of every job, as well as between color changes. Manual cleaning of spray
guns involves disassembling the gun and placing the parts in a tray containing an appropriate cleaning solvent. The
residual paint is brushed or wiped off the parts, then the cleaning solvent is sprayed through the gun after it is reassembled.
Enclosed spray gun cleaners, however, are completely enclosed units that spray the cleaning solvent through and
over the spray gun. The enclosed unit eliminates most of the exposure of the cleaning solvent to the air, thereby greatly
reducing the organic HAP emissions from evaporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proportional paint mixers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of coatings used in the aerospace industry are multi-component mixtures, consisting of a base component
and one or more catalyst components. The components must be thoroughly mixed in the proper ratio immediately before
application. When this mixing is performed manually, a greater volume of coating is mixed than will actually be used
to ensure that there is enough coating available to complete the job. In contrast, proportional paint mixers pump
each component of the coating directly to the spray gun, where it is mixed and immediately applied. This results in
reduced coating waste and, consequently, reduced emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Work practice standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Work practice standards are changes in the method of operation that do not affect the products used in the process or
the process itself, but result in a reduction in emissions. The aerospace industry has implemented work practice
standards programs for housekeeping measures and managed chemical distribution systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions of organic HAP compounds, particularly solvents, can be reduced by limiting both the amount of the material
exposed to the atmosphere and the length of the exposure. The emission reductions can be achieved by implementing
housekeeping measures whereby solvent-soaked cloth or paper used for hand-wipe cleaning are placed into bags or
containers that are kept closed. This eliminates the continual evaporation of the solvent from the cloth or paper
when they are not in use. The bags or containers can then be collected and disposed in such a manner (e.g., by incineration)
to eliminate any further solvent emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Managed chemical distribution systems centralize the distribution of solvents and coatings and control the amount
of these materials allowed to be used for a particular task. In this way, waste solvent and coatings are reduced, and
emissions from these waste materials are reduced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carbon adsorbers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adsorption systems are used to remove organic compounds from gas streams when strict limits on the outlet concentration
must be met, or when recovery of the compound is desired. Adsorption is effective on inlet concentrations ranging
from a few parts per billion to several thousand parts per million, and a flow rate of several hundred to several hundred
thousand cubic feet per minute. Carbon adsorbers typically have a removal efficiency of 95 to 99 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the carbon reaches saturation, it can be removed from the adsorber vessel and disposed or regenerated. The carbon
can also be regenerated with steam within the adsorber vessel. This option readily allows for the recovery of the organic
compounds for recycling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incinerators. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two basic types of incinerators, thermal and catalytic, are used in the aerospace industry to remove organic contaminants.
Each type is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thermal incinerators. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thermal incinerators can be generally used on air streams with a wide concentration range of organics. These control
devices have minimal dependence on the characteristics of the organic contaminants, so they can be used to control
a wide variety of emission streams. Thermal incinerators can achieve removal efficiencies of 98 percent and higher.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic operation of thermal incinerators involves raising the inlet air stream to the incineration temperature
of the contaminants and maintaining the temperature for a specific residence time. The waste heat content of the incinerator
exhaust stream is used to preheat the inlet air stream. An auxiliary fuel is then typically required to raise the air
stream temperature to the incineration temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Catalytic incinerators. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Catalytic incinerators are similar to thermal incinerators except that they use a catalyst (a substance that accelerates
the rate of oxidation without undergoing a chemical change itself) to assist in the oxidation of organic compounds
to carbon dioxide and water. These incinerators are typically used for air streams with a low concentration of organics.
The removal efficiency of catalytic incinerators can be as high as 98 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ultraviolet oxidation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ultraviolet light oxidation (UVOX) system has been developed as an abatement device for air streams with low concentrations
of organic compounds. The air stream passes through particulate filters, then enters a reactor where it is exposed
to ultraviolet light which initiates the oxidation of the organics. Ozone and other oxygen-based oxidants are injected
into the reactor to react with the organics in the air stream to begin the oxidation of organics into carbon dioxide
and water. A typical removal efficiency for UVOX is reported to be 95 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Activated carbon fiber adsorbent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another technology has been developed to control low concentration organic compound emissions (e.g., paint spray
booths). This technology utilizes an activated carbon fiber adsorbent to initially capture the organic emissions,
the concentration of which is too low to be removed by a control device such as an incinerator. The adsorbent system
consists of a honeycomb structure element made of activated carbon fiber paper in corrugated form. This structure
adsorbs the organics in the exhaust stream. As the activated carbon structure becomes saturated, the organics are
desorbed using hot air. This concentrated air stream can then be sent to an incinerator or other control device. The
portion of the activated carbon structure that was regenerated then begins the adsorption cycle again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Catalyst-coated filter media. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Low concentration organic emissions (e.g., paint spray booths) can be controlled through the use of a catalyst-coated
filter media. The catalyst material is impregnated onto the fibers of a dry filter which can then be used wherever conventional
dry filters are used. The catalyst material, unlike activated carbon, permanently binds the organic material into
its crystalline matrix so that it will not later desorb. In addition to the coated filters, the catalyst material can
be used in a granular form to control emissions.

Filtration systems for inorganic HAP particulate emissions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Coating operations and blast depainting operations emit inorganic HAP in the form of particulates. For coating operations,
panel-type dry particulate filters and waterwash spray booths are used to control these emissions. For blast depainting
operations, panel-type dry particulate filters are also used, as well as baghouses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dry filters and baghouses capture particulates by trapping them as they try to pass through the small passages
in the filter media. The efficiency of the filter media is a function of the particle size, size of the passages in the
filter media, air flow through and pressure drop across the filter media, and physical characteristics of the particle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterwash spray booths capture particles by forcing the air stream to pass through a spray or curtain of water. The
particles are trapped by the water and eventually collect as a sludge in the sump of the spray booth.

V. Rationale for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Regulatory Development Process for NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During development of a NESHAP, the EPA collects information about the industry, including information on emission
source characteristics, control technologies, data from HAP emission tests at well-controlled facilities, and
information on the cost, energy, and other environmental impacts of emission control techniques. The EPA uses this
information in the development of possible regulatory approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the source category contains major sources, then a MACT standard is required. Section 112(d)(3) of the Act defines
the minimum stringency requirements of the MACT standard for new and existing sources. This level of control is referred
to as the MACT ``floor,'' which needs to be determined as a starting point for developing the regulatory alternatives.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the floor has been determined for new and existing sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator must
set MACT standards that are no less stringent than the floor level. Such standards must then be met by all sources within
the category or subcategory. However, in establishing standards, the Administrator may distinguish among classes,
types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory (section 112(d)(1) of the Act). Thus, for example, the
Administrator could establish two classes of sources within a category or subcategory based on size and establish
a different emission standard for each class as long as each standard is at least as stringent as the floor. The Act also
contains provisions for regulating area sources. However, except for certain recordkeeping requirements contained
in the General Provisions, these are not relevant to the proposed standards for aerospace sources, which apply only
to major sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in establishing a MACT standard is the development and analysis of regulatory alternatives. First,
information about the industry is analyzed to develop model plant populations for projecting national impacts,
including HAP emission reduction levels, costs, and energy and secondary environmental impacts. Several regulatory
alternatives (which may be different levels of emission control, different applicability criteria, or both, and
one of which is the MACT floor) are then evaluated to determine the most appropriate regulatory alternative to reflect
the MACT level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, although NESHAP are normally structured in terms of numerical emission limits, alternative approaches
are sometimes necessary. Section 112(h) of the Act provides that if it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission
standard, then a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard may be established. For example, in some
cases source testing may be impossible or at least not practicable due to technological and economic limitations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the EPA's decision-making process, the regulatory alternatives considered for new versus existing sources may
be different and each alternative must be technically achievable. In selecting a regulatory alternative to represent
MACT, the EPA considers the achievable reduction in HAP emissions (and possibly other pollutants that are co-controlled),
the cost of control, and economic, energy, and other nonair quality health and environmental impacts. The overall
objective is the achievement of the maximum degree of emission reduction without unreasonable economic or other
impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selected regulatory alternative is then translated into a proposed regulation. The regulation implementing
the MACT decision typically includes sections addressing applicability, standards, test methods and compliance
demonstration, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The preamble to the proposed regulation, published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provides an explanation of the rationale for the decision. The public is invited to comment on the proposed regulation
during the public comment period. Following an evaluation of these comments, the EPA reaches a decision and promulgates
the final standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

B. Determining Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) ``Floors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the EPA has identified the specific major source categories or subcategories that it intends to regulate under
section 112, MACT standards are set at a level at least as stringent as the ``floor.'' Congress has provided directives
to guide the EPA in the process of determining the regulatory floor.

Congress specified that the EPA must establish standards which require ``the maximum degree of reduction in emissions
of the hazardous air pollutants *&blank;*&blank;* that the Administrator *&blank;*&blank;* determines is achievable
*&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 112(d)(2) of the Act). In addition, Congress limited the Agency's discretion by defining
the minimum baseline (floor) at which standards may be set, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For new sources, the standards for a source category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than the emission
control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator,''
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For existing sources, the standards ``may be less stringent than standards for new sources *&blank;*&blank;*
but shall not be less stringent, and may be more stringent than: (A) the average emission limitation achieved by the
best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information) *&blank;*&blank;*
or (B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources *&blank;*&blank;* for categories
or subcategories *&blank;*&blank;* with fewer than 30 sources'' (section 112(d)(3)of the Act).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(b) of the Act lists the HAP to be regulated with standards established under section 112. Section 112(d),
as amended, requires the EPA to promulgate emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources and
area sources of the HAP listed in section 112(b). For the purpose of developing these standards, the EPA may distinguish
among classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory. The NESHAP are to be developed to control
HAP emissions from both new and existing sources pursuant to section 112(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial source category list (57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992), required by section 112(c) of the Act, identifies source
categories for which NESHAP are to be established. This list includes all major source categories of HAP known to the
EPA at this time, and all area source categories for which a finding of adverse effects warranting regulation has been
made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source category list identifies ``surface coating processes_aerospace industries'' as a source category because
it contains major sources emitting at least 10 tons of any one HAP or more than 25 tons of any combination of HAP annually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aerospace industry encompasses original equipment manufacturers of commercial, civil, and military (including
space) aerospace vehicles. In addition, rework facilities, which repair and repaint aerospace vehicles, constitute
a major portion of the industry. There are also many subcontractors providing support to the industry, especially
to the OEM's, who subcontract out various portions of the work. These subcontractors may engage in many of the processes
found at OEM or rework facilities, or in just a few. Further, subcontractors may conduct operations for non-aerospace
industries at facilities at which they conduct aerospace operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this rule, the EPA has defined the source category as consisting of all facilities engaged in the
manufacture or rework of any aerospace vehicle or component. This includes all OEM's, rework facilities, and subcontractors.
The EPA decided to include subcontractors in the proposed rule because they perform substantial amounts of work,
much of which could otherwise be carried out at an OEM or rework facility and which is virtually indistinguishable
from processes at the OEM or rework facility. However, if the subcontractors' facilities are not major sources, they
would not be subject to the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early in the development of the proposed standards, the EPA developed model plants to correspond to the basic structure
of the industry_commercial and military segments, each having OEM and rework facilities_with the intent of developing
subcategories for standards development, if necessary. On the basis of the information provided, however, the EPA
has found that, with one exception for depainting operations, there is no need to distinguish among these segments
for the processes for which standards are being proposed under the proposed rule.

D. Selection of Emission Points Covered by the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would limit organic HAP emissions from the following basic aerospace operations: cleaning, primer
application, topcoat application, depainting, chemical milling maskant application, and the handling and storage
of waste. The proposed rule would apply to all organic HAP emission points within these operations located within
aerospace manufacturing or rework facilities that are major sources. In addition, the proposed rule would require
control of emissions from these operations if they are performed in any of the operations for which standards are not
being proposed. For example, hand-wipe cleaning operations are performed at several stages within composite processing
operations. The hand-wipe cleaning operation, a process covered by the proposed standard, would be subject to the
standard, regardless of where in the facility it occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards are being proposed for inorganic HAP emissions from primer application, topcoat application, and depainting
operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A discussion of the rationale for including or excluding in this proposed rule the basic processes listed in Section
V.A. is presented below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operations for Which Standards Are Being Proposed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Organic HAP emissions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the EPA is proposing organic HAP emission standards for cleaning, primer application, topcoat application,
depainting, and chemical milling maskant application, and the handling and storage of waste. Together, these operations
are estimated to account for approximately 94 percent of the organic HAP emissions from the industry_cleaning, 87.5
percent; primers and topcoats, 2.1 percent; depainting, 2.6 percent; and chemical milling maskants, 1.5 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information obtained from the section 114 questionnaires and meetings with the industry, there are many
readily available techniques to achieve substantial emission reductions in each of these operations. For example,
many chemical milling maskant operations were reported as using either solvent-based chemical milling maskants
with control devices or waterborne chemical milling maskants. With regard to cleaning operations, many product
reformulations are available for hand-wipe cleaning, and there are several equipment and work practice standards
for spray gun cleaning that reduce organic HAP emissions. While methylene chloride chemical stripping is the prevalent
method for depainting aerospace vehicles, many facilities are using non-HAP alternatives. These alternatives
are being used by both commercial and military facilities to reduce emissions from depainting operations. Sufficient
data exist for establishing MACT based on non-HAP alternatives for both commercial and military depainting operations.
Therefore, these processes are included in the proposed rule. Section 114 questionnaire data and the existence of
State and local regulations identify the use of high transfer efficiency spray guns in the aerospace industry. Adequate
information exists for establishing MACT for the method of application of primers and topcoats and for limiting the
organic HAP content of the coatings. Based on section 114 questionnaire data, nearly all facilities employ housekeeping
measures to control emissions from waste storage. Sufficient data exist, therefore, to establish MACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, based upon their relative contribution to overall organic HAP emissions and the use of demonstrated emission
control technologies and techniques to achieve emission reduction, the EPA selected these operations for regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inorganic HAP emissions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing inorganic HAP emission standards for primer application, topcoat application, and depainting
operations. Based on section 114 questionnaire responses, there are readily available techniques that are used
extensively in the industry to control these emissions. While the inorganic HAP emissions do not represent a large
percentage of overall emissions from the industry, the emissions represent potential threats to health because
of the highly toxic nature of the inorganic HAP (e.g., chromium and cadmium). For these reasons, the EPA selected these
operations for regulation.

2. Excluded Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is not proposing standards for four non-coating related operations_chemical milling, metal finishing,
electrodeposition, and composite processing_and for four coating-related operations_adhesives, adhesive bonding
primers, sealants, and specialty coatings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic HAP emissions were reported from all four of the non-coating related processes. Emissions from these four
operations account for less than 1 percent of the total organic HAP emissions from aerospace facilities. Most of the
organic HAP emissions from these operations are due to emissions from the use of cleaning solvents, which are being
proposed for regulation under the proposed rule. The EPA has determined that requiring control of the remaining organic
HAP emissions is not feasible because no demonstrated control measures could be identified. Therefore, the EPA is
proposing no further control for organic HAP emissions from these four operations other than what would be achieved
by the proposed standards for cleaning solvents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four coating-related operations_adhesives, adhesive bonding primers, sealants, and specialty coatings_are
similar in many ways to primers and topcoats, for which organic HAP emission standards are being proposed. These four
coating-related operations account for relatively small amounts of organic HAP emissions, and the coatings tend
to be very specialized. Subcategorization can be significant, especially for specialty coatings, resulting in
lower potential emission reductions. Many of the coatings in these four operations (e.g., sealants and adhesives)
are already being applied using high transfer techniques, including hand application. This results in little opportunity
for emission reduction through improved transfer efficiency. For spray applied sealants, there is also little opportunity
to use higher transfer efficiency equipment because the viscosity of these sealants requires the use of high pressure,
conventional spray guns. In terms of potential emission reduction from lower organic HAP content coatings, virtually
no organic HAP content data were available to categorize these coatings. The time necessary to gather the data would
have significantly delayed this proposed rule. For all of these reasons, standards are not being proposed for these
operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastewater and storage tanks emit relatively small amounts of HAP and, according to the section 114 questionnaire
responses, no aerospace facilities used any means to control these emissions. The EPA then considered the option
of requiring applicable controls used in other industries on these types of sources. These control measures were
evaluated and found to be too costly when compared to the emission reductions that would be achieved (approximately
$126,000 per ton of HAP emissions reduction for storage tanks).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other requirements in the standards may result in a direct reduction of emissions from wastewater and storage tanks.
For example, the depainting standards may eliminate the majority of the estimated 152 million gallons of HAP-containing
chemical stripper usage if the majority of sources use media blasting methods. This stripper is typically treated
in wastewater treatment systems after use. Also, the hand-wipe cleaning standards will virtually eliminate the
storage tanks for organic HAP-containing solvents since the use of these solvents will be significantly reduced.
For these reasons, the EPA is not proposing to regulate HAP emissions from wastewater and storage tanks in the proposed
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Selection of the Basis for the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Act defines a major source as any stationary source that emits 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tpy) or more of any one
HAP or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more of total HAP. The Act states that new major sources must achieve the maximum achievable
control technology (MACT), which is the level of emission control already achieved in practice by the best controlled
similar source. The Act further states that emission standards promulgated for existing sources may be less stringent
than standards for new sources; however, standards for existing sources must not be less stringent than the average
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all operations being covered by the proposed rule, the EPA has determined that, taking into account cost, nonair
quality health and environmental impacts, and energy impacts, MACT is equal to the MACT floors for both existing and
new sources. In addition, MACT for new sources was found to be equal to MACT for existing sources. The EPA has determined
that no further emission reductions can be achieved for new sources through the use of demonstrated technology than
the level of reduction represented by MACT for existing sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To evaluate the regulatory alternatives, model plants were developed based on market segment (commercial or military),
work type (OEM or rework), and size (small, medium, or large). These characteristics were examined to determine whether
any technological justification existed to differentiate the proposed standards by market segment, work type,
or size. Based on this examination, the EPA has determined that, other than one exception under the depainting standards,
there is no justification for differentiating between these characteristics. For example, rework facilities are
required to conform to OEM specifications, which dictate the processes and coatings that can be used. Consequently,
rework facilities do not typically incorporate technology that is not used by the OEM's. Also, no compelling reasons
were identified as to why a facility of one size could not incorporate the technology used by a facility of another size.

1. Cleaning Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to data obtained from the Bureau of the Census, approximately 25 percent of facilities with aerospace manufacturing
SIC codes are located in California. Based on information provided by four California districts_SCAQMD, Imperial
County Air Pollution Control District (APCD), Ventura County APCD, and San Diego APCD_virtually all of the California
facilities are located in these districts, and more than half are located in the SCAQMD alone. Based on this information,
more than 12 percent of the total number of sources are, then, subject to the rules in these four districts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the regulations in these four districts (i.e., SCAQMD Rule 1124, Imperial County APCD Rule 425, Ventura
County APCD Rule 74.13, and San Diego APCD Rule 67.9) were examined to determine the emission limitations in these
districts. These regulations specify vapor pressure limits and housekeeping measures for hand-wipe cleaning solvents.
The EPA then investigated to determine if the regulations resulted in California facilities emitting less HAP from
this process than facilities outside of California. Based on the section 114 questionnaire responses, California
facilities emitted approximately 48 percent less HAP than non-California facilities in ozone nonattainment areas
for hand-wipe cleaning operations. These emissions were calculated on a pounds of HAP emitted per employee basis,
using the total number of employees at the facilities (the number of employees for hand-wipe cleaning only was not
available). The conclusion made from these data was that the California regulations are an effective means of producing
permanent and quantifiable emission reductions, and that the sources subject to these regulations are the best-performing
sources in this source category. Since these sources also comprise more than 12 percent of the sources in the category,
the MACT floor was based on their control levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was impossible to distinguish the separate effects of housekeeping and vapor pressure limits on the emission rates
from hand-wipe cleaning operations. Consequently, both were assumed to be necessary to achieve the calculated emission
reductions. While one cannot ``average'' housekeeping measures, based on common aspects among the four rules, housekeeping
measures of maintaining closed containers for the storage of fresh solvent, spent solvent, and solvent-soaked cloth
and paper were established as one part of the MACT floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second part of the MACT floor for hand-wipe cleaning is a vapor pressure limitation on the solvents being used.
The SCAQMD, the San Diego AQMD, and the Imperial County APCD specify a maximum vapor pressure of 45 mm Hg at 20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. Ventura County APCD specifies 25 mm Hg at 20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. However, the EPA believes that it is inappropriate to give equal weight to the Ventura rule in determining
the MACT floor because this district contains only three aerospace facilities compared to the hundreds located in
the South Coast and San Diego districts. Furthermore, industry comments suggested that these three facilities are
not representative of the industry and do not constitute a similar source as required by the Act. The EPA did, however,
consider a weighted average vapor pressure limitation, but the vapor pressure value obtained did not correspond
to any demonstrated technology. Since more than half, and possibly as much as 90 percent, of the aerospace facilities
in California are located in the South Coast district, the EPA has determined that the 45 mm Hg vapor pressure is more
representative of the ``average'' limitation on cleaning solvents among the best performing facilities and represents
the MACT floor for both new and existing sources. More stringent levels (e.g., a weighted average vapor pressure value)
were not considered to be achievable by all sources. Therefore, the EPA has selected the 45 mm Hg at 20

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information collected on cleaning solvents also showed that some hand-wipe cleaning solvents have both a very low
vapor pressure and a very low evaporation rate. Available data indicate that low evaporation rates also contribute
to minimizing emissions. These cleaning solvents are demonstrated technology for limited applications and their
use would reduce organic HAP emissions as much as or more than the proposed vapor pressure limit. Therefore, the EPA
is proposing to encourage their use by including an approved composition list for cleaning solvents in the proposed
rule. The EPA welcomes comments on this list and proposals for adding to the list before final promulgation of the rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data provided by aerospace facilities in response to the section 114 questionnaires, spray guns used to apply
coatings are cleaned either manually or in enclosed gun cleaners. Based on information obtained during plant visits,
enclosed gun cleaners are demonstrated to reduce emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the 61 facilities that reported a spray gun cleaning method was classified as to whether the spray guns were
cleaned manually or with an enclosed cleaner. Eighteen of the 61 facilities (29 percent) reported using enclosed
gun cleaners; therefore, enclosed gun cleaners were considered to represent the MACT floor level of control. The
EPA also received information from the industry on the use of cleaning methods other than enclosed gun cleaners. After
review of this information, the EPA determined that adequate technical justification was presented to show that
the alternate cleaning methods were as effective as enclosed spray gun cleaners in controlling organic HAP emissions.
Consequently, in addition to enclosed spray gun cleaners, the EPA is proposing to allow the use of: (1) Unatomized
discharge of solvent into a waste container that is kept closed when not in use, (2) hand cleaning in a vat that is kept
closed when not in use, and (3) the use of atomized spray into a waste container fitted with a device designed to capture
atomized solvent emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information received from the responses to the section 114 questionnaires, plant visits, and industry meetings,
the EPA learned that there are certain cleaning operations for which low VOC, low HAP, or low vapor pressure cleaning
solvents do not have widespread use that would constitute a demonstrated technology. The EPA, therefore, is proposing
to exempt these cleaning operations from the requirements to use cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition
list and the proposed vapor pressure limit of 45 mm Hg at 20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

&cir;F). These operations are listed in &sect;63.744(e) of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list is not yet demonstrated for the proposed
exempt cleaning operations. However, there are many new cleaning solvents being developed, some of which are very
close to being used within the industry for some of these proposed exempt cleaning operations. To encourage the use
of available compliant cleaning solvents and the ones being developed, the EPA considered imposing a limit on the
annual usage of non-compliant cleaning solvents for exempt operations. However, no data were available for use in
establishing this limit.

2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, over 12 percent of the aerospace industry is located in four districts in California. The SCAQMD, Ventura
County APCD, Imperial County APCD, and Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD rules all require high transfer efficiency
coating application methods. The application methods specified in these rules were adopted as the MACT floor. The
specified methods are electrostatic application, flow coat application, dip coat application, roll coating, brush
coating, and HVLP spraying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA recognizes that there may be other application methods that achieve a level of emissions equivalent to the
application methods allowed in the proposed rule. Therefore, the EPA is requesting comments identifying these other
application methods. These comments should include test data demonstrating that, in actual production conditions,
the application method achieves a level of emissions at least equivalent to the level of emissions achieved by HVLP
or electrostatic spray application methods. The EPA will review these comments and, where adequate technical justification
exists, amend the list of approved application methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also examined whether or not there are demonstrated low organic HAP content primers or topcoats that could
be used in conjunction with high transfer application methods to establish the MACT floor to reduce emissions. To
this end, the EPA examined State and local regulations and the data obtained through the section 114 responses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local regulations for aerospace coatings use VOC content as the means of regulating coating emissions.
Consequently, no directed effort has been made to control the organic HAP content of these coatings. Data on coating
VOC content are readily available from both the coating manufacturers and the coating users, but no comprehensive
data exist for coating organic HAP content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data obtained from the section 114 responses showed that the organic HAP content varies widely and randomly with
the VOC content. This is not surprising since, as noted above, there have been efforts to limit only the VOC content
in the coatings and not the organic HAP content. However, the data show that the organic HAP content is typically 50
percent less than the VOC content. Where the organic HAP content was higher than the VOC content, the EPA found that
this was the result of the use of exempt solvents (those solvents determined by the EPA to have negligible photochemical
reactivity) that are also organic HAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of chemicals commonly found in coatings that are not on the list of 189 HAP (section 112(b) of the Act)
including methyl amylketone (2-heptanone), cyclohexanone, and isopropyl alcohol. Currently, the EPA does not
have adequate health data to determine the relative toxicity of these organic HAP substitutes and, therefore, does
not want to establish a requirement that would encourage their use as substitutes in coatings. Since these potential
substitutes are also VOC, the proposed standards would limit both organic HAP and VOC content, rather than organic
HAP only. The effect of this dual limit will be to reduce the total amount of organic emissions from coating operations,
eliminate the use of the few very high organic HAP content primers and topcoats, and establish a cap on the organic HAP
content of primers and topcoats that will be developed in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organic HAP and VOC limits were determined by ranking the facilities that reported usage of primers or topcoats
from the lowest to the highest weighted average VOC content of all primers or topcoats used at the facility. The weighted
average VOC content that represented the average of the best 12 percent was selected as the VOC limit. This value was
350 g/l (2.9 lb/gal) for primers and 420 g/l (3.5 lb/gal) for topcoats. As discussed earlier, the limited data available
to the EPA indicate that organic HAP content is typically lower than VOC content. However, no reasonable limit could
be identified. Therefore, the EPA is proposing an organic HAP content limit at the same level as for VOC. The proposed
limits for organic HAP are, therefore, 350 g/l (2.9 lb/gal) for primers and 420 g/l (3.5 lb/gal) for topcoats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 114 questionnaire responses showed that the inorganic HAP emissions from nearly all primer and topcoat
application operations were controlled by dry particulate filters or waterwash spray booths. Since no other technology
was identified that can be used to control inorganic HAP emissions, the use of filters and waterwash was adopted as
the MACT floor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information obtained on depainting operations showed the pervasive use of organic HAP-containing chemical
strippers to remove paint. However, information was also obtained showing that many aerospace depainting operations
are using alternative methods that do not utilize organic HAP, including organic HAP-free chemical strippers and
dry media blasting techniques. The information also showed that not all commercial aerospace vehicles are fully
coated. In these instances, the amount of organic HAP emissions from depainting is less than it would be if the same
vehicle were fully coated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quantity of organic HAP emissions from depainting operations at several commercial rework facilities was readily
available. However, very limited emissions data were obtained through the section 114 questionnaire responses
for military aircraft depainting operations. The EPA considered several parameters to establish which facilities
were the best performing ones. The most simple method would be to determine the pounds of organic HAP emissions per
aircraft. This would not, however, take into account the difference in outer surface area from one model of aircraft
to another and, hence, the difference in stripper volume required for each aircraft. Another basis would be to determine
the organic HAP emissions per square foot of outer surface area actually painted. This method would not distinguish
between the total emissions for stripping an aircraft that has only a portion of the outer surface area painted, and
the total emissions for stripping the same aircraft with the entire outer surface area painted. Therefore, both methods
were rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another basis for determining the best performing operations relates the pounds of organic HAP emissions to the total
outer surface area of the aircraft. This effectively takes into account the effectiveness of all methods used to depaint
aerospace vehicles and distinguishes the lower emissions achieved when only a portion of the outer surface area is
painted from the emissions when a larger portion is painted. However, insufficient data were obtained through the
section 114 questionnaire responses to develop an emission rate for military aircraft depainting operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth consideration was to identify the basic techniques being used and rank them according to their relative effectiveness
in reducing organic HAP emissions. The EPA elected to use this as the measure for identifying the best performing facilities.
The different depainting techniques were also evaluated as to their applicability throughout the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three basic depainting techniques are used by the facilities for which the EPA has information: Methylene chloride
based chemical strippers, chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP, and blasting methods. (Although blasting
methods are very effective in reducing and essentially eliminating organic HAP emissions from depainting operations,
they do produce particulate inorganic HAP emissions. However, these emissions are typically well-controlled with
particulate filters, which are almost always integral to the blasting systems. In addition, the proposed standards
would require such control on inorganic HAP emissions, as discussed in section II.B. of this preamble.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on section 114 questionnaires, site visits, and information provided by the industry, the EPA has information
on depainting methods at 20 facilities. Of these facilities, 14 were identified as using either a blasting method
(i.e., wheat starch or plastic media) or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then determined the aircraft models being stripped at each of these 14 facilities. This analysis showed that
military fighters and transports, military and commercial helicopters, civil aircraft, and nearly all models of
commercial airliners are currently being stripped with one or more of these non-HAP methods. Given the wide applicability
of these processes throughout the industry, the EPA determined the MACT floor to be equivalent to the use of either
media blasting or chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis also showed, however, that some organic HAP emissions from depainting still occurred at facilities
using blast methods or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. This is due to the fact that certain parts (e.g.,
wing flaps, engine nacelles, and radomes) are removed from the aircraft and depainted separately. This is primarily
due to the fragile nature or specific depainting needs of these parts. Due to the wide range of parts removed and the
inconsistency in the type of parts removed from one model of aircraft to another, the applicability of using blast
techniques or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP on these parts could not be determined. Consequently,
these parts are exempted from the proposed standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the EPA determined that a small portion of the aircraft cannot be stripped with blasting methods. For
example, some areas of the aircraft are masked to prevent intrusion of the blast media. The edge of the masking will
often cover coated areas and, thus, prevent the blasting media from removing the coating from these areas. This coating
must then be removed (referred to as spot stripping), usually with an organic HAP-containing chemical stripper.
Another example of spot stripping is the removal of coatings from a small area of the outer surface of the aircraft in
order to perform testing and inspection of the bare metal. Also, blasting methods may have difficulty removing some
decals. Consequently, organic HAP solvents may be used to soften or remove these decals. For these reasons, exemptions
for spot stripping and decal removal are necessary in order to allow the use of blast depainting methods to meet the
proposed standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA did, however, seek to limit the amount of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used for radome, parts
and spot stripping and decal removal. Data provided in the section 114 questionnaire responses were used to establish
the amount of stripper used for these operations. Data were not available for radome and parts depainting; however,
usage of chemical strippers for spot stripping and decal removal was available from commercial airlines for a limited
number of aircraft types. Since information was not available for all aircraft types, the stripper usage for the largest
commercial aircraft was used as the basis for the usage exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The usage information was, however, limited to commercial aircraft. Military sources within the aerospace industry
provided additional data to the EPA that established a technical justification for a higher usage limitation for
military aircraft. This information was used as the basis for the usage limitation for spot stripping and decal removal
for military aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 114 questionnaire responses showed that all facilities (7 respondents) that use media blasting to depaint
use either dry particulate filters or baghouses to control particulate emissions from blast depainting methods.
While electrostatic precipitators were identified as a possible control technology, the cost of the precipitators
was believed to be considerably higher than the filtration methods already in use. Therefore, particulate filters
and baghouses were used as the basis for developing the MACT floor for operations that use media blasting.

4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not all aerospace facilities perform chemical milling maskant operations. Of those responding to the section 114
request, twelve reported chemical milling operations. To identify the best performing twelve percent of the sources,
the emission rate for each source was calculated by dividing the organic HAP emissions by the total usage of chemical
milling maskants to obtain pounds of organic HAP emitted per gallon of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied.
The emissions value took into account control measures such as carbon adsorbers or waterborne chemical milling maskants.
The sources were then ranked from the lowest emission rate to the highest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this operation, the best performing 12 percent of the sources is represented by the two sources with the lowest
emission rates. One of these sources utilized a carbon adsorber to abate the emissions from a solvent-based chemical
milling maskant. The other source utilized a waterborne chemical milling maskant with no abatement. Each of these
two facilities had the same organic HAP emission rate of 1.3 lb/gal. Therefore, this was selected to represent the
MACT floor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the section 114 questionnaire responses, 181 non-wastewater waste streams were reported. Every stream
was controlled by housekeeping measures such as keeping the waste material in closed drums. Thus, housekeeping measures
were established as the MACT floor for handling and storage of waste.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While no data were available for the effect on emissions from the housekeeping measures, it is expected that emissions
will be reduced based on the data from California facilities for keeping cleaning solvents in closed containers.
Consequently, housekeeping measures were used as the basis for the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, existing RCRA regulations govern handling and storage practices for certain types of wastes. Since
the EPA did not want to create a situation where possible conflicts with the RCRA regulations could arise, the proposed
rule exempts wastes covered under the RCRA regulations.

F. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several formats could be used to implement the control techniques selected as the basis for the proposed standards.
Section 112(d) of the Act requires that emission standards for control of HAP be prescribed unless, in the judgment
of the Administrator, it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce emission standards. Section 112(h) of the Act defines
two conditions under which it is not feasible to prescribe or to enforce emission standards. These conditions are:
(1) If the HAP cannot be emitted through a conveyance device or (2) if the application of measurement methodology to
a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological or economic limitations. If emission standards
are not feasible to prescribe or enforce, then the Administrator may instead promulgate equipment, work practice,
design or operational standards, or a combination thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Cleaning Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cleaning operation for which the EPA is proposing standards emits a variety of organic HAP. For many of these organic
HAP, emission measurement methods either do not exist or would be very expensive to implement. In addition, the nature
of some cleaning operations (e.g., hand-wipe cleaning) makes collection through a conveyance device difficult
if not impossible. Therefore, the EPA determined that emission standards are not feasible for these operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then considered design, equipment, work practice, and operational standards for these operations. The EPA
examined the California regulations, which had been determined to represent the floor level of control, to identify
the specific types of measures adopted for hand-wipe cleaning, flush cleaning, and spray gun cleaning. An analysis
by the EPA of the aerospace facilities' data showed that facilities subject to the California requirements emitted
approximately 48 percent less organic HAP from their operations than non-California operations in ozone nonattainment
areas. The EPA concluded that the formats of the California regulations are effective in providing quantifiable
and achievable emission reductions. Therefore, the same formats are being proposed for the NESHAP as follows: (1)
For hand-wipe cleaning operations, use of solvents that conform to the approved composition list or vapor pressure
limits, and housekeeping measures, (2) for spray gun cleaning, an equipment standard and housekeeping measures,
and (3) for flush cleaning, housekeeping measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also proposing standards to limit the organic HAP emissions that may occur from leaks from enclosed spray
gun cleaners. A format based on emission limits was not possible, since there were no data to determine the emissions
from leaks. Also, no design, equipment, or work practice standards were identified that would prevent leaks from
occurring. Consequently, the EPA determined that the only format that would ensure a minimum of organic HAP emissions
from leaks was an operational standard that required leaks to be repaired within a certain amount of time.

2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The formats selected by the EPA for the proposed organic HAP emission limits for primer and topcoat application operations
are: (1) A limitation on both the VOC and organic HAP content, (2) a percent reduction and performance standard for
control devices, and (3) an equipment standard for the application of primers and topcoats.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA considered a format based on actual emissions from the primer and topcoat application operations. However,
the EPA has information that many larger facilities have several hundred spray booths in which primer or topcoat application
operations could take place. Monitoring of that many individual emission sources would not be feasible for either
the facility or for enforcement of the standards by the EPA or state agencies. In addition, actual emissions would
have to be linked to the production rate and the product produced at the facility. The EPA does not have adequate data
to quantify emissions based on production or the product produced. Therefore, the EPA rejected this format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then considered a limitation on the organic HAP and VOC content (mass of organic HAP and VOC per unit volume)
of coating as applied. This format would essentially impose an emission limitation on each source, but allow flexibility
in the manner of compliance. Each source would have the choice of using compliant coatings and averaging between compliant
and non-compliant coatings. This format will reduce the amount of total organics, is easily enforced with Method
24 for VOC content and manufacturer's data for organic HAP content, and will cap the total amount of organic HAP that
a primer or topcoat can contain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also allowing the use of control devices to reduce organic HAP and VOC emissions from primer and topcoat application
operations. The format of the standards must ensure that as much of the emissions as practicable are being controlled.
The EPA chose a format that specifies the overall control efficiency (capture efficiency multiplied by the removal
efficiency) because overall control efficiency is the best representation of the control effectiveness of control
devices. It is also easily enforceable since the EPA has published test methods for both capture and removal efficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to set an equipment standard to reduce HAP emissions from the application of primers and topcoats.
This format requires the use of certain specified coating application equipment or coating methods that result in
higher transfer efficiencies than conventional spray equipment, thus reducing emissions. This format allows facilities
the flexibility to choose the method of application most appropriate to the coating and substrate being coated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA first considered the data presented in the section 114 questionnaire responses to determine the format of
the standards for inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats. The level of control (expressed as a percentage)
of dry particulate filters and waterwash spray booths was reported in the section 114 questionnaire responses. However,
the basis for the reported control efficiency was primarily engineering judgement and manufacturer's data, which
could not be verified through standardized testing. While the Act specifies that emission standards be developed
whenever possible, the EPA determined that the available data were not of sufficient quality to develop such a standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then considered an equipment standard that described physical characteristics of high efficiency particulate
filters and waterwash systems. However, due to the number of different filter and waterwash systems and variety of
designs available, no concise description could be developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then developed a format that specified that all primer and topcoat application operations must be conducted
in a ventilated booth or hangar equipped with filters or waterwash systems. The selection of the actual filters and
waterwash systems would be left to the individual facilities.

3. Depainting Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The demonstrated technologies for depainting that represent the best performing 12 percent of sources are blast
methods (e.g., plastic media and wheat starch blasting) and chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA
considered an operational format for the proposed standards that would require one of these methods to be used. However,
many other alternative depainting methods are under development that have the potential to reduce organic HAP emissions
as effectively as blasting or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA did not want to limit the development
of these alternative depainting methods, so the operational format was rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then considered the level of organic HAP emissions from blasting, chemical strippers that contain no organic
HAP, and other alternative depainting methods. With the exception of spot, decal, radome, and parts depainting,
all of these methods have the potential to emit no organic HAP. The EPA, therefore, chose an emission standard format
that specifies no organic HAP emissions from depainting, with exemptions for spot, decal, radome, and parts depainting.
This format would allow the currently demonstrated depainting methods, as well as alternative methods that may be
developed in the future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While spot stripping and decal removal have been exempted from the proposed standards, the EPA, in selecting the format
of the exemption, intends to limit the use of organic HAP-containing stripper to the lowest amount necessary. The
EPA selected a limitation on the annual average amount (in gallons) of organic HAP-containing stripper used per aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format for the proposed standards for inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations was developed from
the section 114 questionnaire responses. The seven facilities that reported blast depainting operations were ranked
according to control efficiency of the filtration methods (particulate filters or baghouses) used to control particulate
emissions. The best performing 12 percent of these sources are represented by the one facility with the highest control
efficiency. This facility achieved a reported control efficiency of 99 percent and was chosen to represent the MACT
floor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control efficiency data reported in the section 114 questionnaire responses consisted of engineering judgement
estimates and information obtained from the filter manufacturers. No test data were reported. Due to this lack of
quantifiable test data, the EPA is requesting comments on whether the 99 percent level of control represents the demonstrated
level of technology for the control of particulate emissions from blast depainting. These comments should contain
a technical justification, including test data where possible, for any recommended level of control.

4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An emission limitation based on the mass of organic HAP and VOC per unit volume applied was selected for chemical milling
maskants. There are essentially two means of complying with the proposed standards: (1) Solvent-based chemical
milling maskant with a carbon adsorber to reduce emissions or (2) a waterborne chemical milling maskant with an organic
HAP content equal to or less than the proposed standard. This format allows facilities to choose either method (or
develop an equivalent method) without giving preference to either solvent-based or waterborne chemical milling
maskants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for the format of the proposed standards for handling and storage of waste is essentially the same as
that for housekeeping measures for cleaning solvents. Since no data were available to establish an emission limitation
and control equipment was not technically feasible, a work practice format requiring housekeeping measures was
selected as the most appropriate means of reducing emissions.

Cleaning operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For hand-wipe cleaning, the proposed standards would allow owners or operators to use either a cleaning solvent that
conforms to an approved composition list or a cleaning solvent with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 45 mm Hg. Procedures
are, therefore, necessary for determining whether a cleaning solvent conforms to the approved composition list
or meets the vapor pressure limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other portion of the proposed standards for cleaning operations (including spray gun cleaning) includes housekeeping
measures, equipment standards, or work practice standards, for which no test methods or procedures are required
to demonstrate compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those facilities that use cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list would have to demonstrate
how the solvents comply. The EPA is proposing that data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent be used
to show compliance. The data must show all components of the cleaning solvent and demonstrate that one of the approved
composition definitions is met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the composite vapor pressure of a cleaning solvent, the EPA is proposing that for single-component cleaning
solvents data supplied by the manufacturer or from standard engineering reference texts be used. This information
is readily available and, for single component cleaning solvents, should be readily acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For multi-component cleaning solvents, it is necessary to determine the composite vapor pressure of the cleaning
solvent. This requires determining the amount of each organic compound in the cleaning solvent and each one's vapor
pressure. Once these are known, then a procedure to combine the information must be followed to calculate the composite
vapor pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing that gas chromatographic analysis, following the procedures outlined in E 260&hyph;85, be used
to quantify the amount of each organic compound. The vapor pressure of each organic compound would then be determined,
again, either by the manufacturer's data or from standard engineering reference texts, as discussed above. For combining
these data to calculate the composite vapor pressure, the EPA is proposing that the blend be assumed to be an ideal solution
where Raoult's law applies. While more accurate methods are available, the cost and time to conduct those methods
and the small gain in accuracy are not justifiable when compared to the ease of calculating composite vapor pressure
assuming an ideal solution where Raoult's law applies. Further, the composite vapor pressure of any blend changes
with the conditions under which it is applied. This normal variability would cause some cleaning solvents to meet
the composite vapor limit under certain conditions, but not others, if the vapor pressure test methods were used instead
of the calculation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As long as this equipment is installed, operated, and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications, it
should perform with high transfer efficiency. Therefore, the EPA is not proposing any test methods or procedures
for this part of the primer and topcoat standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators who want to use application equipment other than that specified in the proposed rule must demonstrate
that it is equivalent in reducing organic HAP and VOC emissions. To make an equivalency determination, the owner or
operator must demonstrate that the organic HAP and VOC emissions generated by the alternative method are equal to
or less than the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray guns under the actual production conditions in
which the alternative method is intended to be used. This level of emissions is equivalent to the emissions demonstrated
by California facilities that are subject to similar rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before implementing the alternative application method, the facility must determine the organic HAP and VOC emissions
that were generated by the process over the 90-day period immediately preceding the implementation of the alternative
application method. During this initial 90-day period, only HVLP or electrostatic spray guns could be used. These
emissions would be compared to the organic HAP and VOC emissions generated by the same process using the alternative
application method to coat an equivalent amount of parts and assemblies as coated during the initial 90-day period
using identical coatings. The organic HAP and VOC emissions generated during the use of the alternative application
method must be equal to or less than the emissions generated during the initial 90-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content levels, an owner or operator would have the flexibility
to use compliant coatings or to average uncontrolled compliant and non-compliant coatings. (Averaging between
primers and topcoats would not be allowed, nor would averaging between controlled and uncontrolled coatings.) Test
methods and procedures are, therefore, necessary to determine the organic HAP and VOC content of each primer and topcoat
as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing that Method 24 be used for determining the VOC content. This is a long-standing method for such
determinations. Sources may, at their discretion, use manufacturer's data for determining the VOC content rather
than Method 24. However, if there is found to be a difference in the VOC content as determined from the manufacturer's
data and that determined using Method 24, then the value obtained using Method 24 will always take precedence in compliance
determinations. Since there are no generally available methods for testing organic HAP content, the EPA is proposing
that the organic HAP content level be determined by each facility based on the formulation of each coating. The formulation
data would be supplied to the facility by the coating manufacturer. This would reduce the burden to the industry and
promote consistent identification of the total organic HAP content among all users. Several coating manufacturers
have indicated to the EPA that they are willing to supply such information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the proposed standards would require the organic HAP contents to be determined on a ``less water as
applied'' basis and VOC contents on a ``less water and exempt solvents as applied'' basis. Thus, unless the coating
is applied as received, procedures must be adopted to change ``as received'' organic HAP and VOC content levels to
``as applied'' levels. This could be accomplished by analyzing a sample of the coating as applied using Method 24 or
through a calculation. The calculations to do this are well known and established (see A Guideline for Surface Coating
Calculations, EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;86&hyph;016, July 1986) and, thus, the EPA did not consider it necessary to
include the basic calculation formulas in the proposed rule. A determination of what is added to the coating before
it is applied must be made so that the ``as applied'' levels can be calculated. The EPA is proposing that each owner or
operator make such determinations on the basis of records kept at the facility. These are records that will be required
by the proposed rule and will be readily available to the owner or operator for making the necessary calculations.
The pertinent information (i.e., density, organic HAP content, and VOC content) of the additives would be based on
manufacturer supplied information. If that information is not available, then the owner or operator would be required
to develop a procedure for determining the missing information for approval by the Administrator.

Since the proposed standards for organic HAP and VOC content levels would allow each owner or operator to average organic
HAP or VOC content levels across uncontrolled primers and across uncontrolled topcoats, the procedures provide
the necessary formulas to calculate the volume-weighted average organic HAP or VOC across all primers or topcoats.
For compliant coatings, the EPA is proposing less complicated procedures for demonstrating compliance. This is
appropriate because each coating by itself as applied meets the organic HAP (or VOC) content level, and daily calculations
of the volume-weighted average HAP and VOC content as applied are not necessary. The proposed rule does, however,
require monthly determination of usage and HAP and VOC content as applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If control devices (e.g., incinerators, carbon adsorbers) are used, the proposed standards require them to achieve
an overall control efficiency of at least 81 percent. For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, it is necessary,
therefore, to identify the capture efficiency of the capture system, the destruction efficiency of the control device,
and, where feasible, operational parameters that would be monitored to ensure continuous compliance. The proposed
standards also include provisions for determining the capture and removal efficiencies. The test methods and procedures
being proposed for determining the capture and removal efficiencies are those that are typical for control devices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing that capture efficiency be determined by one of two methods depending on whether the capture system
is totally enclosed or not. A total enclosure would be verified according to the provisions specified in &sect;52.741,
appendix B, Procedure T of 40 CFR part 52 (and, thus would have a capture efficiency of 100 percent). The capture efficiency
of all other systems would be determined according to the procedures specified in &sect;52.741(a)(4)(iii) of 40
CFR part 52. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing that the removal efficiency of a control device be determined based on three runs, each run lasting
one hour. For control of organic compounds, Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, would be used
for selection of the sampling sites, and the gas volumetric flow rate would be determined using Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or
2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate. Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, would then be used to measure
either TOC minus methane and ethane or total organic HAP. Alternatively, any other test method or data that has been
validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a carbon adsorber is used, the EPA is proposing to use a mass balance procedure for determining the overall control
efficiency. The proposed rule contains procedures as specified in 40 CFR 60.433 for using a mass balance approach
that would calculate the amount of organic HAP and VOC applied and the amount recovered. This information would then
be used to calculate the overall control efficiency of the carbon adsorber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Method 309 is being proposed for determining the number of consecutive 24-hour periods in the rolling
material balance period for carbon adsorbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each owner or operator using a control device would be required to conduct an initial performance test. For control
devices other than carbon adsorbers, this test would consist of 3 one-hour runs. For carbon adsorbers, the test would
span the number of days specified for the rolling material balance period as calculated by proposed Method 309. In
addition, it is necessary to establish, during the initial performance test, operating parameters that would be
continuously monitored in order to show continuous compliance. For incinerators other than catalytic incinerators,
the operating parameter would be the firebox temperature. For catalytic incinerators, the operating parameters
would be the temperature of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed. No operating parameters
are required to be monitored on carbon adsorbers since the material balance calculations provide a continuous check
of proper operation.

Depainting operation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standards for the depainting of aerospace vehicles requires, in part, no organic HAP emissions, which
will be achieved through the use of chemical strippers that do not contain any organic HAP or the use of non-chemical
depainting methods or techniques. Since all of the known non-chemical depainting methods/techniques do not contain
any organic HAP, the only test method or procedures needed are those associated with determining whether a chemical
stripper contains any organic HAP. For the reasons noted earlier under the discussion on test methods for primers
and topcoats, the EPA is proposing that the organic HAP content be determined based on information supplied by the
manufacturer of the chemical stripper.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to demonstrate compliance with the organic HAP-containing chemical stripper usage limitation for spot
stripping and decal removal, the source must calculate an average annual usage per aircraft. Since there is only one
method to calculate this average (i.e., dividing the total gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper
used for spot stripping and decal removal by the number of aircraft stripped), the EPA is proposing to use this method
to determine compliance. The information needed for this calculation would be obtained from company records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Particulate inorganic HAP emissions are generated by blast depainting methods. Therefore, the EPA is proposing
that Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, be used to determine the control efficiency of particulate filtration systems
used on this process.

Chemical milling maskant application operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for chemical milling maskants limits the organic HAP content to the equivalent of 160 grams
per liter (1.3 pounds/gallon) less water as applied and limits the VOC content to the equivalent of 160 grams per liter
(1.3 pounds per gallon) less water and exempt solvents as applied. In determining compliance with the organic HAP
and VOC content levels, an owner or operator would have the flexibility to use compliant chemical milling maskants
or averaging uncontrolled compliant and non-compliant maskants. As for primers and topcoats, averaging uncontrolled
and controlled chemical milling maskants together would be prohibited. Test methods and procedures are, therefore,
necessary to determine the organic HAP and VOC content of each chemical milling maskant as applied. If control devices
are used, it is also necessary to determine the overall control efficiency of the control device. The test methods
selected and the rationale for the selection are identical to those presented above for primers and topcoats.

2. Monitoring Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with paragraph (a)(3) to section 114 of the Act, enhanced monitoring of stationary sources is required
to determine the compliance status of the sources, and whether compliance is continuous or intermittent. For affected
sources complying with the proposed standards through the use of control devices, initial compliance is determined
through the initial compliance test, and ongoing compliance through continuous monitoring. The EPA has proposed
the parameters to be monitored for certain types of control devices now used in the industry. The values of these parameters
that correspond to compliance with the proposed standards are set by the owner or operator during the initial compliance
test. If future monitoring indicates that control equipment is operating outside of the range of values established
during the initial performance test, then the owner or operator is out of compliance with the proposed standards,
except as specified for malfunctions in &sect;63.6(e)(3) of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cleaning operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For cleaning operations, the only portion of the standards for which monitoring requirements are being proposed
is for enclosed spray gun cleaner systems. These systems are stationary sources that have the potential to emit organic
HAP from around ill-fitting or worn seals or from leaking pumps or piping connections. The effectiveness of these
systems thus depends on their being ``vapor-tight'' and that there are no leaks from the pumps or piping of these systems.
Therefore, the EPA is proposing that such systems be visually inspected for leaks. Since most of the systems are used
to clean paint spray guns, leaks would be easily spotted by visual inspection as the result of solvent or paint residue
escaping around the source of the leak. The EPA does not believe that monitoring with leak detection equipment would
provide a significant increase, if any, in the detection of leaks from these systems. Therefore, the EPA is proposing
to require visual inspection only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA then considered how frequently the enclosed cleaners should be inspected. The EPA considered daily, weekly,
monthly, and yearly frequencies. The nature of the systems being inspected is not expected to result in sudden failure,
but rather failure due to wear and tear. Thus, the EPA considered it unnecessary to require daily or even weekly inspection.
On the other hand, one year was considered too long for a leak to go unrepaired. Therefore, the proposed standards would
require a monthly inspection of the systems. The EPA believes that this is a reasonable period between inspections,
without overburdening the industry and not allowing leaks to go unrepaired for an extended period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the proposed work practice and equipment standards require that containers used to store solvents and
solvent laden cloth and paper be closed when not in operation. The EPA could not identify any operating parameter that
would monitor whether this was being done. Nor could the EPA identify a parameter to monitor when atomized cleaning
is used. The proposed standards require the use of a device designed to capture the atomized solvent emissions. No
monitoring parameters were identified to indicate periods when the device may not be functioning or when it may have
been removed. Rather, the determination would be made during enforcement inspections as to whether the proper procedures
were being followed.

Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed monitoring requirements for primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations
concern the operation of control devices that may be used in demonstrating compliance with the organic HAP content
levels. For control devices, the parameters to be monitored are those that have been typically used in other standards.
For example, where catalytic incinerators are used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions, the proposed standards
require that the temperature of the air stream be monitored immediately before and after the catalyst bed. The rationale
for selecting the various control device parameters in this proposed rule is long standing, and for more information
see the proposal notice for the SOCMI reactor processes NSPS (55 FR 26966 through 26969, June 29, 1990). The EPA is,
therefore, simply proposing to adopt the same monitoring parameters as have been required for previous standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats, the proposed standards would require the use of particulate
filters or waterwash systems. Two parameters were identified that could be monitored that directly relate to the
performance of the system_air flow and pressure drop. The proposed rule, however, would require monitoring of only
the pressure drop across the filter or waterwash since the air flow is directly related to the pressure drop. Monitoring
of both parameters was considered to be redundant.

Depainting operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nature of the proposed standards for depainting operations is such that no meaningful monitoring requirement
was identified for the proposed organic HAP emission standards. The organic HAP content (less water as applied) of
the chemical strippers used must be calculated or determined. But once identified, there are no requirements concerning
their application.

Cleaning operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for hand-wipe cleaning operations require cleaning solvents to be used that either comply
with the approved composition list or have a composite vapor pressure less than or equal to 45 mm Hg at 20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

&cir;F). In order to determine whether these requirements are being complied with, it is necessary to keep data on
the cleaning solvents being used in these operations. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator
keep for each cleaning solvent used at the facility, a record of the name of the cleaning solvent and documentation
that shows the organic HAP content and organic HAP constituents. In addition, the EPA is proposing the following records
for specific cleaning operations be kept.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that conforms to the approved composition list,
the records that would be maintained are the name of each cleaning solvent, documentation demonstrating compliance
to the approved composition list, and annual purchasing records showing the annual volume purchased of each. For
each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that does not conform to the approved composition list,
but does conform to the vapor pressure requirement, the information required to be recorded would be the name of each
cleaning solvent, the monthly usage of the cleaning solvent at each operation, the composite vapor pressure, the
manufacturer's data sheets or other documentation of the vapor pressure, and any test reports and calculations performed
to determine the composite vapor pressure (in order to assess compliance with the vapor pressure limit).

&cir;F) are only used for the exempted cleaning operations. To this end, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator
keep daily records of the name and volume of each cleaning solvent used in each exempt hand-wipe cleaning operation,
as well as the parts, assemblies, or subassemblies on which it is used. The EPA is requiring daily recordkeeping for
these non-compliant solvents so that adequate records exist to determine that the solvents are used only in the exempt
operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also proposing that records be kept of each leak found when visually inspecting enclosed spray gun systems.
These records would consist of source identification, the date of discovery of the leak, and the date of repair in order
to ensure that repairs are completed within 15 days as required by the proposed standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those portions of the cleaning operation standards that require containers to be closed when not in use, the EPA
is not proposing any recordkeeping requirements. Nor is the EPA proposing any recordkeeping requirements for the
cleaning of spray guns (other than for enclosed spray gun cleaners) or flush cleaning.

Primer and topcoat application operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For all primer and topcoat application operations, regardless of which methods are used to comply with the proposed
standards, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator keep records of the name of each coating and its organic
HAP and VOC content as received. In addition, the EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping requirements
depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content levels are being met. If an owner or operator is using compliant coatings
to meet the organic HAP or VOC content levels, the EPA is proposing that the owner or operator keep records that identify
for each coating (primer, topcoat) used each calendar month, the volume of each coating formulation used each month,
the masses of organic HAP and VOC emitted per unit volume as applied, and the manufacturer's data, calculations, and
test results (including Method 24 results taken during an enforcement inspection) used to determine organic HAP
and VOC content of each as applied. Daily records are not necessary since, if the coatings are compliant, the emissions
from the coatings will not exceed the emission limitation in the proposed standards on a daily basis. Monthly records,
however, are necessary to maintain a check that compliance is being maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner or operator elects to meet the organic HAP or VOC content level by averaging, the EPA is proposing that records
of the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC contents for primers and topcoats be kept as well as all of
the data and calculations used to calculate these values. This would include the volume, organic HAP content as applied,
and VOC content as applied of each coating. This level of information is required for an inspector to determine whether
the facility was in compliance and whether the proper data and calculations were being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a control device is used, each owner or operator would be required to keep a record (or, where allowed in the proposed
standards, daily averages) of the various control device operating parameters being monitored. Since for some control
devices compliance with the proposed standards is dependent on the control device being operated properly, these
records are necessary to determine compliance. Specifically, a source would be out of compliance if the recorded
parameters were out of range. As noted earlier, for incinerators, this would be continuous records of the operating
temperature(s), while no operating parameters are required for carbon adsorbers. Thus, the EPA is requiring these
records for compliance determinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recordkeeping requirements for inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats, which require recording
of the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash once per shift during which coating operations occur, were included
to provide a means of obtaining data that can be used to verify that the pressure drop limits are not being exceeded.
The records can also be used by the facility to determine when preventative maintenance should be performed on the
filter or waterwash system. The proposed rule would also require that the log include the pressure drop operating
range as specified by the manufacturer so that the compliance information is readily available at all times.

Depainting operation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For compliance with the standard of no organic HAP emissions through the use of chemical strippers that contain no
organic HAP, the minimum records identified were the name of each chemical stripper used in depainting operations,
the organic HAP content of each stripper, and its supporting documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards contain an exemption for spot stripping and decal removal that is based on an annual average
volume of organic HAP-containing stripper per aircraft. To ensure that this exemption is being complied with, the
EPA is proposing that the owner or operator of an affected source record these annual averages. Consequently, records
must be maintained of the number of aircraft depainted, the volume of organic HAP-containing stripper used for spot
stripping and decal removal, the average number of gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used per
aircraft, and all supporting data and calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the proposed standards have an exemption for radomes and parts depainting. While radomes are self-evident,
the parts normally removed are not. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator keep an up-to-date
list of all aircraft depainted at the facility and a list of all parts normally removed prior to depainting from each
aircraft model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that it is necessary to ensure that, if a depainting facility uses organic HAP-containing chemical
strippers, they only be used on spot stripping, decal removal, radomes and parts. Tracking the daily use of the organic
HAP-containing chemical strippers by volume would indicate whether or not these strippers are being used on the aircraft
body. The amount of stripper required to depaint an aircraft body is substantially higher than for the exempted operations.
Therefore, an accounting of stripper usage is necessary to ensure organic HAP-containing stripper is not being used
on the aircraft body. The EPA considered requiring records of the usage of both strippers that contain organic HAP
and those that do not contain organic HAP be maintained. However, the EPA believes that requiring records of both types
of stripper usage would be overly burdensome to the industry and that adequate accounting would be obtained from the
usage of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper. In addition, records of the usage of organic HAP-containing
strippers are already being required for spot stripping and decal removal. Consequently, the EPA is proposing that
records be kept only of the organic HAP-containing chemical stripper usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily recordkeeping of the usage of these strippers was considered to be unnecessary since the intent of the records
is to show long-term trends. Annual records, on the other hand, would require too long of a period to establish these
trends. Consequently, the EPA is requiring monthly records of the organic HAP-containing stripper usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever non-chemical depainting techniques are being used, the proposed standards would require that during periods
of malfunction, alternate depainting methods be used for no more than 14 consecutive days unless the alternative
method contains no organic HAP. In order to determine compliance with these requirements, records must be kept on
the dates the malfunction occurred and was corrected, the methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the
malfunction, and the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For inorganic HAP emissions, records of the daily pressure drop readings are necessary to ensure that the requirements
of the proposed standards are being met. The rationale for this requirement is identical to that presented for primers
and topcoats. In addition, records must be maintained of the manufacturer's recommended pressure drop limits, the
particulate filter control efficiency, and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the control
efficiency so that compliance determinations can be made.

list of which wastes are subject to RCRA requirements and which are subject to the proposed rule, and to keep on file
the documentation supporting these determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA received a comment requesting that records be maintained of the quantity and type of solvents stored and disposed,
as well as the disposal facility (if applicable). The purpose of these records would be to ensure that the wastes are
not improperly disposed since the wastes may not be RCRA listed wastes (and, thus, not subject to applicable RCRA recordkeeping
requirements). The EPA is requesting additional comments concerning the addition of these recordkeeping requirements.
The comments should address whether there are any wastes that contain HAP that are not subject to RCRA and, if so, whether
the recordkeeping requirements under these standards should apply to all affected waste streams or only non-RCRA
listed waste streams. In addition, the comments should address what burden these requirements would impose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the specific reporting requirements described below for each affected source, the proposed rule adopts
the provisions specified in &sect;63.9(a) through &sect;63.9(e) and &sect;63.9(h) through &sect;63.9(j) and
&sect;63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

 However, certain time periods specified in these sections were changed as detailed in Section II.F of this preamble.
These time periods were changed in order to provide additional time for the EPA to review requests for changes to time
periods for submittal of reports and for owners or operators to respond to EPA requests. These were the only paragraphs
from these sections (i.e., &sect;63.9 and &sect;63.10) that were considered to be applicable to the proposed rule.

The proposed rule would require an owner or operator to submit the following four types of reports: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Initial notification, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notification of compliance status, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Periodic reports, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Other reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose and contents of each of these reports are described in this section. The wording of the proposed rule requires
all reports to be submitted to the ``Administrator.'' The term Administrator refers either to the Administrator
of the EPA, an EPA regional office, a state agency, or another authority that has been delegated the authority to implement
this rule. In most cases, reports will be sent to state agencies. Addresses are provided in the General Provisions
of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

Records of reported information and other information necessary to document compliance with the regulation are
required to be kept for 5 years. Per the General Provisions, the 2 most recent years must be kept on-site; the other 3
years may be kept off-site. Records pertaining to the design and operation of the control and monitoring equipment
must be kept for the life of the equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standards would require owners or operators who are subject to this subpart to submit an initial notification.
As outlined in the General Provisions, 40 CFR 63.9, this report serves two basic purposes: (1) Notifies the EPA that
an existing facility is subject to the proposed standards and (2) notifies the EPA of the construction of a new facility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A respondent must also report any facility modifications as defined in &sect;63.5. This report will establish an
early dialogue between the source and the regulatory agency, allowing both to plan for compliance activities. The
notice is due no later than 12 months before the final compliance date as specified in the proposed standards. Under
the proposed rule, the initial notification is not required from any source that has submitted a permit application
under title V of the Act, provided that the permit application has been submitted by the same due dates as for the initial
notification and that the state to which the permit application has been submitted has a permit program in place and
has received delegation of authority from the EPA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification of Compliance Status.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As adopted through the General Provisions, owners or operators who are subject to this subpart would be required to
submit a notification of compliance status. This report contains the information necessary to demonstrate that
compliance has been achieved, such as the results of performance tests, Method 24 tests, and design analyses, as well
as the methods that will be used for determining continuing compliance as outlined in the General Provisions, 40 CFR
63.9.

 Another type of information to be included in the notification of compliance status is the specific range of each monitored

and whether each source has operated within its designated operating parameters. The report would be due within 150
days after the final compliance date as specified in the General Provisions.

Although not specified in the proposed rule, a description of information specific to the aerospace industry that
should be contained in the initial compliance notification for each of the affected sources was presented earlier
in this preamble (see Section II.B.2, Reporting Requirements). The information presented in that section is not
necessarily exhaustive.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic Reports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is proposing to adopt a standard basis for submitting periodic reports for each of the operations for which
standards are being proposed. Semiannual reports would be required whenever an operation was found to be in non-compliance
or whenever a monitored parameter exceeded its value. For example, for a primer application operation where averaging
is used, a semiannual report would be triggered for any daily period covered by the semiannual report in which the daily
primer volume-weighted average organic HAP content limit was exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Semiannual reports would also be required whenever a change occurred at a facility that might affect a source's compliance
status or that introduces a new element to the operation that was required to be reported in the notification of compliance
status. For example, reformulation of a chemical milling maskant may change the organic HAP content of the maskant.
If the HAP content increases, then the owner or operator may have to average different or additional chemical milling
maskants together, or add a control device in order to maintain compliance. This change in compliance status would
trigger a semiannual report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For operations that did not experience any exceedances or changes, the EPA is proposing that annual reports be submitted
to this effect. In addition, annual reports are required where compliance is determined on an annual basis and exceedances
of these annual limits occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to adopt the above schedule of reporting because it provides a fair balance between the need to
know certain information in a timely fashion and reduces the burden to industry and provides consistency within this
regulation. The following paragraphs discuss in more detail the specific types of information to be included in these
various periodic reports. The information being requested is that which the EPA believes is necessary in the enforcement
of the proposed rule.

Cleaning operation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Periods of non-compliance would be transmitted to the EPA in a semiannual report. An example of non-compliance for
hand-wipe cleaning is the use of a cleaning solvent with a vapor pressure greater than 45 mm Hg (24.1 in. H

&cir;F) and does not conform to the approved composition list in a nonexempt cleaning operation. In addition, any
instance where a leaking enclosed spray gun cleaner is not repaired within 15 days would be considered an instance
of non-compliance that would trigger a semiannual report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also proposing a semiannual reporting requirement if changes, such as the use of new cleaning solvents,
previously reported cleaning solvents no longer in use, or new cleaning techniques for spray guns, are made to the
cleaning operations at the facility. Where a new or reformulated cleaning solvent is used, the semiannual report
would include documentation of its vapor pressure or documentation that it conforms to the approved composition
list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the cleaning operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required occurring
every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the cleaning operation has been in compliance with
the applicable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A semiannual report would be required whenever an exceedance of organic HAP or VOC content levels occurred, as well
as any time a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the
filters or waterwash was out of range. Where control devices are used to comply with the organic HAP or VOC content levels,
the EPA is also proposing to require semiannual reporting whenever a monitored parameter falls outside its appropriate
range. Such situations indicate noncompliance with the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no exceedances occur, each owner and operator would submit annual statements indicating that each affected facility
has been in compliance. The annual reports for primer and topcoat operations would also identify the number of times,
if any, the pressure drop limits for each filter or waterwash system were exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depainting Operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If new non-chemical depainting techniques are introduced to the facility since the filing of the notification of
compliance status or any subsequent semiannual report, the EPA is proposing semiannual reports to identify these
techniques. The semiannual report would be required to identify any period of malfunction of non-chemical depainting
methods and techniques and any period where the non-chemical depainting operation was not immediately shut down
when the pressure drop across the filters was out of range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For periods of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods, semiannual reports would be required that identify
the method or technique that malfunctioned, the date that the malfunction occurred and was corrected, a description
of the malfunction, the alternative method(s) used for depainting during the period of malfunction, and the date(s)
that the methods were begun and discontinued. This information is necessary so that adequate documentation is available
to ascertain whether malfunctions were repaired within the 15 day limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the facility would be required to report on a semiannual basis any new chemical strippers or changes to
existing formulations and the organic HAP content of each. A semiannual report would also be required for each 24-hour
period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting operation, other than from spot, radome, or parts stripping
or decal removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the semiannual report would be required to identify all changes in the type of aircraft depainted at the facility
and to identify the parts normally removed for depainting separate from the aircraft for each new type of aircraft
depainted. This is important because of the exemption being proposed for radomes and parts that are normally removed
prior to depainting the aircraft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the depainting operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required stating
that the depainting operation has been in compliance with the applicable standards. An annual report would also be
required whenever the calculated annual average volume of organic HAP-containing strippers used per aircraft for
spot stripping and decal removal exceeded the applicable limits. The annual report would also report the number of
times the pressure drop across the particulate filters used for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from non-chemical
depainting operations exceeded the limits specified by the manufacturer.

Handling and storage of waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed earlier, since an exemption exists for RCRA-regulated wastes, it is important to know which wastes are
subject to RCRA and which are not. Since facilities undergo change over time, it is possible that these designations
may change. Further, new waste streams may be created. Therefore, semiannual reports are being proposed to track
changes in the RCRA status of existing wastes and new wastes. An annual report would be required if no changes occurred
in the RCRA status to the existing waste streams and if no new waste streams were generated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Reports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The only ``other reports'' in the proposed rule are those that are required under the General Provisions, subpart
A of 40 CFR part 63.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Of particular note is the report required in response to periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. When the procedures
used during such periods are completely consistent with the plan, a report stating such is to be delivered or postmarked
by the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of each calendar half. If the procedures are not completely consistent
with the plan, an owner or operator is to report the actions taken within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent
with the plan, followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event. The EPA is proposing that for non-chemical
depainting malfunctions only, that the owner or operator report any plan inconsistency for dealing with the malfunction
within 24 hours after the inconsistent depainting technique is actually utilized. This is different from ``after
the end of the event'' because owners or operators may be able to adjust their depainting schedule to accommodate the
time to repair a malfunction without the need to implement their malfunction plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposes to allow affected sources the following time periods after promulgation for compliance, as provided
for in section 112(i) of the Act. All sources, whether uncontrolled or having in place control systems or measures
requiring upgrading to meet the new rule, would be required to reach full compliance within 3 years after promulgation
of the rule. In addition, all affected sources must comply with the compliance dates specified in &sect;63.6 (b) and
(c) of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA considered requiring earlier compliance to some parts of the proposed standards. However, comments received
from state agencies indicated that there would be far less burden enforcing the standards if there was a single compliance
date. Multiple compliance dates would make it difficult for agencies in states with numerous sources to keep track
of which standards applied to each facility and when compliance would have to begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA recognizes the need for the full three-year period for facilities to come into compliance due to the nature
of testing and qualification necessary for sources such as hand-wipe cleaning solvents, primers, topcoats, and
chemical milling maskants. For all these reasons, the EPA is proposing that all sources be allowed up to three years
after the date of promulgation of the rule to achieve compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is requesting comments, however, concerning alternative compliance dates for certain pollution prevention
and housekeeping measures. Specifically, the EPA is considering a compliance date of 90 days after the effective
date of the proposed standards for the cleaning operation housekeeping measures in &sect;63.744(a) of the proposed
rule, the use of enclosed containers for flush cleaning solvents in &sect;63.744(d), and the provisions for handling
and storage of waste in &sect;63.748. The EPA is also considering a compliance date of 180 days after the effective
date of the proposed standards for the spray gun cleaning provisions in &sect;63.744(c).

J. Operating Permit Program

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 40 CFR part 70, all major sources of HAP will be required to obtain an operating permit. Emission limits, monitoring,
and reporting and recordkeeping requirements are typically scattered among numerous provisions of State implementation
plans (SIP's) or Federal regulations. As discussed in the rule for the operating permit program, this new permit program
would include in a single document all of the requirements that pertain to a single source. Once a state's permit program
has been approved, each aerospace facility that is a major source within that state must apply for and obtain an operating
permit. If the state wherein the aerospace facility is located does not have an approved permitting program, the owner
or operator of an aerospace facility must submit a part 71 permit application if requested under 40 CFR part 71.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to grant a petition to delete Color Index (C.I.) Pigment Blue 15:1 from the ``copper compounds'' category
of the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA). C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1 is a mixture of C.I. Pigment Blue 15 (copper phthalocyanine) and copper
monochlorophthalocyanine. C.I. Pigment Blue 15 has already been deleted from the chemical category ``copper compounds'';
therefore, the Agency is treating this petition as a request to remove copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the
chemical category ``copper compounds.'' This proposed rule is based on EPA's belief that the copper ion from copper
monochlorophthalocyanine will not become available. In addition, EPA requests comment on the alternative of exempting
all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine from the
reporting requirements under the ``copper compounds'' category in EPCRA section 313.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued under section 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities must also report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106). When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic
chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA
to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e)(1),
any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added and deleted chemicals
from the original statutory list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions.
On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued a statement of policy and guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions
to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories. Pursuant to EPCRA section 313(e)(1),
EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation of
why the petition has been denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Description of Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 5, 1993, the Agency received a petition from the Color Pigments Manufacturers Association (CPMA) to delete
Color Index (C.I.) Pigment Blue 15:1 from the chemical category ``copper compounds'' subject to EPCRA reporting
requirements. C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1 is a mixture of C.I. Pigment Blue 15 (copper phthalocyanine) and copper monochlorophthalocyanine.
C.I. Pigment Blue 15 has already been deleted from the chemical category ``copper compounds'' (56 FR 23650); therefore,
the Agency is treating this petition as a request to remove copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the chemical category
``copper compounds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment, which is the subject of this petition, exists as two isomers. One isomer
is substituted with a single chlorine atom at the 1-position. The second isomer is substituted with a single chlorine
atom at the 2-position. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment is described by three CAS numbers. CAS number
15975&hyph;60&hyph;7 describes the copper 1-chlorophthalocyanine pigment. CAS number 147&hyph;13&hyph;7 describes
the copper 2-chlorophthalocyanine pigment. CAS number 12239&hyph;87&hyph;1 describes the copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigment with the position of a single chlorine atom unspecified. EPA is proposing to delete both isomers and hence
all three CAS numbers from the copper compounds category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the statement of policy and guidance on the metal compound categories of section 313 of EPCRA (56 FR 23703, May 23,
1991), EPA articulated the view that the toxicity of a metal-containing compound that dissociates or reacts to generate
the metal ion can be expressed as a function of the toxicity induced by the intact species and the availability of the
metal ion. Therefore, the degree of dissociation, bioaccumulation, and the level at which toxicity is induced by
the metal ion will be considered in making any delisting decision under EPCRA section 313. Thus, for petitions to exempt
individual metal-containing compounds from the reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313, EPA has decided
to base its decisions on the evaluation of all chemical and biological processes that may lead to metal ion availability
as well as on the toxicity of the intact species. These decisions will continue to be based on information provided
by the petitioner, Agency documents, and available literature. EPCRA section 313(d)(3) requires EPA to determine
that none of the criteria in EPCRA section 313(d)(2) are met before a chemical may be deleted from the EPCRA section
313 list. Under the policy for metal compound categories, this means that the effects induced by both a metal ion and
the intact species described by the metal compound category must be considered in light of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)
criteria. The effects induced by each metal ion described by the metal compound categories meet the criteria under
EPCRA section 313(d)(2). To delete a metal compound from the EPCRA section 313 list, EPA must conclude that the metal
ion will not become available at a level that can be expected to induce toxicity of a type described in EPCRA section
313(d)(2), and that the intact species does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). Accordingly, EPA will
generally deny petitions to delete chemicals if: (1) The intact species meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria,
(2) the chemical will dissociate or react to generate the metal ion at levels which can reasonably be anticipated to
cause adverse effects as described in EPCRA section 313(d)(2), or (3) EPA does not possess and the petitioners failed
to provide information to properly characterize the metal ion availability.

III. Technical Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has previously addressed the transformation processes that may generate copper ion from copper phthalocyanine
compounds in its review of a petition to delete three copper phthalocyanine pigments (Pigment Blue 15, copper phthalocyanine;
Pigment Green 7, copper poly(14)chlorophthalocyanine; and Pigment Green 36, copper hexabromodecachlorophthalocyanine)
from EPCRA section 313 reporting requirements. These three copper phthalocyanine pigments were deleted from EPCRA
section 313 on May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23650), because copper ion could not reasonably be expected to become available from
these pigments and because there was no indication from the available data that the intact pigments could reasonably
be anticipated to cause acute, chronic, or environmental toxicity. No data on the specific copper monochlorophthalocyanine
compounds which are the subject of this petition were found. However, in its analysis of the three previously deleted
compounds, the Agency used data on both brominated/chlorinated copper phthalocyanine and copper phthalocyanine.
This information was selected because Pigment Blue 15, Pigment Green 7, and Pigment Green 36 ranged in degree of bromination/chlorination
from zero (Pigment Blue 15) to 100 percent (Pigment Green 36). The transformation potential of many organic compounds
is dependent, in part, on the number of bromine or chlorine atoms present in the molecule. Although there are exceptions,
generally, the more highly brominated or chlorinated an organic compound is, the less likely it is to undergo biotic
or abiotic transformations. Once the transformation potential for copper phthalocyanine pigments at the extremes
of the range of possible bromination/chlorination had been assessed, the transformation potential for those copper
phthalocyanine pigments with bromination/chlorination greater than zero and less than 100 percent, including
copper monochlorophthalocyanine, could be inferred. The transformation processes reviewed included, hydrolysis,
photolysis, abiotic and biotic aerobic degradation, abiotic and biotic anaerobic degradation, bioavailability
of the ion when the compounds are ingested or inhaled, and bioaccumulation. The following discussion summarizes
the information reviewed.

Copper ion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 2 and 7). Copper is recognized as an essential element. It is essential to a number of normal physiological processes
including erythropoiesis, connective tissue metabolism, bone development, and nervous system function. The National
Academy of Sciences' recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 2.0 to 3.0 milligrams (mg) copper/day. Copper
is also used as a hematinic (to stimulate red blood cell production) in adults at a dose of 3.8 to 7.6 mg/day.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Human health effects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Copper poisoning has been demonstrated in animals and identified in humans. The liver is the main storage depot for
copper, and hepatic damage is associated with the accumulation of high levels of copper. Hepatic toxicity is characterized
by hepatocellular necrosis, regenerative activity, and cirrhosis. Kidney necrosis and elevated levels of serum
copper occur only after the liver begins to accumulate high levels of copper. These elevated serum copper levels can
progress to sudden hemolytic anemia and jaundice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The types of neurological effects associated with copper poisoning can include demyelination and cerebral degeneration.
These effects are thought to be related to defects in catecholamine metabolism. Alterations in brain neurotransmitter
systems have been observed in rats following intraperitoneal injections of 2 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day)
for 21 days. There are two groups that are at a particularly increased risk from copper exposure. These include individuals
with Wilson's disease, which is an inborn error in copper metabolism. The metabolic error in Wilson's disease allows
copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea, causing hemolytic anemia, neurological abnormalities,
and corneal opacity. In addition, individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies may also be
at greater risk of experiencing toxic effects from copper exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copper is classified in EPA's Group D (insufficient data) for carcinogenic potential. Copper is generally negative
in mutagenicity bioassays. Oral bioassays using copper were negative; subcutaneous injection of copper compounds
has been reported to induce tumor formation in one sex and strain of mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum contaminant level (MCL) established for copper under the Safe Drinking Water Act is 1.3 milligrams/liter
(mg/L) (3.6 mg/day).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ecological effects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Copper is very toxic to aquatic life. It is sometimes used as a biocide to control undesirable aquatic plants. EPA
has issued Water Quality Criteria for copper to protect aquatic life. The acute criterion in fresh water at a hardness
of 50 mg/L is 9.2 micrograms/liter (ug/L). The chronic criterion in fresh water is 6.5 ug/L at a hardness of 50 mg/L.
In salt water at a hardness of 50 mg/L, the acute criterion is 2.9 ug/L. At a hardness of 100 mg/L, the freshwater acute
criterion is 18 ug/L, the freshwater chronic criterion is 12 ug/L, and the salt water acute criterion is 2.9 ug/L.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Availability of copper ion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are expected to be extremely stable to chemically and biologically
induced transformations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thermal stability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on their structural analogy to other copper phthalocyanine pigments, copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigments are expected to be extremely stable thermally. Copper phthalocyanine pigments only begin to show signs
of decomposition at temperatures above 500 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (Ref. 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrolysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Copper phthalocyanine pigments have very low solubilities in water and are not expected to dissociate or hydrolyze
in water under environmental conditions. Hydrolysis of copper phthalocyanine pigments does not occur in basic and
nonoxidizing acidic media (Ref. 3). By structural analogy to copper phthalocyanine pigments for which data are available,
hydrolysis of the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments is not expected to be a significant environmental transformation
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Photolysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on studies carried out to determine the light fastness of structurally similar copper phthalocyanine pigments,
it appears that photolysis of copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments with resultant release of copper ion will
not occur (Ref. 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abiotic oxidation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Data indicate that under ambient environmental conditions, abiotic oxidation of copper phthalocyanine pigments
does not occur. More rigorous conditions are required to effect the oxidation of copper phthalocyanine pigments
and subsequent release of copper ion. These pigments can be chemically oxidized to yield phthalimides and copper
nitrate by boiling in dilute nitric acid (Ref. 3). Oxidation of the pigments can also occur by treatment with ceric
sulfate in dilute sulfuric acid at 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, or by reaction with potassium permanganate (Ref. 1). Because rigorous conditions are required to oxidize
copper phthalocyanine pigments, abiotic oxidation of copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments under ambient
environmental conditions is not likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microbial transformations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. No data on the anaerobic or aerobic biodegradability of the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments were found.
However, based on their extremely low solubility in water, their large cross-sectional diameter, and, with the exception
of the chlorine, the lack of substituent groups associated with facile primary degradation, copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigments are expected to be very resistant to degradation processes (Ref. 5).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On the basis of molecular weight, extremely low solubility in water, and data from subchronic toxicity tests on other
copper phthalocyanine pigments (Ref. 7), copper monochlorophthalocyanine is not expected to be appreciably absorbed
by any route of exposure or metabolized to yield copper ion.

Bioaccumulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because copper ion does not appear to be available from the copper phthalocyanine pigments, bioaccumulation of
copper ion is not a concern for copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments.

Summary.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By virtue of their structural analogy to other copper phthalocyanine pigments, EPA believes that the availability
of copper ion from the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments by hydrolysis, photolysis, and aerobic and anaerobic
transformations is negligible. Copper ion is not expected to be bioavailable from the copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigments. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are not expected to be appreciably absorbed by any route
of exposure or metabolized to yield the copper ion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manufacturing, use, and release
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Phthalocyanine blue pigments, such as copper monochlorophthalocyanine, are generally manufactured using one
of two methods. Copper monochlorophthalocyanine is manufactured by a phthalonitrile baking process or a solvent
process. The phthalonitrile baking process yields a range of 70 to 85 percent of product. The solvent process is more
popular and yields a purer form with a yield of 85 to 95 percent of product. Following the synthesis the crude product
is isolated. Finishing of the crude pigment can involve any of a number of processes such as dissolution in acid followed
by controlled precipitation, intensive milling with urea and sulfuric acid, milling with sodium chloride, or milling
with sodium chloride and solvent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copper monochlorophthlocyanine is often used in combination with other colorants. The primary uses of copper monochlorophthalocyanine
mixtures are as colorants for coatings, paints, printing inks, and plastics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPCRA section 313 reported releases of copper from three facilities which were identified as manufacturers of
copper monochlorophthalocyanine were 2,354 pounds in 1990 and 491 pounds for 1991. Facilities that process or use
copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment could not be identified and therefore releases from these facilities
could not be estimated.

IV. Explanation for Proposed Action To Delete Copper Monochlorophthalocyanine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is granting the petition and proposing to delete copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the copper compounds
category of the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. As stated in Unit II. of this preamble, petitions for delisting
a member of a metal compound category will be denied unless EPA can conclude that the intact species does not meet the
criteria of section 313(d)(2) and the metal ion will not be available at a level that can reasonably be anticipated
to induce toxicity. This decision to propose to delist copper monochlorophthalocyanine is based on EPA's belief
that: (1) The intact species does not meet the EPCRA section 313(d) criteria and (2) the copper ion from copper monochlorophthalocyanine
will not become available. After reviewing the petition and available information, EPA has concluded that copper
monochlorophthalocyanine is not known to cause or cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause acute or chronic toxicity
in humans or adverse effects in the environment, and thus does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA requests public comment on this proposed rule to delete copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the category ``copper
compounds'' on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. In addition, EPA requests comment on the alternative
of exempting all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine
from the reporting requirements under the ``copper compounds'' category on the EPCRA section 313 list. As stated
in Unit III. of this preamble, EPA has previously reviewed brominated/chlorinated copper phthalocyanine compounds
as well as the parent compound, copper phthalocyanine, and believes that its conclusions regarding the availability
of soluble copper from these compounds apply to all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only
hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine. Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the ADDRESSES unit.
All comments must be received by EPA on or before August 5, 1994.

VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant''
and therefore not subject to OMB review.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether
a substantial number of small entities would be significantly affected by the proposed rule. Because the proposed
rule eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described generically as an aromatic amino ether which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 and which is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This proposal
would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new
use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing, importing, or processing activities for a
use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to
evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would
provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under
section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action,
section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707.

II. Applicability of General Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use notices to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed
in detail in that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 and
a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672). EPA received adverse comments following publication for this chemical substance.
Therefore, as required by &sect;721.160, the final SNUR for P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 is being withdrawn elsewhere in
this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any of the other SNURs that were published in the October 4,
1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because those rules became final effective rules on December 3, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in a separate
action. The supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct
final SNUR for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for section 5(e) consent order:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Toxicity concern:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PMN substance and similar chemicals have been shown to cause mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity
(retinopathy), hepatotoxicity, reproductive effects, and aquatic toxicity at concentrations as low as 1 ppb (part
per billion) in test animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Recommended testing:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A 90&hyph;day subchronic rodent study (oral or inhalation route) with special attention given to hepatotoxicity,
histopathological exam of the male and female reproductive organs, and retinopathy is needed to help characterize
the neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, and reproductive effects of the PMN substance. The 90&hyph;day study must also include
for each treatment group a satellite group of exposed animals to be retained for an additional 90&hyph;day recovery
period to evaluate the possible reversibility of retinopathy. Light and electron microscopy should be utilized
to examine the ocular tissue (40 CFR 798.2650, modified). A 2&hyph;year two-species bioassay (40 CFR 798.3300) is
also necessary to characterize the carcinogenic potential of the PMN substance. The consent order contains two production
volume limits. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the first production limit without performing the 90&hyph;day
subchronic study. The PMN submitter has also agreed not to exceed the second, higher production volume limit without
performing the 2&hyph;year, two-species bioassay. In addition, an early life stage toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1600),
a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 chronic toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1330), an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050), and a coupled units test
(40 CFR 796.3300) would characterize the potential aquatic toxicity effects.

V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on October
4, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If
uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather
than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would
make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after October 4, 1993, will have to cease
any such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply
with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions
of advance compliance as codified at &sect;721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements
of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the
substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they
must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have
to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires.

VI. Economic Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged
for the substance in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record
for this proposed rule (OPPTS&hyph;50612B).

Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file.

VIII. Rulemaking Record
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50612B). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation
of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC),
also known as, TSCA Public Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. NCIC
is located in Rm. E&hyph;G102, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant'');
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's prioritities, or the principles set forth in
this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this proposed rule is
not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public
comments on the information requirements contained in this proposed rule.

(a)(6)(i), (b)(concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). The demonstration of an impervious barrier for gloves
required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section will require testing of the gloves as follows. There must be no permeation
of the PMN substance greater than 2 ppm after 8 h of testing in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) F739 ``Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation By Liquids and
Gases'' and ASTM F1194 ``Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing
Materials.'' The employer must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive the Agency's written approval of
the test results for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves. Gloves may not be used for a time period longer
than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of the work shift. As an alternative to the respiratory
requirements in this section, manufacturers, importers, and processors may use the new chemical exposure limits
provisions, including sampling and analytical methods which have previously been approved by EPA for this substance,
found in the 5(e) consent order for this substance. (ii)

Basis for revocation of section 5(e) consent order:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The order was revoked based on test data submitted under the terms of the consent order. Based on the Agency's analysis
of the submitted data, EPA has sufficient information to determine, for purposes of TSCA section 5, that the manufacture,
processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the PMN substance will not present an unreasonable risk
to the environment. Accordingly, EPA has determined that further regulation under section 5(e) is not warranted
at this time.

II. Objectives and Rationale for Proposed Revocation of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this proposed revocation, EPA
concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient
to make a reasoned evaluation of the environmental effects of the substance, and that the substance is expected to
be produced in substantial quantities and there may be significant or substantial environmental exposure. EPA identified
the tests necessary to make a reasoned evaluation of the risks posed by the substance to the environment. Based on these
findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the consent order for the substance and determined
that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the environmental effects of the substance.
EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and consequently
revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The proposed revocation of SNUR provisions for this substance designated
herein is consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is proposing a revocation
of SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. When this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice
of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under
section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Any person who submits comments claimed as confidential business information must mark the comments as ``confidential,''
``trade secret,'' or other appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission
will be placed in the public file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures
in 40 CFR part 2. Any party submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a public version
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file.

IV. Rulemaking Record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The record for the rule which EPA is proposing to revoke was established at OPPTS&hyph;50575 (P&hyph;89&hyph;650).
This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing the rule and includes the test data that formed
the basis for this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is proposing to revoke the requirements of the rule. Any costs or burdens associated with the rule will be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to amend its regulations concerning safety standards for self-propelled vessels carrying
bulk liquefied gases. These amendments are necessary because the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Code
on which many of these regulations are based has been amended. This proposal would make the changes necessary to align
these regulations with the IMO Code and to clarify certain provisions in the existing regulations.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1975, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (now the International Maritime
Organization or IMO) adopted the ``Code for Construction and Equipment of Ships Carring Liquefied Gases in Bulk''
(Gas Carrier Code), Resolution, A.328 (IX) without amendments. Coast Guard regulations based on this code were put
into effect May 3, 1979 (44 25986), Since 1975, the Gas Carrier Code has been amended four times: April 19, 1978 (see
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) XXXVIII/22), May 8, 1979 (see MSC XL/26), May 20, 1980 (see MSC/Cir. 284), and June
14, 1983 (see MSC/Cir. 356). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IMO's amendments to the Gas Carrier Code include corrections and clarifications, incorporation of standards for
new or novel containment systems, improvement of the carriage requirements for several of the more hazardous cargoes,
expansion of the list of chemicals to which the code applies, and revisions to align the Gas Carrier Code with the ``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC) and the ``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefield Gases in Bulk'' (IGC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Bulk Chemicals, the body responsible for maintenance
of the Code. The Coast Guard actively participated in the development of these changes to the Gas Carrier Code by submitting
position papers when the amendments were proposed. This rulemaking would revise the Coast Guard regulations in 46
CFR part 154 to reflect these amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most notable revisions would be the inclusion of standards for internal insulation tanks in new &sect;&sect;154.454
through 154.458, as well as in several existing sections. These standards would be included in order to bring the U.S.
regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 154 would be revised to include carriage requirements for seven cargoes previously regulated only under 46 CFR
part 153. The cargoes are diethly ether, a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide containing not more than 30%
ethylene oxide, isoprene, isopropylamine, monoethyamine, propylene oxide, vinyl ethyl ether, and vinylidene
chloride. These cargoes are being added in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with
the Gas Carrier Code.

Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a section by section explanation of the proposed changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 46 CFR part 40 would be removed. See the discussion in this section of the preamble on &sect;154.1745.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Existing &sect;154.1, Incorporation by reference, would be moved to new &sect;154.8 and revised to conform to
current formatting practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The following sections would be revised to include requirements from the amended Gas Carrier Code applicable to
internal insulation tanks: &sect;&sect;154.7, 154.235, 154.350, 154.454 through 154.459, 154.468, 154.615,
and 154.902.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The following sections would be revised to update references to other sections of this chapter and to incorporated
material and to correct spelling errors: &sect;&sect;154.12, 154.15, 154.151, 154.174, 154.176, 154.188, 154.195,
154.420, 154.439, 154.440, 154.448, 154.471, 154,1005, 154.1020, 154.1115, 154.1135, 154.1735, 154.1800, 154.1803,
and 154.1820.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section 154.19 would be revised to refer to the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying
Liquefied Gases in Bulk and to correct the date on the Gas Carrier Code for Existing Ships. The correct date is 1976.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 154.170 would be revised in accordance with an amendment to the Gas Carrier Code which sets the design temperature
of the primary and secondary cargo tank barriers. Also, paragraph (a) would be revised to comply with present procedures
for incorporating material by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Table 1 (&sect;154.172) would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by including higher tensile steel
grades AH, DH, and EH for vessels designed for prolonged exposure to low service temperatures. The revisions to this
table also would allow the use of grade A steel for design temperatures of down to ^5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for thicknesses of up to 15mm. The reference in the table to an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) standard would
be updated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 154.300 would be revised to allow category A machinery spaces, for example spaces for bow thruster machinery,
to be located forward of hold spaces if specially approved by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Section 154.315 would be revised to allow the Coast Guard to accept arrangements where the cargo pump room or cargo
compressor room is located outside of the cargo area, as ``cargo area'' is defined in &sect;154.7, if the limits of
the cargo area are extended to include the cargo pump or compressor room and the areas below those spaces. The Coast
Guard has accepted these arrangements in the past, but only on a case by case basis. In granting those acceptances,
the Coast Guard used the same criteria that is contained in the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code which this notice
proposes to adopt. Proposed &sect;154.315 continues to exceed the Gas Carrier Code in that the Gas Carrier Code allows
cargo pump and compressor rooms to be located below the weather deck. The Coast Guard takes the position that locating
the cargo pump and cargo compressor rooms on the weather deck reduces the likelihood of permitting vapor accumulation
in those rooms. Of course, such arrangements would be considered under the provisions of &sect;154.32 on equivalents.
This is consistent with the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code which require special approval for specified locations
of the cargo pump and cargo compressor rooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 154.315 also would be revised to require that personnel wearing protective clothing have complete access
to cargo pump and compressor rooms and are able to operate all valves necessary for cargo handling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Section 154.320 would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by specifying allowable openings for cargo
control stations not having access to accommodation, service, or control spaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Section 154.330 would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by allowing less stringent requirements
for openings to accommodation, service, or control spaces on vessels dedicated to cargoes which are neither toxic
nor flammable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Section 154.340 would be revised to clarify what is considered to be an acceptable access to gas-dangerous spaces,
such as duct keels and ballast compartments, and also to clarify that entry into fuel oil tanks must not be necessary
in order to perform inspections of the inner hull in the cargo area. These revisions correspond to amendments made
to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Section 154.345 would be revised to make it clear when airlocks are required. The proposal also would prohibit
essential electrical equipment which is non-explosion proof from being in a space protected by an airlock. This is
necessary because non-explosion proof electrical equipment in such a space must be automatically deenergized upon
pressure loss in the space.

14. Section 154.350 would be revised, as was the Gas Carrier Code, to waive the requirement for liquid leak detection
for certain spaces in internal insulation cargo containment systems, provided that those spaces are completely
filled with approved insulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Section 154.407 would be revised to designate the liquid height as ``Z
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and to clarify that the definition of Z
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not include small tank domes which are not considered part of the accepted total volume of the cargo tank. This
amendment is consistent with the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. As discussed earlier, &sect;&sect;154.454 through 154.458 would be added to address the use of internal insulation
tanks, as allowed by the amended Gas Carrier Code. The design of each of these tanks would be required to be approved
by the Coast Guard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. As stated earlier, table 3 in &sect;154.459 would be revised to include requirements for internal insulation
tanks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Under &sect;154.468, information on certain properties of the insulation material used in internal insulation
tanks would be required to be submitted to the Coast Guard for approval. These properties were added to the list of insulation
properties required to be tested for internal insulation tanks under the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Section 154.519 would be revised to clarify that any cargo piping component capable of being isolated in the liquid
full condition must be fitted with a relief valve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Section 154.522 would be revised in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code to allow relaxations approved
by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) of the minimum design temperature of open ended piping inside cargo tanks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The table in &sect;154.610 would be revised to raise the required test temperature for material in the thickness
range of 30 to 40mm from ^40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C to ^20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. Section 154.630 would be revised to clarify that the minimum yield strength used in the specified calculations
must be the yield strength of the aluminum alloy in the annealed condition. This section currently makes reference
only to the minimum tensile strength.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. Section 154.901 would be revised to clearly state that the cargo tank atmosphere is never permitted to be in the
flammable range. It is necessary to prevent a flammable atmosphere from developing on a liquefied gas vessel because
there are no requirements prohibiting sources of ignition from being present. These vessels are designed and operated
based on the assumption that a flammable atmosphere will never be present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Section 154.1110 would be revised to include storerooms containing high fire risk items in the area to be protected
by the water spray system and to clarify that each area listed is required to be covered by at least two jets of water.
These amendments are in line with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Section 154.1115 would be revised to include guidance for determining the required capacity of the water spray
systems. This revision is based on amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. Section 154.1320 would be revised to indicate that the pressure referred to is the design vapor pressure and not
the MARVS. This was also clarified in the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. New &sect;154.1327 would provide a formula for determining the maximum acceptable shutdown time once the emergency
shutdown valve is activated. This maximum would represent the time until the tank becomes liquid full. This is consistent
with amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. Section 154.1343 would be added to require the installation of detectors, as required in the amended Gas Carrier
Code, for determining when a leak has occurred in the primary barrier. The detectors need only indicate that there
is a leak. They need not be able to pinpoint that leak.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. Existing &sect;154.1400 would be revised and &sect;&sect;154.1401 and 154.1402 added to clearly indicate the
required safety equipment for all vessels and the additional equipment required for vessels carrying flammable
and toxic cargoes. These revisions correspond to amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. Section 154.1405 would be revised, as was the Gas Carrier Code, to clearly indicate that respiratory and eye protection
equipment intended for use as emergency escape equipment be so marked and never be used for fire fighting or cargo handling.
This section also would prohibit the use of filter-type respiratory equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. Section 154.1705 would be updated to include requirements for cargoes added to bring these regulations in line
with the Gas Carrier Code.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
32. Section 154.1718 would be added to require that cargo spaces with submerged electric cargo pumps be inerted when
any of the sever high vapor pressure cargoes are carried. This is required by the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. Section 154.1720 would be updated to include the new cargoes for which indirect refrigeration is required. This
is based on amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. Sections 154.1721 through 154.1724 would be added to include requirements for separate piping systems for toxic
products, flame screens on vent outlets, cargo tank quantity limitations, and vapor return connections. These requirements
are based on the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. Section 154.1745 would be revised to include all of the requirements from 46 CFR part 40 for vinyl chloride transfer
operations. Existing &sect;154.1745 references part 40, but there is no reason to have part 40's requirements contained
in a separate part. As part 50 addresses only vinyl chloride, this proposal would remove all of part 40 and transfer
its requirements to part 154.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Section 154.1760 would be revised to address the problem of stress corrosion cracking as it is addressed in the
Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. Section 154.1765 would be added to set forth the requirements for the carriage of diethyl ether and vinyl ethyl
ether in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. New &sect;&sect;154.1770 and 154.1775 would be added to set forth the requirements for the carriage of propylene
oxide and mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide which contain no more than 30% ethylene oxide by weight. These
requirements are consistent with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. Section 154.1818 would be revised to add new products to the list of products which may be carried if the shipper
certifies that they are inhibited. This revision is in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. Section 154.1831 would be revised to list the qualifications of the person in charge of cargo transfer operations.
Section 155.710 of 33 CFR, as referenced in proposed paragraph (a), was amended by a separate Coast Guard rulemaking
(CGD 86&hyph;034; ``Hazardous Materials Pollution Prevention'') applying &sect;155.710 to hazardous materials
transfers as well as to oil transfers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. Section 154.1832 would be added to clarify the necessary separation of cargo containment systems for incompatible
cargoes. This section is being proposed to ensure that incompatible cargoes are not allowed to come in contact with
each other on the vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. Section 154.1834 would be revised to clarify the responsibilities of the person in charge of cargo transfer operations
to ensure that the proper piping is used and to ensure that cargo vapors are properly handled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
43. Section 154.1850 would be revised to focus attention on the special problems caused by the gas absorbing qualities
of internal insulation materials. This is in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. Section 154.1870 would be revised to update the list of cargoes which are prohibited from being transferred via
bow or stern loading piping. This revision is based on the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45. Section 154.7 and the table 4 following existing &sect;154.1872 would be revised to include the minimum requirements
for the new cargoes added in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code and to update existing requirements and references.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget. It is not significant under the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulatory policies
and procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be
so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraphs 10e of the DOT regulatory policies and procedures is
unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would apply only to ``new gas vessels'', as the term is defined in &sect;154.7. No currently
operating ``new gas vessels'' would be affected. There are presently no U.S. flag ``new gas vessels'', and currently
operating foreign ``new gas vessels'' already meet the similar requirements of the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of this proposal on U.S. flag vessels constructed in the future is also anticipated to be minimal, because
the major part of this proposal allows for the carriage of cargoes previously required to be carried on chemical tankers
and for the addition of an alternative, less expensive, cargo containment system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the impact on foreign flag vessels built in the future will continue to be minimal because these vessels
will already comply with the requirements of the Gas Carrier Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposals would apply only to liquefied gas vessels, all of which are large in size and owned by large corporations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization
qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization,
please submit a comment (see

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection-of-information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.

2Type 1 tanks are tanks in which insulation or a combination of the insulation and one or more liners* function as a primary
barrier. The inner hull or independent tank structure functions as the secondary barrier when required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
3Type 2 tanks are tanks in which the insulation or a combination of the insulation and one or more liners* function as
both the primary and secondary barrier, and where these barriers are clearly distinguishable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
*A liner, as used in footnotes 2 and 3, means a thin, non-self supporting metallic, nonmetallic or composite material
which forms part of an internal insulation tank in order to enhance its fracture resistance or other mechanical properties.
A liner differs from a membrane in that a liner is not intended by itself to function as a liquid barrier.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before

engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.

supplemental information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its emphasis on better service for trademark applicants and registrants, the responsibility for receiving,
opening and routing of trademark mail is being transferred to the Assistant Commissioner for Trademarks. In order
to more efficiently process the mail, the Assistant Commissioner has determined that trademark-related mail, except
for trademark-related documents sent to the Assignment Branch for recordation and requests for certified copies
of trademark application and registration documents, should be sent directly to the Assistant Commissioner for
Trademarks, 2900 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3513, which is the location of the Trademark Operation.
Having mail sent directly to that address should speed up processing and reduce the amount of lost or misrouted mail.
The mail room at the South Tower Building will begin to receive and process mail on July 5, 1994. For a period after July
5, 1994, the Patent and Trademark Office (Office) will receive trademark-related mail at both the old address, Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, DC 20231, and at the new address, Assistant Commissioner for Trademarks,
2900 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia, 22205&hyph;3513. The Office is currently preparing a notice of proposed
rule-making to formally change the address for trademark-related papers. The Office will continue to maintain the
following special boxes, Box Trademark Application, Box ITU, Box AAU, and Box 5, for expedited processing and distribution
of specific types of documents. The Office encourages the continued use of these boxes with the new address.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
People may continue to file both patent and trademark-related papers directly at the Attorneys' Window located in

Sections 1.8 and 1.10 of title 2 of section 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations are waived, to the extent that, on or

trademark-related mail, except for trademark-related documents sent to the Assignment Branch for recordation
and requests for certified copies of trademark application and registration documents, may be addressed either
to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, DC 20231, or to the Assistant Commissioner for Trademarks,
2900 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia, 22202&hyph;3513. Patent-related mail should continue to be sent to: Commissioner

The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant
to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award grants to: Alaska Department of Community
and Regional Affairs, Energy Division; Idaho Department of Water Resources, Energy Division; Montana Department
of Natural Resources and Conservation, Energy Division; Oregon Department of Energy; and Washington State Energy
Office. The awards represent a continuation of DOE funded research, development, and demonstration of bioenergy-related
technologies. Public Law 97&hyph;88 provides the statutory authority for the proposed award.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Through the agencies identified above, the states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington have been engaged
in encouraging the development of bioenergy technologies for at least the last eleven years and have made successful
advances to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Produce cost-shared projects,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) establish regional bioenergy committees,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Interact with trade and professional associations,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provide technical assistance to developers and utilities,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Produce targeted information, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Implement regulatory incentives or reduce regulatory and environmental barriers which promote the development
of bioenergy technologies. Research, development, and demonstration activities occurring under these grant agreement
will provide needed data and information to DOE and the bioenergy industry. This helps remove barriers to the utilization
of bioenergy technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, these financial assistance applications are being accepted because the work to be funded is necessary
to continue activities presently being supported by DOE and the work will enhance the public benefit. DOE knows of
no other entities within respective state boundaries which are conducting these activities in the near or distant
future. The project period for the grant agreements is expected to begin in July 1994 for a five year period. DOE plans
to provide funding in the amount of $475,000 for each state for this project period (State in-kind match equals $125,000
and U.S. DOE funds equal $350,000).

 Under its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and reporting burden for respondents (as required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
conducts a consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies an opportunity to comment
on its continuing and newly proposed survey forms. This program helps to assure that: (a) Data can be reported by respondents
in the requested format; (b) burden of reporting is minimized; (c) survey forms are clearly understood; and (d) the
impact of collection requirements on respondents can be accurately assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments
concerning proposed changes to Form EIA&hyph;858, ``Uranium Industry Annual Survey,'' for the collection of 1994
data.

In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;275)
and the Department of Energy (DOE) Organization Act (Public Law 95&hyph;91), the Energy Information Administration
is conducting a comprehensive energy data and information program to collect, evaluate, assemble, and analyze periodic
data and information on the domestic uranium industry and economic and statistical information related to the adequacy
of domestic uranium resources and production capability to meet the Nation's near- and longer-term future needs.
The information collected is used by the Energy Information Administration to fulfill its monitoring and data dissemination
functions as mandated by the Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data collected on these forms provide a comprehensive statistical characterization of the domestic uranium industry
in these areas: (a) Uranium exploration, mining, reserves, uranium concentrate production, and employment related
to those activities, and (b) uranium marketing activities, inventory status, imports and exports, enrichment feed
deliveries, purchases of enrichment services, and use of unirradiated uranium in new fuel assemblies. Published
data from these surveys are used by the Congress, Federal and State agencies, the uranium and electric-utility industries,
and the general public. National and State level data are published in the EIA reports ``World Nuclear Capacity and
Fuel Cycle Requirements,'' ``Uranium Purchases Report,'' ``Uranium Industry Annual,'' and the ``Annual Energy
Review.''

Summary of Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the December 7, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 64399), the EIA proposed that 1994 data on uranium contracts (Item 1, Schedule B, annual Form EIA&hyph;858)
would be collected on a new quarterly survey form, Schedule M. Under this proposal also, the collection of 1994 data
under Schedule A and under Items 2&hyph;7 of Schedule B, Form EIA&hyph;858, would have been done annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After review of comments received in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice, the EIA has decided not to implement the proposed new Schedule M for 1994. Instead, the technical suggestions
for improving the Form EIA&hyph;858 survey provided in the comments will be used, where applicable, to revise the
annual Schedule B as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the EIA&hyph;858 survey for 1994, the EIA also has dropped the proposed new criteria that would have expanded the
number of data elements that would be releasable. The ``Provisions for Confidentiality'' declaration on the 1994
Form EIA&hyph;858 will remain the same as it was on the 1993 Form EIA&hyph;858. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the December 7, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, the EIA also proposed to use a one-page survey, Form EIA&hyph;851, to collect quarterly data on uranium concentrate
production for 1994. The EIA has decided not to pursue at this time implementation of a formal survey form for the EIA&hyph;851
collection. Instead, the current mode of monthly reporting of uranium concentrate production data through collection
of internal company production reports and phone surveys will be continued. The production data collected under
the EIA&hyph;851 survey will continue to be treated as confidential.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On the 1993 Form EIA&hyph;858 (left-hand column above), Items 1 and 6 (now Item 4) will be modified as described below.
Items 2, 3, 4 (now Item 5), and Item 5 (now Item 6) of Schedule B will continue to be collected without modifications.
Item 7, ``Enrichment Services Purchased by Utilities,'' on the 1993 Schedule B will be incorporated under Item 1.J,
``Utility Purchases of Enrichment Services,'' on the 1994 Schedule B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For Item 1 (Contract) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Item 1 will be modified as explained under ``a'' through ``h'' below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A check off box will be added to Item 1.B to identify contracts that have been renegotiated based on price-related
issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Item 1.C will be a new item to collect information on the term-of-delivery arrangement specified in a contract:
i.e., Whether the respondent classifies the reported contract as having a ``spot,'' short-term,'' ``medium-term,''
or a ``long-term'' delivery period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Item 1.D, ``Transaction Type,'' will provide separate check off boxes to indicate whether uranium materials were
sent or received under an Exchange transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Item 1.E will display a listing of applicable country identification codes from which respondents can choose to
report the country or countries of origin and/or destination for deliveries of natural uranium and the country of
enrichment services for enriched uranium. An ``Other'' space will be provided for respondents to write in a country
name and its identification code not listed under item 1.E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Item 1.F will be designed to collect data on individual quantities of delivered uranium and the type of material
delivered, its price, delivery date (DD/MM), whether the material was imported or exported, and country of origin.
For deliveries of enriched uranium product (EUP), the quantity will be reported as kilograms of uranium (KgU). The
transaction tails assay, the product assay, and the feed assay also will be reported to allow the EIA to calculate the
natural uranium feed component quantity as equivalent U

 for each delivered quantity. For EUP, the country of enrichment will be reported instead of the country of uranium
origin. For deliveries of both natural uranium and EUP, forecast for firm and optional deliveries will be requested
for a five-year forward period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Reporting the contract pricing mechanism under Item 1.H will be simplified to: (a) Request respondents to report
whether a pricing arrangement under a market-price related contract specifies a ``floor price'' or a ``no floor price'';
(b) add a check off box to capture ``spot-market price'' pricing arrangements; and (c) allow pricing arrangements
other than for ``market-price related'' and ``contract price'' to be reported as ``Other'' and briefly described
in the space provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Under Item 1.I, respondents will be requested to briefly describe the options that are allowed under the contract
for the seller and/or the buyer (purchaser). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Utility purchases of enrichment services (formerly Item 7 of Schedule B) will be reported under Item 1.J in order
to collect the reporting of all utility contracting activities under Item 1. This new format will permit the respondent
to report individual quantities of separative work units (SWU) purchased by a utility by the date of delivery, seller's
name, and the country of enrichment origin.

Take notice that on May 20, 1994, Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Rayburn Electric), tendered for filing
proposed changes to its FERC Electric Service Tariff, Rate Schedule WP&hyph;S. Rayburn Electric proposes to replace

3.18 percent) from the existing FERC rate and decrease revenues by $7,223 (or 0.01 percent) from the existing PUCT
rate based upon the 12 month period ending December 31, 1994.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has revised
the application for Martin Dam Project, located on the Tallapoosa River, in Elmore, Coosa, and Tallapoosa Counties,
Alabama, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed revised recreation plan. The Commission
staff concluded that approval of the application for the revised recreation plan, would not constitute a major Federal
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for minor license for the proposed Coolemee Hydroelectric Project located on the South Yadkin River
in the Town of Coolemee, Davie County, North Carolina, and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (FEA) for
the proposed project. In the FEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the
proposed project and has concluded that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigative measures,
would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Take notice that on May 26, 1994, Equitrans, Inc. (Equitrans), 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15275, filed
in Docket No. CP94&hyph;570&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to install a delivery tap under
Equitrans' blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;508&hyph;000 and transferred to Equitrans in Docket
No. CP86&hyph;676&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request
that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equitrans proposes to install one delivery tap in the City of Coal Center, Pennsylvania to provide gas transportation
service to Equitable Gas Company, a division of Equitable Resources, Inc. (Equitable). Equitrans projects the quantity
of gas to be delivered through the delivery tap will be approximately 1 Mcf on a peak day. Equitrans states it will charge
Equitable the applicable transportation rate contained in Equitrans' tariff on file with and approved by the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equitrans further states that the 1 Mcf per day of peak service will not impact Equitrans' peak day and annual deliveries.
Equitrans also states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries without detriment to its other
customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $144,864.85,
plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order that the DOE issued to N. C. Ginther Company
on March 25, 1983. The Consent Order resolved all civil and administrative claims and disputes between N. C. Ginther
Company and the DOE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has determined to distribute the Consent Order fund in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of propane,
butane, and natural gasoline from N. C. Ginther Company will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in
the first stage. The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section
III of the Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the
number of gallons of propane, butane, and natural gasoline which they purchased from N. C. Ginther Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed
in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of
1986 (PODRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before November 30, 1994. Instructions for the completion of refund
applications are set forth in Section IV of the Decision that immediately follows this notice. Applications should
be sent to the address listed at the beginning of this notice.

may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund procedures. 10 CFR
205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by the ERA
on July 20, 1993, for funds obtained due to alleged pricing violations in the sale of propane, butane, and natural gasoline
(natural gas liquids products). The funds at issue in that Petition were obtained through settlement of DOE enforcement
proceedings involving N. C. Ginther Company (Ginther), pursuant to 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. The present Decision
will set forth final procedures for the distribution of these funds to qualified purchasers of Ginther's natural
gas liquids (NGL) products.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period covered by the Consent Order (September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977), Ginther was a ``gas plant
operator'' (as defined in 10 CFR 212.162) and its sales were subject to DOE price regulations. Accordingly, Ginther
was subject to the DOE Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations. An ERA audit of Ginther's records revealed possible
violations of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations, 10 CFR part 212 subparts E and K, in specified transactions
during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977 (the consent order period).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consequently, the ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation (NOPV) to Ginther on December 31, 1980, alleging pricing
violations in the sale of propane, butane, and natural gasoline during the audit period. On March 25, 1983, Ginther
and the DOE entered into a Consent Order. The Consent Order refers to the ERA's allegations of regulatory violations.
It also includes Ginther's denials that any such violations occurred.

Ginther owned all or a portion of four gas processing plants for various lengths of time during the audit period. In
addition, Ginther owned and operated Ginther Energy Marketing Company and A &amp; V Gas Service, Inc. In accordance
with the definition of a firm in 10 CFR 212.31, the four gas processing plants, Ginther Energy Marketing Company, and
A &amp; V Gas Service, Inc., constitute one firm and were regarded as such by ERA in the audit. Notice of Probable Violation
issued to N. C. Ginther dated December 31, 1980.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the Consent Order, there is a total of $144,864.85, plus accrued interest, available for restitution.
This Decision concerns the distribution of all funds in the Ginther escrow account.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Proposed Decision and Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 14, 1994, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the alleged violation amount obtained from Ginther. 59 FR 19005 (April 21, 1994). The OHA tentatively outlined procedures
under which purchasers of Ginther's NGL products could apply for refunds. In order to permit applicants to make refund
claims without incurring disproportionate costs as well as to allow the OHA to equitably and efficiently consider
those claims, we set forth a number of presumptions pertaining to refund procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we presumed that the alleged refined product overcharges were spread evenly over all of Ginther's sales of
NGL products during the Consent Order period. We therefore proposed that an applicant's potential refund generally
should be computed by multiplying the per-gallon refund amount by the number of gallons of Ginther's NGL products
that the claimant purchased during the Consent Order period. The resulting figure is referred to as the claimant's
``volumetric share'' of the Ginther Consent Order funds. Because an applicant may have been overcharged by more than
the volumetric amount, we proposed that an applicant could rebut the volumetric refund presumption by showing that
it sustained a greater amount of the overcharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it is potentially difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to demonstrate that one was forced to absorb
any overcharges from Ginther, we proposed to adopt a number of presumptions concerning injury. We proposed that resellers
and retailers claiming refunds of $5,000 or less, end-users, agricultural cooperatives, and certain types of regulated
firms would be presumed injured by Ginther's alleged overcharges. We proposed that refiners, resellers, and retailers
seeking refunds greater than $5,000 could receive a maximum of $20,000 based upon 40 percent of their volumetric share
without having to prove injury. We also proposed to presume that claimants who made only spot purchases from Ginther
were not injured and must rebut that presumption to receive a refund. We stated that applicants not covered by one of
the injury presumptions would be required to demonstrate that they were forced to absorb any overcharge by Ginther
in order to receive their full volumetric shares of the Ginther Consent Order funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we proposed that any money remaining after all Ginther refund claims are analyzed should be disbursed as
indirect restitution in accordance with the provisions of the Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986
(PODRA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4501&hyph;4507 (1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDO provided a period of 30 days from the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which comments could be filed regarding the tentative refund process. More than 30 days have elapsed and the OHA
has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures for the distribution of the Ginther settlement funds.
Consequently, the procedures will be adopted as proposed.

A. Eligibility for Refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, the Consent Order resolved all civil and administrative claims between DOE and Ginther. Accordingly,
to the extent that is possible, the Ginther Consent Order amount of $144,864.85, plus accrued interest, will be distributed
to purchasers of covered Ginther NGL products who can show that they were injured by Ginther's pricing practices during
the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Calculation of Refund Amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are adopting a volumetric method to apportion the Ginther escrow account. Under this volumetric refund approach,
a claimant's allocable share of the refined products pool is equal to the number of gallons of covered products purchased
during the Consent Order period times a per gallon refund amount. We will derive the volumetric figure (per gallon
refund amount) by dividing the $144,864.85 received from Ginther by the total volume of NGL products sold by the firm
during the regulatory period, 25,312,920 gallons. This yields a volumetric refund amount of $.0057 per gallon, exclusive
of interest. This method is based upon the presumption that the alleged overcharges were spread equally over all gallons
of NGL products sold by Ginther during the regulatory period.

Nevertheless, we realize that the impact on an individual claimant may have been greater than the volumetric amount.
Therefore, the volumetric presumption will be rebuttable, and we will allow a claimant to submit evidence detailing
the specific overcharges that it incurred in order to be eligible for a larger refund.

and (3) it was injured by those overcharges. See

Under the volumetric approach, an eligible claimant will receive a refund equal to the number of gallons of covered
products that it purchased from Ginther during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977, multiplied by
the per gallon volumetric amount for this proceeding. Accordingly, each claimant will be required to establish,
by documentation or reasonable estimation, the volume of products that it purchased during this period. In addition,
each successful claimant will receive a pro rata portion of the interest that has accrued on the Ginther funds since
the date of remittance. As in previous cases, we will establish a minimum amount of $15 for refund claims.

C. Showing of Injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each claimant will be required to document its purchases of covered products from Ginther during the Consent Order
period. In addition, in order to receive a refund, an applicant generally must demonstrate through the submission
of detailed evidence that it did not pass on the alleged overcharges to its customers. See,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, as we have done in many prior refund cases, we will adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for claimants
in each category listed below. These presumptions are intended to ease what would be a time-consuming and potentially
expensive process if an applicant were forced to demonstrate that they absorbed the alleged overcharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. End-Users 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we are adopting the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer
of Ginther NGL products whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the alleged overcharges
settled by the consent order. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls
during the consent order period and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference
to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of goods and
services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. Id. Therefore, end-users
of Ginther NGL products need only document their purchase volumes from Ginther during the consent order period to
make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the alleged overcharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Regulated Firms and Cooperatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmental
agency, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a public utility, or an agricultural cooperative which is required by its charter to pass through cost savings to
its member purchasers, need only submit documentation of purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative,
sold to its members. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative will also be required to certify that it will pass any
refund received through to its customers or member-customers, provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to
accomplish the restitution, and certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membership group
of the receipt of the refund. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Marathon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 14 DOE at 88,514&hyph;15. This requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm,
any overcharge would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should
be passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreement which controls
its business operations would ensure that the alleged overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed through
to its member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small claims presumption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We will adopt a ``small claims'' presumption that resellers requesting relatively small refunds were injured by
the alleged overcharges. Under the small claims presumption, a refiner, reseller, or retailer seeking a refund of
$5,000 or less, exclusive of interest, will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond documentation of the
volume of Ginther products it purchased during the consent order period. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
TOGCO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 12 DOE at 88,210. This presumption is based on the fact that there may be considerable expense involved in gathering
the types of data necessary to support a detailed claim of injury; for small claims the expense might even exceed the
potential refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified refund procedures for small claims could deprive injured
parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claims presumption is desirable because
it allows the OHA to process the large number of routine refund claims in an efficient manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to qualify for a refund under the small claims presumption, a refiner, reseller, or retailer must have purchased
less than 877,280 gallons of Ginther products during the consent order period. However, an applicant, who has purchased
more than 877,280 gallons of Ginther products during the consent order period, may elect to limit its refund to the
small claims presumption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mid-Level Claim Presumption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, a refiner, reseller, or retailer claimant whose allocable share of the refund pool exceeds $5,000, excluding
interest, may elect to receive as its refund either $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share, up to $20,000,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 whichever is larger.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The use of this presumption reflects our conviction that these larger, mid-level claimants were likely to have experienced
some injury as a result of the alleged overcharges. See

Marathon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 14 DOE at 88,515. We are adopting a 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all mid-level claimants in this proceeding.
Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentation of its purchase volumes of
Ginther NGL products during the consent order period in order to be eligible to receive a refund of 40 percent of its
total allocable share, up to $20,000, or $5,000, whichever is greater.

A claimant who attempts to make a detailed showing of injury in order to obtain 100 percent of its allocable share but,
instead, provides evidence that leads us to conclude that it passed through all of the alleged overcharges, or that
it is eligible for a refund of less than the applicable presumption-level refund, may not then be eligible for a presumption-based
refund. Instead, such a claimant may receive a refund which reflects the level of injury established in its application.
No refund will be approved if its submission indicates that it was not injured as a result of its purchases from Ginther.

injury as a result of those purchases. As we have previously stated, spot purchasers generally had considerable discretion
as to the timing and market in which they made their purchases and therefore would not have made spot market purchases
from a firm at increased prices unless they were able to pass through the full amount of the firm's selling price to their
own customers. See,

, 8 DOE at 85,396&hyph;97. Accordingly, a spot purchaser claimant must submit specific and detailed evidence to rebut
the spot purchaser presumption and to establish the extent to which it was injured as a result of its spot purchases
from Ginther.

In prior proceedings, we have stated that refunds will be approved for spot purchasers who demonstrate that: (1) They
made the spot purchases for the purpose of ensuring a supply for their base period customers rather than in anticipation
of financial advantage as a result of those purchases and (2) they were forced by market conditions to resell the product
at a loss.

We may also receive claims based upon Ginther's alleged failure to furnish products that it was obliged to supply under
the DOE allocation regulations that became effective in January 1974. See 10 CFR part 211. Any such applications will
be evaluated with reference to the standards set forth in subpart V implementation cases such as

 977 F.2d 601 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1992). These standards generally require an allocation claimant to demonstrate
the existence of a supplier/purchaser relationship with the consent order firm and the likelihood that the consent
order firm failed to furnish NGL products that it was obliged to supply to the claimant under 10 CFR part 211. In addition,
the claimant should provide evidence that it had contemporaneously notified the DOE or otherwise sought redress
from the alleged allocation violation. Finally, the claimant must establish that it was injured and document the
extent of the injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In our evaluation of whether allocation claims meet these standards, we will consider various factors. For example,
we will seek to obtain as much information as possible about the agency's treatment of complaints made to it by the claimant.
We will also look at any affirmative defenses that Ginther may have had to the alleged allocation violation. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marathon/RFI, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19 DOE &para;85,575. In assessing an allocation claimant's injury, we will evaluate the effect of the alleged allocation
violation on its entire business operations with particular reference to the amount of product that it received from
suppliers other than Ginther. In determining the amount of an allocation refund, we will utilize any information
that may be available regarding the portion of the Ginther consent order amount that the agency attributed to allocation
violations in general and to the specific allocation violation alleged by the claimants. Finally, since the Ginther
consent order fund is less than Ginther's potential liability in the proceedings, we will pro rate those allocation
refunds that would otherwise be disproportionately large in relation to the consent order fund.

In the event that money remains after all refund claims from the Ginther funds have been analyzed, the remaining funds
in that account will be disbursed as indirect restitution in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy
determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties
in subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in energy conservation programs.
The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and any funds in the Ginther consent order escrow account
that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed in
accordance with the provisions of PODRA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
to eligible claimants $870,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order entered
into with Dane Energy Company on December 16, 1993. The funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations
of the DOE price and allocation regulations involving the sale of crude oil during the period December 1978 through
December 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has proposed to distribute the Consent Order funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge
monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products.
Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during
the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallons of petroleum products
which they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence

Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)
may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund procedures. 10 CFR
205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price
regulations.

In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by the ERA
on April 8, 1994, for crude oil overcharge funds. The funds at issue in this petition were obtained from Dane Energy
Company (Dane). This Office issued a Remedial Order to Dane finding violations of the crude oil pricing regulations
during the period December 1978 through December 1980.

public interest for DOE to compromise its claims against Dane on an ability-to-pay basis where, as here, the financial
status of the covered party can be satisfactorily determined, DOE agreed to enter into a Consent Order, whereby Dane
agreed to remit $870,000. The DOE received $870,000 on April 8, 1993. This Decision and Order establishes the OHA's
procedures to distribute those funds.

The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in
10 CFR part 205, subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the
persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount
of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to
fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see

On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Statement of Modified Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August

 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,501 (the Stripper Well Agreement), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will
be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Eighty
percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states
and federal government for indirect restitution.

Shortly after the issuance of the SMRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the Modified Policy
in all subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the Modified Statement
of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited
comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refund
proceedings. The OHA then issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments and setting forth generalized procedures
to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil monies under the subpart V regulations. 52 FR 11737
(April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various States filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that
the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly
calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 10 Notice to the crude oil subpart V proceeding that is
the subject of the present determination. As noted above, $870,000 of an alleged crude oil violation is covered by
this proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount,
or $174,000, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds
to injured parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the
process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined
products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mountain Fuel
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and
prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, a covered product is any product that
was either covered by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760, or if
the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery. See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 23 DOE &para; 88,118, at 88,305 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products,
whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are
presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not
submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price
controls. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15 DOE &para; 85,495, at 88,893&hyph;96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence
which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g., Berry Holding Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 16 DOE &para; 85,405, at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious
doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.

Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury and may not rely on the presumptions of injury
utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometric evidence of the
type employed in the

Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined products will be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund
amount derived by dividing the alleged crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination ($870,000) by
the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000
gallons).

 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund application in the crude oil refund proceedings
need not file another application. That previously filed application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil proceedings
as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application
for Refund from the crude oil funds. See 58 F.R. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund
claims filed within this deadline at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants
that filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we
will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.

Under the terms of the SMRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts
subject to this Decision, or $696,000, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for
indirect restitution. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the
Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements
as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement.

In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 CFR part 205, subpart V, the Economic
Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures
with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on October 7, 1993. The petition requests that OHA formulate and implement
procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to a consent order entered into by the DOE and Telum, Inc.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Telum was a ``reseller-retailer'' of ``covered products'' as those terms were defined in 6 CFR 150.352 and 10 CFR 212.31.
Therefore, Telum was required to price middle distillate fuel in accordance with the price rule of the Mandatory Petroleum
Price Regulations set forth at 10 CFR part 212, subpart F, and antecedent regulations at 6 CFR part 150, subpart L. As
a result of an audit, the ERA alleged that Telum and entities under Telum's direction violated the price regulations
in sales of middle distillate fuel to Salt River Project (Salt River) during a five month period from December 1, 1973,
through April 30, 1974 (the audit period).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The auditors determined that during this period Telum made sales of middle distillates to Salt River at prices in excess
of the maximum lawful selling price (MLSP) permitted by the regulations. Consequently, the ERA issued a Proposed
Remedial Order (PRO) to Telum on May 28, 1980, alleging pricing violations in the sale of middle distillate fuel to
Salt River. After revising its selection of the ``nearest comparable outlet'' with regard to the ``new market'' determination
under 10 CFR 212.111(b), the ERA issued an Amended PRO on September 15, 1986, alleging that Telum had overcharged Salt
River in its sales of middle distillate fuel in the amount of $357,587. On April 7, 1988, that Amended PRO was remanded
by OHA to the ERA, for a new determination regarding Telum's nearest comparable outlet and a recalculation of MLSPs
and any overcharges in sales to Salt River. Telum, Inc., 17 DOE &para;83,010 (1988).

Telum was incorporated as Bonus Oil Company on August 13, 1968. Bonus Oil Company's name was changed to Telum, Inc.
effective December 3, 1974. For the purposes of this Decision, we will refer to the firm only as Telum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other entities under Telum's direction, as listed in the consent order, are: Industrial Fuels, Inc., an Arizona

The ERA did not issue a second Amended PRO. Instead, on May 30, 1990, the DOE entered into a consent order (No. 820H00020Z)
with Telum to resolve all administrative and civil claims related to Telum's compliance with the Federal petroleum
price and allocation regulations in its resale transactions of petroleum products during the period December 1,
1973 through April 30, 1974. Specifically, Telum agreed to remit $60,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in
an interest-bearing escrow account. Telum has remitted $56,149.35 to the DOE, consisting of $51,626.18 toward payment
of the $60,000 principal amount due and $4,523.17 toward payment of interest due on principal. The DOE has authorized
a write-off of the remainder of the amount due for reasons of uncollectability. Telum is no longer in business, and
Earl K. Cook, the former president of Telum, has indicated that he is unable to pay the remainder of the amount due. As
of March 31, 1994, $9,028.85 in interest had accrued in the DOE escrow account on the amount paid by Telum.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines by which the Office of Hearings and Appeals may
formulate and implement a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 CFR
part 205, subpart V. It is the DOE policy to use the subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion
of subpart V and the authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals to fashion procedures to distribute refunds obtained
as part of consent orders, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE &para;82,553 (1982); Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE &para;82,508
(1981); Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981). After reviewing the record in the present case, we have
concluded that a subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the Telum consent order fund.
We therefore propose to grant the ERA's petition and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the fund.

III. Proposed Refund Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Refund Claimant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Insofar as possible, the consent order fund should be distributed to customers of Telum who were injured by the alleged
overcharges. Salt River, the only Telum customer who made purchases during the consent order period that were covered
by the PRO and Amended PRO, is the only Telum customer we have identified as likely to have been injured by the alleged
overcharges. Although we recognize that the Telum consent order covers all sales of ``covered products'' by Telum
for the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974, the ERA audit files, the PRO, and the Amended PRO are all based
only on sales by Telum to Salt River. The consent order, while lacking in specificity, was clearly arrived at in order
to settle this one outstanding enforcement issue. We are thus able to use the information contained in the audit files
for guidance as to the identity of Telum's injured customer and the extent of the alleged overcharges, as we have done
in some prior refund proceedings. See, e.g., Howard Oil Co., 15 DOE &para;85,072 (1986). Consequently, we propose
to establish a claims procedure in which Salt River may apply for a refund of the entire consent order fund. Limiting
the universe of applicants to Salt River allows us to fashion a refund plan that will correspond most closely to the
alleged overcharges settled by the consent order. See Consumers Oil Co., 13 DOE &para;85,226 (1985); Marion Corp.,
12 DOE &para;85,014 (1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In prior refund proceedings, in order to receive a full refund, claimants whose prices for goods and services are regulated
by a governmental body, e.g., a public utility, have not been required to provide a detailed showing of injury. See,
e.g., Dorchester Gas Corp., 14 DOE &para;85,240 at 88,451 (1986). Instead, regulated firms have been required to
(i) certify that they will pass any refund received through to their customers, (ii) provide us with a full explanation
of how they plan to accomplish the restitution, and (iii) certify that they will notify the appropriate regulatory
body of the receipt of the refund. Id. This requirement is based on the presumption that, with respect to a regulated
firm, any overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received
should be passed through to its customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have been informed by Salt River that the nature of its business is that of a municipal public power utility whose
rates for electricity are set by a publicly-elected Board of Directors (i.e., a governmental body). See Memorandum
of April 29, 1994 Telephone Conversation between John Egan, Spokesperson for Salt River, and Andrew Beckwith, OHA
Staff Analyst. We have determined, therefore, that Salt River is a regulated firm as that category is defined above.
See City of Lubbock, 18 DOE &para;85,116 (1988). Accordingly, we propose that Salt River, as a regulated firm, need
not make a showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges. However, Salt River will be required to comply with
the stipulations outlined above that are incumbent upon regulated firms when submitting an Application for Refund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Calculation of Refund Amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, the ERA audit files identify Salt River as the Telum customer injured by the alleged overcharges that
were the subject of the consent order. We propose to pay the entire amount of the consent order fund to Salt River as a
refund for the alleged overcharges. In addition, Salt River will receive all of the interest that has accrued on the
consent order fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salt River should not file a refund application in this proceeding until the issuance of a final Decision and Order.
Detailed procedures for filing an application will be provided in the final Decision and Order. Before disposing
of any of the funds received as a result of the Telum consent order, we intend to publicize the distribution process
and to provide an opportunity for any affected party to submit comments. All comments must be filed within 30 days of
the publication of this Proposed Decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition to publishing copies of the proposed and final Decisions in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, copies of both will be provided to Salt River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Telum, Inc. pursuant to Consent Order No. 820H00020Z, finalized
on May 30, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

FCC Form 740 declaration is submitted to the Commission and U.S. Customs Service upon importation of radio frequency
(RF) devices.

The information collection describes devices being imported that may be harmful to authorized radio frequencies
so that the FCC, with the assistance of Customs, can carry out this responsibility. Examples of RF devices include:
Microwave ovens, virtually any product containing a computer microprocessor, computers and computer peripherals,
telephones with memory or other advanced features, video cameras and recorders, transmitters and transceivers,
most receivers including television receivers, electronic musical instruments, video games, and radio remote
control toys. Rule changes in 1990 reduced the number and types of devices for which the import declaration is required.
Those rule changes also has led to the use of electronic submission of the required information. Because of the effect
of the change to electronic filing, the number of paper forms submitted annually has dropped by an estimated sixty
percent. The information continues to be used by FCC to ensure that radio frequency devices imported into the United
States and its customs territory comply with applicable FCC Rules and Regulations. Information is necessary to FCC/FOB
Enforcement Division, FCC Laboratory and U.S. Customs. Purpose is to keep non-compliant devices from being distributed
to the general public thereby reducing the potential for harmful interference being caused to authorized communications.
When a violation is discovered, the FCC can issue a fine or request Customs to issue redelivery notice to the importer.
If the importer does not redeliver the RF device to Customs, the importer is subject to fines imposed by the U.S. Customs
Service.

Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992 (``Cable-Act'') required the Commission to establish rules to govern rate regulation of cable services
offered by cable systems that are not subject to effective competition. On 2/22/94, the Commission adopted revised
cable rate regulations in a Second Order on reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order and Fifth Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation, wherein we revised rules to implement section 623, subscriber rate regulation.
The new rules became effective on May 15, 1994, and, pursuant to &sect;&sect;76.932 and 76.964 of the rules, cable
systems must give subscribers 30 days notice of any proposed rate change or restructuring made by the cable system.
In connection with these orders, the Commission will conduct a survey on the impact of these new rate regulations.
The purpose of this survey is to determine the effect of our regulations on the rates for regulated cable services since
the 5/15/94 effective date. This survey will be addressed to the largest 100 multiple system operators. Surveying
the largest multiple system operators will permit a review of rate practices under our revised regulations of cable
operators providing a majority of cable service in the United States. The consequences of not conducting this survey
will impair our ability to assess whether our rate regulations have been effective. Respondents will be requested
to submit copies of documentation which verifies subscriber notification, via facsimile, and respond to both written
and telephone inquiries by FCC staff. Any responses may be made by telephone or in written format via facsimile, upon
request by Bureau staff.

<DOCTITLE>Citicorp, New York, New York; Request for an Exemption from Tying Provisions</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Citicorp, New York, New York (Citicorp), has requested, pursuant to section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act
Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C.  1971 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Section 106(b)), that the Board grant an exemption to permit any subsidiary of Citicorp to vary the consideration
charged for mortgage loans based upon the condition or requirement that the customer obtain a loan, discount, deposit,
or trust service from an affiliate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106(b) permits a bank to fix or vary the consideration for extending credit or furnishing services on condition
or requirement that a customer also obtain a traditional banking product (loan, discount, deposit or trust service)
from that bank. However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank from engaging in these same activities on condition that
the customer obtain any additional credit or services from any affiliate. The Board may, by regulation or order, grant
exceptions that are not contrary to the purposes of the section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citicorp contends that its request is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because it is not anticompetitive.
Citicorp argues that the market for mortgage loans is national in scope and highly competitive. In this regard, Citicorp
asserts that it does not have sufficient market power in any relevant market to restrain competition and that the highly
competitive mortgage lending market prevents any mortgage lender from having sufficient market power to restrain
competition in the market or force a consumer to purchase a product on uncompetitive terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Citicorp argues that its proposal is not anticompetitive because customers would not be required either
directly or indirectly to accept one product in order to obtain another product. In this regard, Citicorp states that
all products would be available separately at separate prices and the prices of products would be kept competitive
through normal market forces. Citicorp also claims that customers would be free to choose to purchase combined or
separate services from Citicorp affiliates or from competitors. Finally, Citicorp contends that the proposal would
promote competition and provide public benefits in the form of reduced costs and better service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Citicorp's request is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented
by the request and does not represent a determination by the Board that the request meets or is likely to meet the standards
of Section 106(b). The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than July 5, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only non-profit organizations (including colleges and universities, joint labor-management trust funds, States,
and non-profit government employee organizations) who have experience in the implementation and operation of health
and safety training for lead-based paint abatement workers and supervisors will be considered for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this notice, the term ``lead-based paint abatement activity'' means activities engaged in by
workers that include the removal, disposal, handling, and transportation of lead-based paint and materials containing
lead-based paint from public and private dwellings, public and commercial buildings, bridges and other structures
or superstructures where lead-based paint presents or may present an unreasonable risk to health and safety of the
environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grants made under this program shall be awarded only to those organizations that fund at least 30% of their lead-based
paint training programs from non-Federal sources excluding in-kind contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In-kind contributions are defined as the value of a non-cash contribution to meet a recipient's cost-sharing requirement.
An in-kind contribution may consist of charges for real property and equipment, or the value of goods and services,
directly benefiting the NIOSH-funded project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above stipulations are mandated by section 22(g) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 671(g)),
as amended.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $500,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately four awards. It is expected that the average
award will be $125,000, ranging from $100,000 to $150,000. The awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds.

 Notice is hearby given that a preliminary determination has been made that FY 1993 Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program (LIHEAP) funds are available for reallotment. Section 2607(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), as amended, requires that if the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines that, as of
September 1 of any fiscal year, an amount allotted to a grantee for any fiscal year will not be used by that grantee during
the fiscal year, the Secretary must notify the grantee and publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such funds may be reallotted. As the Secretary's designee, I have determined that a total of $22,591 of FY 1993
funds may be available for reallotment. I have based that determination on reports from the United Tribes of Kansas
and Southeast Nebraska, Inc. (Kansas), Seldovia Village Tribe (Alaska) and the Aroostock Band of Micmacs (Maine)
which were submitted to the Office of Community Services as required by 45 CFR 96.81.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allows grantees who have funds unobligated at the end of a fiscal year to request that they be allowed to
carry over up to 10 percent of their allotments to the next fiscal year. Funds in excess of this amount must be returned
to HHS and are subject to reallotment to other grantees under section 2607(b)(1) of the LIHEAP statute. All of the amounts
described in this notice were reported as unobligated funds in excess of the amount that the three tribes named above
could carry over to FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United Tribes of Kansas and Southeast Nebraska, Inc. were notified by certified mail that $2,384 of its FY 1993
LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. The Seldovia Village Tribe was notified by certified mail that $5,117 of their FY 1993
LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. The Aroostock Band of Micmacs was notified by certified mail that $15,090 of its FY
1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. In accordance with section 2607(b)(3), the Chief Executive Officer of each of
these tribes has 30 days from the date of the letters to submit comments to me. That 30 day period will expire June 16,
1994. After considering any comments submitted, I will notify the Chief Executive Officer of my decision and will
publish my decision in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

If funds are reallotted, they will be allocated in accordance with section 2604 and will be treated as an amount appropriated
for FY 1994.

 Section 602 of Public Law 102&hyph;585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B
of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.''
Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical
pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in which the
manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed the amount determined under
a statutory formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 340B(a)(4) lists the entities eligible to receive discount outpatient drug pricing (i.e., certain disproportionate
share hospitals (DSHs) and PHS grantees). The definition of a disproportionate share hospital found in section 340B(a)(4)(L)
provides criteria to determine which such hospitals are eligible to participate in the program. However, the definition
does not include criteria to determine which outpatient facilities (including off-site or satellite clinics) working
in conjunction with the eligible hospital would be considered part of the hospital for purposes of eligibility for
section 340B drug discounts. The Office of Drug Pricing, which administers this program with PHS, is proposing certain
procedures to determine which outpatient hospital facilities are included as part of an eligible disproportionate
share hospital.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 340B(a)(4) of the PHS Act lists the various groups of entities eligible to receive the section 340B discount
pricing. Section 340B(a)(4)(L)&sect;&sect;
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 describes a subset of ``hospitals'' as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act as eligible to
participate in the program. Because section 1886 addresses Medicare payment for hospital inpatient services only,
the scope of the term ``hospital'' has been limited to the hospital inpatient services. However, section 340B deals
exclusively with outpatient drugs. Although Congress clearly intended that this narrow definition be used to identify
Medicare disproportionate share hospitals which are eligible for section 340B drug discounts, we do not believe
it is reasonable to use this same definition to limit where the section 340B outpatient drug can be used. Some disproportionate
share hospitals offer outpatient services in off-site or satellite outpatient facilities. Further, the movement
of nonprofit hospitals in recent years has been to reorganize and offer a variety of services other than traditional
inpatient hospital services through separate divisions, lines of business, or entities. Therefore, for purposes
of section 340B drug discounts, a more inclusive interpretation of ``hospital'' is needed.

Section 340B(a)(4)(L) of the PHS Act defines as a covered entity_``A subsection (d) hospital (as defined in section
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act) [42 U.S.C. 1396ww(d)(1)(B)] that_(i) is owned or operated by a unit of State
or local government, is a public or private non-profit corporation which is formally granted governmental powers
by a unit of State or local government, or is a private non-profit hospital which has a contract with a State or local
government to provide health care services to low income individuals who are not entitled to benefits under title
XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. section 1395 et seq.] or eligible for assistance under the State plan
under this title; (ii) for the most recent cost reporting period that ended before the calendar quarter involved,
had a disproportionate share adjustment percentage (as determined under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Social Security
Act) [42 U.S.C.A. 1395ww(d)(5)(F)] greater than 11.75 percent or was described in section 1886(d)(5)(F)(i)(II)
of such Act [42 U.S.C.A. 1395ww (d)(5)(F)(i)(II)]; and (iii) does not obtain covered outpatient drugs through a group
purchasing organization or other group purchasing arrangement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) submitted to the Office of Drug Pricing a list of hospitals that met
the first two requirements (i.e., 340B(a)(4)(L)(i) and (ii)). HCFA will update this list periodically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Drug Pricing Program is proposing to recognize as part of an eligible DSH outpatient facilities (including
off-site and satellite clinics) which meet the following standard:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The outpatient facility is considered an integral part of the ``hospital'' and therefore eligible for section 340B
drug discounts if it is a reimbursable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility included on the hospital's Medicare cost report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, if a hospital with one Medicare provider number meets the disproportionate share criteria and this hospital
has associated outpatient clinics whose costs are listed on the Medicare cost report, these clinics would also be
eligible for section 340B drug discounts. However, free-standing clinics of the hospital that submit their own cost
reports using a different Medicare number (not under the single hospital Medicare provider number) would not be eligible
for this benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This test, using the single Medicare provider number, is proposed for three reasons. First, Congress referred to
section 1886 of the Social Security Act, part of the Medicare statute, for the definition of a DSH in section 340B(a)(4)(L)
of the PHS Act. We believe, therefore, that it is reasonable to utilize existing Medicare rules to determine eligibility
for the drug discount program. The proposed Medicare cost report test was developed by Medicare officials and is used,
in part, to determine whether a facility is part of a hospital. If an outpatient facility does not share in the hospital
cost report, it is properly viewed as an independent, free-standing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the relative administrative burden of the proposed test (i.e., obtaining sufficient documentation to verify
the inclusion of these off-site facilities) should be minimal. Hospitals seeking Medicare reimbursement are required
to submit annual cost reports including all hospital units (e.g., on site and off-site clinics); therefore, the information
necessary to determine facility eligibility is available and needs no further analysis by the Office of Drug Pricing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the test incorporates criteria (i.e., the Medicare cost report) that form an independent and objective basis
upon which to determine eligibility. Therefore, this test should provide fair and easy administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If DSHs have difficulty accessing PHS pricing for eligible outpatient clinics, they should contact the Office of
Drug Pricing (not HCFA) for assistance. If manufacturers have questions concerning the eligibility of certain DSH
outpatient clinics, they should also contact the Office of Drug Pricing for a determination of eligibility.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By decision in Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;206, Revision to Accounting and Reporting Requirements for Motor Carriers of
Property, 9 I.C.C.2d 1268 (1994), and published at 59 FR 5110 (2&hyph;3&hyph;94) (Final Rule), we adopted a new and
separate annual report form for class II motor carriers of property, designated as Annual Report Form M&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In our Final Rule, we retained class II annual reporting at a reduced level of detail as compared to the old Annual Report
Form M. Before adoption of the Final Rule, no opportunity for public comment on the content of the Form M&hyph;2 was
provided. For this reason, we are reopening this proceeding on our own motion to provide such an opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write to,
call or pick up in person from: Office of the Secretary, Room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC
20423. Telephone: (202) 927&hyph;7428. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services
(202) 927&hyph;5721.]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We conclude that implementation of our action to seek comments will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Form M&hyph;2 was adopted previously. This notice only affords interested persons an opportunity
to offer comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Form M&hyph;2 contained in this notice will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (5 CFR 1320). Interested persons may direct comments concerning the paperwork
burden and burden estimates of the Form M&hyph;2 to the OMB and ICC by addressing them to:

CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc., 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1101&hyph;8 (water sprinkler system; arrangement of sprinklers) to its Jones
Fork Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;17496) located in Knott County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to use a single overhead
pipe system with 1/2 inch orifice automatic sprinklers located on 10 feet centers to cover 50 feet of fire-resistant
belt or 150 feet of non-fire-resistant belt with actuation temperatures between 200 and 230 degrees fahrenheit with
water pressure equal to or greater than 10 psi. The petitioner states that the sprinklers would be located 10 feet apart
so that the discharge of water will extend over the belt drive, belt take-up, electrical control, and gear reducing
unit. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.

Tilden Magnetite Partnership, P.O. Box 2000, Ishpeming, Michigan 49849 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 56/57.18010 (first aid training) to its Tilden Mine (I.D. No. 20&hyph;00422) located in Marquette County,
Michigan. The petitioner requests that the standard be modified to include Michigan State Certified Emergency Medical
Technicians and First Responders as equivalent to ``selected supervisors'' for the purpose of determining adequate
coverage of trained first aid personnel. The petitioner states that modification of the standard would allow for
the inclusion of those employees that have had advanced training and are currently licensed as Emergency Medical
Technicians or First Responders to be considered as part of the total number of trained first aid personnel and is not
meant to preclude the necessity of training additional members of the work force in standard first aid methods to assure
adequate coverage on all shifts. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least
the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

with the hoistman or a shaft hand that will bell signals to the hoistman; and that when using the radios in the shaft,
methane would be continuously monitored and when 0.5 percent or more of methane is found, use of the radios would be
suspended until the methane level was below 0.5 percent. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method
would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

On December 23, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to limit the Exchange's liability in connection with its administration of proprietary indexes
and products. Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the

The Exchange currently has listed for trading, or has received approval to trade, options on several broad-based
and narrow-based stock indexes.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange represents that there is a great deal of work involved in the daily calculation and dissemination of these
index values and while much of this work is automated, a substantial amount of manual input is still required. Human
error, such as incorrectly inputting a symbol or index value, overlooking a corporate action, or inaccurately reporting
the number of outstanding shares of a component of an index, can occur during the manual input of data which exposes
the Exchange to potential liability. As options on more new indexes are introduced, the chances for human error increase,
thus exposing the Exchange to an even greater risk of liability.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Examples of the broad-based indexes include the Eurotop 100, Institutional, Major Market, and S&amp;P MidCap 400
Indexes. Example of the narrow-based indexes include the Biotechnology, Broker/Dealer, Natural Gas, and Retail
Indexes.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Amex Rules 902C and 1003 disclaim Exchange liability regarding the calculation or dissemination of any
index value, and in the creation, redemption, and trading of Portfolio Depositary Receipts, respectively. These
disclaimers cover errors, omissions, and delays resulting from any conduct beyond the reasonable control of the
Exchange, and include acts of God, power or systems failure, or any error, omission, or delay in the reported price
of an underlying security. The Exchange believes, however, that these disclaimer provisions are arguably ambiguous
with respect to whether the Exchange remains potentially liable for damages caused by any human error or omission
by an Exchange employee in connection with the performance of the Exchange's index responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the increased potential for Exchange liability as a result of the Exchange's expanding role in the administration
of new proprietary indexes and products, the Amex wishes to make clear that in addition to the areas specified in Rules
902C and 1003, the Exchange also disclaims liability for negligent conduct. The Exchange represents that the Amex,
as well as other self-regulatory organizations, currently disclaim liability for negligent conduct associated
with the dissemination of their market data to vendors, as well as generally in connection with the use of their facilities,
except as they otherwise provide. The exchange believes that it is inappropriate for exchanges to bear the risks and
liabilities associated with the use of such information and facilities. In the area of index administration, the
Exchange represents that Standard &amp; Poor's and all the other major index providers likewise routinely disclaim
liability for any negligent conduct.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') has a rule which is substantively similar to the Exchange's
proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the Exchange acknowledges that Rules 902C and 1003 cannot be relied upon by the Exchange to limit its liability
to non-members or for any intentional or negligent violation of federal securities laws.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change provides the Exchange with virtually the same protection
from liability available to the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to NYSE Rule 702(b). Additionally, because the Amex
represents that the proposed rule change cannot be used to limit its liability to non-members arising from negligent
conduct or for any intentional or negligent violation of federal securities laws,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission believes that the proposal may serve to facilitate transactions in securities, while also protecting
investors and the public interest. Specifically, entities such as the Amex may be encouraged to continue to calculate
and disseminate index values so that derivative products based on these indexes, which are found to provide hedging
or other economic functions, will remain available to investors.

In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the fee
increase and discussed any comments it received on the fee increase. The text of these statements may be examined at
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an issuer applies for listing on the Exchange, an original listing fee is levied on the company based on the total
number of shares to be listed. Currently, the fee ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares
to more than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already
have securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers
listed on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50% of the rates for U.S. companies, including the one-time charge,
with maximum of $30,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon discussions with prospect companies, the Exchange believes that each year several large companies elect
not to list on the Amex because the expense of the Exchange's listing fee can become significant at the upper end of the
scale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is therefore proposing to amend section 140 of its Company Guide to provide that the maximum fee applicable
to the original listing of stock issues is $50,000, inclusive of the one-time charge of $5,000. To be consistent, the
Exchange is proposed to reduce the maximum listing fee for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from
$30,000 to $25,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange notes that Nasdaq/NMS original listing fees are roughly comparable to the Exchange's current fees,
although their fees are already capped at $50,000 (also inclusive of a $5,000 one-time fee for new listings).

Amendment No. 1: (1) Clarifies that only one five minute suspension of trading is authorized pursuant to the proposal;
(2) defines who is a ``Post Director;'' and (3) deletes the DPM as one of the persons authorized to impose a temporary
suspension of trading. See Letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite, to Michael Walinskas, Branch

The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 6.3 (``Trading Halts'') to authorize, with respect to a particular class of options,
the Post Director
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 or OBO to suspend trading in the options class for a period of time not to exceed five minutes whenever trading in the
underlying security is halted. This limited authority may be exercised only if the trading halt in the underlying
security is evidenced by an ``ST'' symbol (for an exchange-listed security) or an ``H'' (for a National Market security
traded through the NASDAQ system) appearing on the class display screen that displays current market information
for the underlying security, or if such trading halt is otherwise verified by the senior person in charge of the Exchange's
Control Room. The proposed rule change applies only in the circumstance where there has been a trading halt in an underlying
security, and has no application to ``circuit breaker'' trading halts under Rule 6.3A.

Concurrently with any suspension of trading pursuant to the proposed rule change, the responsible Post Director
or OBO shall turn off the Retail Automatic Execution System applicable to the affected options class or classes. Additionally,
the Post Director or OBO shall disseminate the designation 998&hyph;999 on the Exchange's quote reporting system,
which indicates the option is not trading on the CBOE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the expiration of any temporary suspension imposed pursuant to the proposed rule change, the responsible
Post Director or OBO is required to notify two Floor Officials in order to obtain a determination by them whether a trading
halt in the effected options class should be declared under Rule 6.3(a). If the two Floor Officials determine not to
halt trading, immediately following such determination it shall be announced to the crowd and trading (or a rotation
in the option) shall in no event resume more than five minutes after the temporary suspension of trading was implemented.
The Post Director or OBO may only invoke a single five minute suspension of trading pursuant to the proposed rule change.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5),
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 in that it is designed to protect the mechanism of a free and open market and to protect investors and the public interest.
Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposal will protect investors and the public interest by enabling
Post Directors and OBOs to temporarily suspend options trading promptly in response to verified trading halts in
underlying securities. Pursuant to the current version of Rule 6.3(a), Floor Officials have the authority to halt
trading in any options class for a period not in excess of two consecutive business days if trading in the underlying
security has been halted in the primary market. The proposed rule change, therefore, merely bridges the gap that currently
exists between the time that trading in an underlying security is halted and the time it takes for the Floor Officials
to impose a trading halt in the related options class pursuant to their authority under Rule 6.3(a). Additionally,
a temporary trading suspension pursuant to the proposed rule change can only be invoked once during a single occurrence
of a halt in trading in the underlying security. If two Floor Officials determine not to institute a trading halt pursuant
to Rule 6.3(a), or if a decision is not made by two Floor Officials within the five minute period, trading in the options
class will immediately resume and will continue unless two Floor Officials subsequently independently decide to
invoke a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change protects
investors and the public interest by providing a means for an immediate trading halt in those circumstances where
Floor Officials would be likely to impose a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a). Moreover, because the conditions
under which the five minute halt can be invoked are specific and objective, the Commission does not expect that the
rule change will increase the likelihood of abuse in the implementation of trading halts.

. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 removes the DPM as one of the persons authorized to impose a temporary suspension of
trading. Because the DPM performs market making functions, in addition to having the responsibilities of an OBO,
the Commission believes it would be inappropriate for a DPM to be able to suspend trading in a class of options for any
period of time. Amendment No. 1 also makes certain clarifications to the proposed rule language. The Commission believes
that these clarifications will minimize any potential for confusion as to the application of the rule. As a result,
the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.

In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE proposes to: (1) Establish position limits for options on the Growth and Value Indexes
of 125,000 contracts on the same side of the market, with no more than 75,000 contracts in the series with the nearest
expiration month; (2) establish 225,000 contracts on the same side of the market as the maximum position size that
will be eligible for treatment under the Exchange's hedge exemption rule provisions; and (3) aggregate positions
in Growth Index options and Value Index options for purposes of position and exercise limits, including applicable
hedge exemptions. Additionally, Amendment No. 1 amends proposed Interpretation .01(a)(v) and (vi) to Rule 24.9
to provide that the strike intervals between Growth Index and Value Index options will be no less than $2.50 only if
the strike prices are less than $200.

A. General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to trade options on the Growth and Value Indexes, stock indexes calculated by Standard &amp; Poor's
(``S&amp;P'') (or its designee) and maintained by Barra, Inc. (``Barra'') pursuant to a license agreement between
Barra and S&amp;P. The CBOE also proposes to list long-term options (``Index LEAPS'') on either the full-value of
each Index or reduced-value Growth and Value Indexes that will be computed at one-tenth of the value of the respective
Indexes. Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes will trade independent of and in additional to regular options
on the Indexes traded on the Exchange, however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and
regular options on the Indexes will be aggregated.

B. Composition and Maintenance of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indexes are constructed by sorting the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index on the basis of their book-to-price ratios
as determined by Barra twice per year, based on end-of-day information on November 30 and May 31. Starting with the
company with the highest book-to-price ratio, companies are added to the Value Index until that Index contains 50%
of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The Growth Index is composed of the remaining companies in the
S&amp;P 500 Index. The partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index using November 30 information becomes effective as of January
1 of the following year; the partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index using May 31 information becomes effective July 1 of
the same year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Based on the last partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index, effective January 1, 1994, the Value Index is currently composed
of 310 securities. As of the close of trading on May 3, 1994, the Value Index was valued at 71.65. The market capitalizations
of the individual stocks in the Value Index ranged from a high of $76.05 billion to a low of $97.23 million, with the mean
and median being $5.27 billion and $2.96 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the stocks in the
Value Index was $1.63 trillion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Value Index ranged from
a high of 1.24 billion shares to a low of 8.94 million shares. The price per share of the stocks in the Value Index on that
date ranged from a high of $146.13 to a low of $4.00. Lastly, no one stock comprised more than 4.65% of the Value Index's
total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Value Index accounted for 15.19% of the Index's
value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted stock was 0.01% of the Index and the percentage weighting of
the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 0.05% of the Value Index's value.

respectively. The market capitalization of all the stocks in the Growth Index was $1.60 trillion. The total number
of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Growth Index ranged from a high of 2.30 billion shares to a low of 14.46 million
shares. The price per share of the stocks in the Growth Index on that date ranged from a high of $736.00 to a low of $4.50.
Lastly, no one stock comprised more than 5.12% of the Growth Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the
five largest issues in the Growth Index accounted for 19.47% of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the
lowest weighted stock was 0.03 % of the Growth Index and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the

C. Calculation of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Indexes will be capitalization-weighted, and the methodology used to calculate their
value is identical to the methodology used to calculate the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The level of each Index is
calculated as follows:

The numeric value of each Index was established at 10 as of the close of the market on December 31, 1974.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indexes are calculated continuously by S&amp;P or its designee, and their values will be disseminated by the Options
Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') no less often than every fifteen seconds. S&amp;P will also calculate the exercise
settlement value for each expiring series of Value Index options and Growth Index options, and will make these values
available to CBOE for use by the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') in effecting settlement of exercises and
assignments of the options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values of the Indexes, for purposes of settling outstanding options on the Growth and Value Indexes upon expiration,
will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Indexes' component stocks on the last
trading day prior to expiration.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of each Index will be determined and that value will be used as
the final settlement value for expiring options contracts on that Index. If any of the component stocks do not open
for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the last reported sale price of such security will be used
in any case where that security does not trade on that day.

 Standard options trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. New York time) will apply to the contracts. The multiplier for
each Index will be 100. The strike price interval will be $2.50 for Index options with strike prices of less than $200.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange intends to list up to three near-term calendar months and three additional calendar months at three month
intervals.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 As described in more detail below, the Exchange also intends to list Index LEAPS on each Index that will expire 12 to

Options on each Index (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) will expire on the Saturday following
the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). Because options on the Indexes will settle based
upon the opening prices of the component stocks on the last trading day before expiration (normally a Friday), the
last trading day for an expiring Index option series will normally be the second to the last business day before expiration
(normally a Thursday).

E. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Growth and Value Indexes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange may list Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes that expire 12 to 36 months from date of issuance on
either the full-value of the Growth and Value Indexes or reduced-values of the Indexes that will be computed at one-tenth
the value of the full-value Indexes.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The current and closing values for reduced-value Index LEAPS on the Indexes will be computed by dividing the value
of the full-value Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, a Growth
Index value of 60.54 would be 6.05 for the Growth Index LEAPS and 60.56 would become 6.06. The reduced-value Index LEAPS
on the Indexes will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all
the Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements and floor trading procedures.
The strike price interval for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50.

The same Exchange rules which are applicable to the trading of full-value Index LEAPS on the Indexes will be applicable
to the trading of reduced-value Index LEAPS on the Indexes. For example, both full-value and reduced-value Index
LEAPS may expire from 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance, and there may be up to six expiration months beyond one
year to expiration. Moreover, full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS on either Index may be issued at six month intervals
and new strike prices will either be near or bracketing the current value of each Index. Strike price interval, bid/ask
differential, and continuity rules will not apply to the trading of the full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS on
the Indexes until their time to expiration is less than 12 months.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Lastly, Index LEAPS series on each Index may be added when the value of the underlying Index increases or decreases
by ten to fifteen percent.

Position limits for the options (including Index LEAPS) on the Growth and Value Indexes will be set at no more than 125,000
contracts on the same side of the market, provided that no more than 75,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest
expiration month, and further provided that options positions in the Indexes will be aggregated.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Exercise limits will be set at the same level as position limits.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of calculating applicable position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value options on the
Growth and Value Indexes will be aggregated with each other and with positions in the full-value Index options. For
these purposes, ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract for purposes of aggregating these
positions. Also, CBOE hedge exemption provisions will apply to options and Index LEAPS on both Indexes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has reviewed the proposal to list and trade options and full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS on
the Growth and Value Indexes. As discussed below, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.
In particular, the Indexes are broad-based, the proposed options are designed to reduce the potential for manipulation,
and the proposal to list and trade options and Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes is consistent with the CBOE's
obligation to promote investor protection.

The CBOE is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other
things, coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock
and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the
ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members
on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The
members of the ISG are: the Amex; the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the CBOE; the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; and
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Because of potential opportunities for trading abuses involving stock index
futures, stock options, and the underlying stock and the need for greater sharing of surveillance information for
these potential intermarket trading abuses, the major stock index futures exchanges (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade) joined the ISG as affiliate members in 1990. The Commission
understands that the ISG Agreement, as amended, covers investigations and inquiries regarding trading activity
in options on the Indexes and component securities of the Indexes.

The Commission finds that the trading of options on the Indexes, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS,
will permit investors to participate in the price movements of the securities on which the respective Indexes are
based. Further, trading of options on each Index will allow investors holding positions in some or all of the securities
underlying that Index to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. Accordingly, the Commission, believes
options on the Growth and Value Indexes will provide investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that
should reflect accurately the overall movement of the securities contained in this partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index.
By broadening the hedging and investment opportunities of investors, the Commission believes that the trading of
options on the Growth and Value Indexes will serve to protect investors, promote the public interest, and contribute
to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.

Pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option or warrant proposal
upon a finding that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would
be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits
that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished
public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading
of listed options on the Growth and Value Indexes will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should reflect
the overall movement of securities contained in the Indexes.

The trading of options on the Growth and Value Indexes, including the trading of full-value and reduced-value Index
LEAPS, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance,
and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the DBOE has addressed these concerns
adequately.

A. Index Design and Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the Indexes are broad-based indexes,
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 and thus it is appropriate to permit Exchange rules applicable to the trading of broad-based index options to apply
to options on the Indexes, including Index LEAPS. Specifically, the Commission believes the Indexes are broad-based
because they (1) are a partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index, which is a broad-based index on which options have been approved
for trading since 1983,
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 and (2) reflect a substantial segment of the U.S. equities market.

The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the component
stocks of each Index significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of either Index. First, the Indexes collectively
represent and consist of the common stock values of 500 actively traded U.S. companies. Second, no one particular
stock or group of stocks dominates either Index. Specifically, as of May 3, 1994, no one stock comprised more than 4.65%
of the Value Index's total value or 5.12% of the Growth Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five
largest issues in the Indexes accounted for 15.19% of the Value Index's value and 19.47% of the Growth Index's value.
Third, the market capitalizations of the stocks in the Indexes are very large. Specifically, the market capitalizations
(1) for the Value Index ranged from a high of $76.05 billion to a low of $97.23 million as of May 3, 1994, with the mean and
median being $5.27 billion and $2.96 billion, respectively, and (2) for the Growth Index ranged from a high of $82.09
billion to a low of $506.63 million as of that date, with the mean and median being $8.43 billion and $4.28 billion, respectively.
Fifth, each Index is comprised of stocks representing a diverse group of industries, including, among others, pharmaceuticals,
communications, entertainment, various consumer and computer products and services. Sixth, an overwhelming proportion
of the component stocks in each Index currently are eligible for options trading.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the Commission believes that, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those
securities will help deter as well as detect illegal trading activity involving options on the Indexes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying
an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) The public float must be at least 7,000,000;
(2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million over the preceding
twelve months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three calendar months.

B. Customer Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as options on the Growth and Value Indexes (including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading
of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things;
that: (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating
and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable
to options accounts. Accordingly, because the options and Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes will be subject
to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes
that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in options and Index LEAPS on the Indexes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Surveillance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a
stock index derivative product and the exchanges trading the stocks underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for the surveillance of the derivatives and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''), which currently are the primary markets for all of the component
securities in the Indexes, are members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information.

D. Market Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of options on the Growth and Value Indexes, including
full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 First, as described above, the Indexes are broad-based and each is presently comprised of at least 190 stocks with
no one stock dominating either Index. Second, as noted above, the stocks contained in the Indexes have large capitalizations
and are actively traded. Third, the proposed position and exercise limits, coupled with the requirement that positions
in both Indexes be aggregated, will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Fourth,
the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because the Index options will be issued
and guaranteed by the OCC just like any other standardized option traded in the United States. Fifth, existing CBOE
stock index options rules and surveillance procedures will apply to options on the Growth and Value Indexes.

In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have the
necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of
options and LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes. See letter from Charles J. Henry, President and Chief Operating
Officer, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated January 4, 1993 and
memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, CBOE, dated January 4, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring options on the Growth and Value Indexes (including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is reasonable and consistent
with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing expiring index options for exercise settlement purposes based on
opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on the securities underlying options on
the Indexes.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 maintains the proposed options position limits on the Indexes but requires that positions
in options on the Indexes (including Index LEAPS) be aggregated for purposes of position and exercise limits. As stated
above, the Commission believes that these position and exercise limits have the effect of minimizing the potential
for market manipulation and other adverse impacts on the market for the securities underlying the Indexes as a result
of the trading of options on the Indexes. Amendment No. 1 also clarifies that strike intervals of $2.50 will only be
used for strike prices of less than $200 for full-value options and Index LEAPS on the Indexes. This amendment merely
conforms the proposal to existing CBOE rules.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 index options on the Israeli Index (``Index''). The Index will initially consist of fourteen stocks issued by Israeli
companies, and one American Depositary Receipt (``ADR'')
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 overlying an Israeli company.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 According to the Exchange, no proxy for the performance of the Israeli economy is currently available in the U.S. derivative
markets. Therefore, the Exchange believes, options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating
in the performance of the Israeli economy or to hedge against the risk of investing in that economy.

One of the components of the Index currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange and fourteen (including one ADR representing
11.37% of the weight of the Index as of March 31, 1994) currently are National Market securities traded through the
facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System (``NASDAQ''). The
14 non&hyph;ADR components of the Index are listed for trading only in the United States, and for the ADR component,
more than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for the ADR and the underlying security occurs in the U.S. through
NASDAQ.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Exchange believes that options on the Index should not raise the types of surveillance concerns
that may be raised by options on an index of non-U.S. traded stocks.

As of March 31, 1994, the securities comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $124.11 million
to a high of $2.08 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $566.83 million. The component accounting
for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was Elbit Ltd. (13.12%), while the smallest
was Biotechnology General Corp. (1.92%).

The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the component stocks relative to the base date of
January 2, 1992. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing
by a divisor that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component stock of the Index is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the stock traded will be used in the Index calculation.

The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions.

The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the Israeli economy generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a stock from the Index (generally due
to a takeover or merger), every effort will be made to add to the Index an Israeli stock that is traded in the U.S. and not
in Israel. (According to the Exchange, there are currently 46 Israeli stocks trading in the United States, of which
five are also traded in Israel.) In such circumstances, CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity,
volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement stock. The Exchange will most likely maintain fifteen
stocks in the Index at all times.

The Exchange will notify the Commission of changes in the number of components in the Index. Prior to increasing the
number of components of the Index to more than 20 or decreasing the number of components to less than 10, the Exchange
will be required to submit a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.

In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10th) of the value of the Index. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value
Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced
value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.

 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Israeli Index options. The Exchange states that the proposed
Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last day for
trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date.

Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules regarding narrow-based or industry
indexes will be applicable to Index options. Index option contracts based on the Israeli Index will be subject to position
limits on 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.4A. For purposes of position and exercise
limits Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis. Under the proposal, ten reduced-value
Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAPS for purposes of aggregating positions.
The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new options series that would result
from the introduction of Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS.

On October 15, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to permit the PSE's Options Floor Trading Committee (``OFTC'') to increase, in one or more classes
of multiply-traded equity options, the size of orders eligible for entry into the PSE's Automatic Execution System
(``Auto-Ex'') to the extent necessary to match the size of orders eligible for entry into any other exchange's automated
execution system.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 22, 1993.

 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The PSE subsequently filed Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed
rule change on December 21, 1993, Amendment No. 3 on March 28, 1994, and Amendment No. 4 on May 25, 1994.

Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3, contained various changes to the proposed rule change as originally filed; however, these
changes were withdrawn and superseded by Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change. See Letter from Michael Pierson,
Senior Attorney, PSE, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market Regulation,
Commission, dated May 25, 1994 (``Amendment No. 4''). In Amendment No. 4, the PSE also proposes to adopt Rule 6.87(c)
which would provide that firms entering orders for execution on Auto-Ex may not divide them up in order to make their
parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE proposal adds Commentary .01 to PSE Rule 6.87(a) relating to the operation of Auto-Ex in equity options. Interpretation
.01 would permit the OFTC to increase, in one or more classes of multiply-traded equity options, the size of orders
eligible for entry into Auto-Ex to the extent that other options exchanges permit such larger-size orders in multiply-traded
equity options of the same class or classes to be entered into their own automated execution systems.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal further provides that any such increase in the order eligibility size will be conditioned on PSE's filing
the specific terms of the increase for immediate effectiveness under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The proposal
requires that the PSE include in any such filing, representations that Auto-Ex has the capacity to accommodate the
increase in the order eligibility size. Such representations shall cover systems capacity as well as the market-making
capacity of market-makers participating in Auto-Ex.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Any proposed increase that is initiated by the PSE and not made in response to matching an increase effectuated by another
market would have to be filed with the Commission for review under section 19(b) of the Act.

in orders. Telephone conversation between Michael Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, and Brad Ritter,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the proposal would add Rule 6.87(c) which would prohibit the splitting of orders for purposes of making the
parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex. The Exchange believes this is necessary in order to comply with the purpose
behind the Auto-Ex system which is to allow for the execution of small customer orders. Additionally, when large orders
are split and then routed through Auto-Ex, market makers do not have the opportunity to adjust their markets to reflect
the order flow. Finally, the PSE believes that this provision is consistent with the rule adopted by the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (``CBOE'') regarding orders routed through its Retail Automatic Execution System (``RAES'').

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6 and 11A.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission notes that the proposed rule change is substantively identical to a proposal recently
approved by the Commission relating to RAES at the CBOE.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the rationale supporting approval of the CBOE proposal applies equally to the PSE's
proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation
of the Auto-Ex system provides for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in PSE equity options through the
use of new data processing and communications techniques, thereby improving order processing and turnaround time.

Further, the Commission believes that providing the PSE with an efficient method by which to increase Auto-Ex order
size eligibility to match another market's increase is consistent with sections 6(b)(5) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the
Act in that it facilitates transactions in securities and promotes fair competition among options markets by enhancing
the benefits available to investors of a multiple trading environment. The Commission also believes that the proposal
adequately protects investors and the public interest by conditioning the increase in order size eligibility on
the PSE's filing with the Commission, under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, of the specific terms of the increase.
The Commission believes that requiring the PSE to provide it with such a filing will provide sufficient opportunity
for the Commission to determine whether the PSE has adequate system and market maker capacity to accommodate the proposed
increase and request appropriate modification of the increase if necessary. Finally, the Commission notes that
the PSE has represented that Auto-Ex currently has adequate system and market-maker capacity to accommodate any
reasonably anticipated increase in order size eligibility.

Amendment No. 4 provides that orders may not be split for purposes of making the parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex.
The Commission agrees with the Exchange that this is necessary in order to assure compliance with the purpose of Auto-Ex,
which is to allow for a more efficient method of executing small market and limit orders.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx.

 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

On February 18, 1994, the Phlx amended the proposal: (1) To provide that the Index will be updated during the trading
day at least once every 15 seconds, rather than once every minute; (2) to provide that the exercise prices will be set
at five point Index intervals rather than 2.5 point Index intervals as stated in the original filing; (3) to specify
that the expiration cycle applicable to options on the Index will be three expiration months from the March, June,
September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months; (4) to clarify the Exchange's obligations with
respect to delisting and replacing components of the Index; (5) to clarify that all of the proposed Index's component
stocks are, and any future replacement or added component securities will be, traded either on NASDAQ National Market,
the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or the American Stock Exchange (non-ECM); and (6) to clarify that all of the
current Index component stocks have overlying exchange traded options on them.

complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities comprising the Index (all of which are traded on
the NYSE), also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index; (3) to provide that the Intermarket Surveillance
Group Agreement dated July 14, 1983, as amended on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on
the Index; and (4) to confirm that the trading hours for the Index will be 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. (New York time).

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, proposes to list and trade options on the Phlx Phone Index (``Index''),
an index developed by the Phlx and comprised of eight common stocks representing the companies created as a result
of the divestiture of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. (``AT&amp;T'') in 1983, as well as AT&amp;T itself.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to list for trading an American-style option on the Index. The Index, which
is comprised of the common stocks of the eight companies created as a result of the divestiture of AT&amp;T in 1983,
includes the seven regional telephone companies spun off from AT&amp;T as well as AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T and the spun-off
regional telephone companies represent some of the largest and most widely-held U.S. common stocks. If at any time
the number of stocks comprising the Index increases to more than ten or decreases to less than eight, the Exchange will
submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act prior to opening any new option series on
the Index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Phlx believes that there is a need for an index option that represents solely AT&amp;T and its spun-off regional
telephone companies. In this regard, the Phlx states that there is a significant segment of the investing community
that avidly follows these companies. The Phlx believes that the Index, therefore, would fill a current market void
by creating a pure U.S. telephone industry index that would not be diluted with other telecommunications stocks.

The Index will be calculated using a capitalization-weighting methodology. The value of the Index was set to equal
200 on December 1, 1993. The formula for calculating the Index value is as follows:

The Index divisor will be adjusted for changes in the capitalization of any of the component securities resulting
from mergers, acquisitions, delistings, substitutions, and other like corporate events. The formula for adjusting
the divisor is as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjustments in the value of the Index which are necessitated by the addition and/or deletion of an issue from the Index
are made by adding and/or subtracting the market value (price x shares outstanding) of the relevant issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index value will be updated dynamically and disseminated at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day.
The Phlx has retained Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index
values will be disseminated and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association
and over the facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority. The Index value also will be available on broker/dealer
interrogation devices to subscribers of the option information.

In accordance with Phlx Rule 1009A, if any change in the nature of any stock in the Index occurs as a result of delisting,
merger, acquisition, or otherwise, the Exchange will take appropriate steps to delete this stock from the Index and
replace it with another stock which the Exchange believes would be compatible with the intended market character
of the Index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Index options will be traded pursuant to the current Phlx rules governing the trading of index options, particularly
Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, and generally, Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Index options will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' and will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of

The Phlx will trade consecutive and cycle month series pursuant to Phlx Rule 1101A. Specifically, there will be three
expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months so that the
three nearest-term months always will be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the component securities in the Index currently are eligible to have, and do have, overlying exchange traded
options on them. The Exchange represents that, if at any time less than 90 percent of the component securities, by weight,
are eligible for options trading, the Exchange will submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4
under the Act prior to opening any new series of options on the Index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange represents that surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's
other index options also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. These procedures include having complete
access to trading activity in the underlying securities comprising the Index, all of which are traded on the NYSE.
In addition, the Exchange represents that the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement dated July 14, 1983, as amended
on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on the Index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and with Section
6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate
transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Policy Statement PS&hyph;109, implemented by Regulation ER&hyph;1322 of the Civil Aeronautics Board and adopted
by the Department, established geographic zones of cargo pricing flexibility within which certain cargo rate tariffs
filed by carriers would be subject to suspension only in extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standard Foreign Rate Level (SFRL) for a particular market is the rate in effect on April 1, 1982, adjusted for the
cost experience of the carriers in the applicable ratemaking entity. The first adjustment was effective April 1,
1983. By Order 94&hyph;3&hyph;54, the Department established the currently effective SFRL adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing the SFRL for the two-month period beginning June 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on
the year ended December 31, 1993 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;41 cargo rates may be adjusted by the following adjustment factors over the April 1, 1982

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The International Air Transportation Competition Act (IATCA), Public Law 96&hyph;192, requires that the Department,
as successor to the Civil Aeronautics Board, establish a Standard Foreign Fare Level (SFFL) by adjusting the SFFL
base periodically by percentage changes in actual operating costs per available seat-mile (ASM). Order 80&hyph;2&hyph;69
established the first interim SFFL, and Order 94&hyph;3&hyph;50 established the currently effective two-month
SFFL applicable through May 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning June 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on
the year ended December 31, 1993 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;40 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 18, 1994, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services jointly published a notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 8357) announcing a new finding that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active
workings of a coal mine is exposed can be accurately measured over a single shift in accordance with section 202(f)(2)
of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Based on this finding, the Secretaries are proposing to rescind the
finding issued on July 17, 1971, and affirmed on February 23, 1972, which is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concurrently, MSHA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 8356) announcing its intention to use both single, full-shift respirable dust measurements, and the average
of multiple, full-shift respirable dust samples, to determine noncompliance and issue citations for violations
of the respirable dust standard under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment periods for these notices were scheduled to close on April 19, 1994, but, in response to requests from the
mining community for additional time in which to prepare their comments, MSHA extended the comment period to May 20,
1994 (59 FR 16958). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the public hearing is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions concerning the notices.
The hearing will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA and NIOSH officials. Although formal rules of
evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly
progress of the hearing and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will begin with an opening statement from MSHA and NIOSH, followed by an opportunity for members of the
public to make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion
of the presiding official, speakers may be limited to a maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations. In the interests
of conducting a productive hearing, MSHA and NIOSH will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view
to be heard as effectively as possible.

Rescission of Joint 1971/1972 Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments received to date have reflected some confusion over the MSHA and NIOSH decision to rescind the 1971 Notice
of Finding which was affirmed in 1972. On July 17, 1971, a Notice of Finding under section 202(f)(2) of the Mine Act was
published by the Secretaries of the Interior and Health, Education, and Welfare (36 FR 13286, July 17, 1971). This
finding was based on an analysis of mine operator dust sample results from 2,179 working sections in compliance with
the dust standard. Specifically, the average concentration of all 10 full-shift samples submitted from each working
section under the regulations in effect at the time (referred to as ``basic samples'') ``*&blank;*&blank;* was compared
with the average of the two most recently submitted samples *&blank;*&blank;*, then to the three most recently submitted
samples, then to the four most recently submitted samples, etc.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussing the results of these comparisons, the Secretaries stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* the average of
the two most recently submitted samples of respirable dust was statistically equivalent to the average concentration
of the current basic samples for each working section in only 9.6 percent of the comparisons.'' The finding concluded
that ``[a] single shift measurement of respirable dust would not, after applying valid statistical techniques to
such measurement, accurately represent the atmospheric conditions to which the miner is continuously exposed.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA and NIOSH have concluded that the statistical analysis and the 1971 Finding itself were not germane to the Congressional
intent as stated in section 202(f) of the Mine Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On examination, it can be seen that the conclusion reached in the notice is not consistent with the title of the notice.
Specifically, the title of the notice published in 1971 and affirmed in 1972 states the following: ``Notice of Finding
That Single Shift Measurements of Respirable Dust Will Not Accurately Represent Atmospheric Conditions During
Such Shift''. The conclusion reached in the notice states that: ``*&blank;*&blank;* a single shift measurement
would not, after applying valid statistical techniques, accurately represent the atmospheric conditions to which
the miner is continuously exposed''. Section 202(f) specifies a finding focused on the ``atmospheric conditions
on such shift,'' not the ``atmospheric conditions during which the miner is continuously exposed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis did not address the accuracy of a single full-shift measurement in representing atmospheric conditions
during the shift on which it was taken. Therefore, the 1971/1972 finding does not establish that a single-shift measurement
is invalid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH and MSHA request additional comments on their decision to rescind the joint 1971/1972 finding and issue a new
finding.

Accuracy of Single Full-Shift Measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed joint finding is based on NIOSH and MSHA's position that a sample taken in accordance with the provisions
of 30 CFR parts 70, 71, and 90 accurately represents the full-shift, average atmospheric dust concentration at the
location where the sample is collected. These regulatory provisions were designed to assure that measurements taken
with approved sampling devices in a prescribed manner would meet a level of accuracy acceptable to the Secretaries.
Some commenters suggested that the joint finding was invalid because NIOSH and MSHA had no evidence that a single shift
sample would accurately measure atmospheric conditions as required by section 202(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA and NIOSH request further comments and data from the mining community concerning the accuracy of a single, full-shift
respirable coal dust measurement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 18, 1994, MSHA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 8356) announcing its intention to use both single, full-shift respirable dust measurements and the average
of multiple, full-shift respirable dust samples to determine noncompliance and issue citations for violations
of the respirable dust standard under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concurrently, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services jointly published a notice in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 8357) announcing a new finding that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active
workings of a coal mine is exposed can be accurately measured over a single shift in accordance with section 202(f)(2)
of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Based on this finding, the Secretaries are proposing to rescind the
finding issued on July 17, 1971, and affirmed on February 23, 1972, described in the accompanying notice elsewhere
in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment periods for these notices were scheduled to close on April 19, 1994, but, in response to requests from the
mining community for additional time in which to prepare their comments, MSHA extended the comment period to May 20,
1994 (59 FR 16958). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the public hearing is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions concerning the notices.
This hearing will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA officials. Although formal rules of evidence
or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly progress
of the hearing and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will begin with an opening statement from MSHA, followed by an opportunity for members of the public to
make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion of
the presiding official, speakers may be limited to a maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations. In the interests
of conducting a productive hearing, MSHA will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view to be heard
as effectively as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing
transcripts will be made available to the public for review.

MSHA will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested party,
including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA will be included in the
rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments, the record will remain open until August
5, 1994.

Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date MSHA has received comments from the mining industry on two major issues. The first major issue reflects differing
interpretations of section 202(b) of the Mine Act. Some commenters assume the respirable coal mine dust standard
applies to a long-term average concentration of coal dust. Consequently, they concluded that noncompliance determinations
must take shift-to-shift variability into account. Other commenters maintain that the respirable coal dust standard
applies to the coal dust concentration averaged over a single shift. They concluded, therefore, that MSHA is authorized
to issue a citation whenever the dust standard is exceeded on a single shift, with no allowance made for any shift-to-shift
variability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second major issue involves use of the Values Table, specified in the February 18, 1994, notice, for making noncompliance
determinations with respect to the respirable coal mine dust standard. Several commenters objected to the principle
of citing for noncompliance only when noncompliance is indicated at a high confidence level, claiming that doing
so would effectively result in an increase in the permissible exposure. Other commenters contended that the proposed
values at which a citation would be issued do not sufficiently account for all sources of measurement uncertainty.
MSHA specifically solicits additional comments and data from the mining community on the appropriate values at which
a citation should be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA also requests comments and data from the mining community concerning the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The impact on mine environmental respirable dust levels of using the proposed values for noncompliance determinations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Whether the proposed citation criteria, involving use of both single samples and the average of multiple samples,
will reduce the incidence of overexposures on individual shifts; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Other approaches that could be utilized to detect when the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine
environment is not being maintained below the applicable standard during each shift.
