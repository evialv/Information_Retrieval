SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is amending the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles by removing two footnotes which
identify a particular firm as the source for two items of test equipment specified in the standard. The Commission
has learned that the firm named in the footnote is not the only source of the equipment used to determine if fabrics and
garments comply with the clothing textiles flammability standard. For this reason, the Commission has decided to
remove the footnotes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (16 CFR Part 1610) is applicable to clothing and to textile
fabrics intended for use in clothing. This standard prescribes a test to determine whether clothing and fabrics intended
for use in clothing are dangerously flammable because of ``rapid and intense burning.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Origin of the Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The clothing textiles flammability standard was first published by the Department of Commerce in 1953 as a voluntary
commercial standard designated ``Flammability of Clothing Textiles, Commercial Standard (CS) 191&hyph;53.''
In the same year, Congress enacted the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 (Pub. L. 83&hyph;88, 67 Stat. 111). As enacted
in 1953, and amended in 1954, the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 prohibits the importation, manufacture for sale, or
the sale in commerce of any article of wearing apparel, or any fabric used or intended for use in wearing apparel, which
is ``so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.'' The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 specifies
that the test in CS 191&hyph;53 shall be used to determine if a fabric or article of wearing apparel is ``so highly flammable
as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.'' The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 placed enforcement authority with
the Federal Trade Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1967, Congress amended the Flammable Fabrics Act to expand its coverage to include products of interior furnishing
and wearing apparel made from fabric or related material, and fabric or related material used or intended for use in
products of interior furnishing and wearing apparel. The 1967 amendment authorized the Secretary of Commerce to
issue flammability standards by rulemaking proceedings. Enforcement responsibility remained with the Federal
Trade Commission. The Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended in 1967, is codified at 15 U.S.C. 1191 through 1204. An uncodified
savings clause in the 1967 amendment continued the flammability standard for clothing textiles mandated by the Flammable
Fabrics Act of 1953 in effect until such time as it is amended or superseded in accordance with the procedures specified
by the 1967 amendment. See section 11 of Pub. L. 90&hyph;189, 81 Stat. 568, December 14, 1967. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1972, Congress enacted the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2051 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), which established the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSA also transferred to the Commission the authority
formerly held by the Secretary of Commerce to issue and amend flammability standards, and the authority formerly
held by the Federal Trade Commission to enforce flammability standards. See 15 U.S.C. 2079(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1975, the Commission codified the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 at 16 CFR Part 1609, and the Standard for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flammability of Clothing Textiles at 16 CFR Part 1610. See 40 FR 59931 (December 30, 1975). The Commission's codification
of the flammability standard for clothing textiles included all of the footnotes contained in Commercial Standard
191&hyph;53, as published by the Department of Commerce.

B. Firm Named in Footnotes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4.2 of CS 191&hyph;53 describes an item of test apparatus called the ``flammability tester'' in the following
language: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flammability tester
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.3The Flammability Tester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consists of a draft-proof ventilated chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosing a standard ignition medium, sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rack, and automatic timing device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3This apparatus is manufactured by the United States Testing Co., 1415 Park Avenue, Hoboken, N.J. Blue prints of working
plans for the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this apparatus are available, at a nominal charge, from the above-named firm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4.3 of CS 191&hyph;53 described an item of equipment called a ``brushing device.'' A footnote to section 4.3
states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

These provisions, including the footnotes, are codified at 16 CFR 1610.4(b) and 1610.4(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has received information that similar items of equipment are presently available from several sources.
When CS 191&hyph;53 was first published, a need may have existed to name a specific firm as the source for particular
items of test equipment specified by the standard. However, because more than one firm now supplies the test equipment,
that need no longer exists.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, naming a single firm as the manufacturer or supplier of an item of equipment which is available from
other sources may be unfair to those firms not identified in the footnotes. The Commission has considered the possibility
that the footnotes could be revised to include the names of additional firms which make or sell those items of test equipment.
However, that approach could require periodic revision of the standard to assure that the footnote lists all current
sources for the flammability tester and brushing device. Rather than list all sources of those items, the Commission
has decided to amend the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles by removing footnotes 3 and 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Rulemaking Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requires that agencies must give notice of proposed rulemaking
and provide opportunity for interested parties to submit written comments on the proposal before a rule can be issued
or amended. However, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) provides that notice of proposed rulemaking and public participation are
not required when the agency makes a finding for good cause that such notice and opportunity for comment are ``impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds for good cause that notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for written comment are not
necessary for issuance of the amendment to delete footnotes 3 and 5 from the clothing textiles flammability standard
because that amendment does not affect the rights or duties of any person or firm subject to the requirements of the
standard. The amendment does not change the apparatus, procedure, or criteria used to determine if clothing and textiles
intended for use in clothing are dangerously flammable because of rapid and intense burning. The only purpose of the
amendment is to delete footnotes which identify a single firm as the source of two items of equipment used to conduct
the test specified by the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Impact on Small Businesses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 603) requires agencies to prepare and make available
for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the impact of a proposed rule on small entities,
including small businesses. Section 605(b) of the RFA provides that an agency is not required to prepare a regulatory
flexibility analysis when the agency certifies that the rule will not, if issued, have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with provisions of section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission
certifies that the amendments proposed below, if issued on a final basis, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the amendment does not modify the equipment, test procedure, or pass/fail criteria of the clothing
textiles flammability standard. The amendment will simply remove two footnotes naming one firm as the source for
two items of test equipment. The amendment will not affect the availability of either item of test equipment or increase
or decrease any cost for any firm which manufactures or sells any product subject to the clothing textiles flammability
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Environmental Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments fall within the categories of Commission actions described at 16 CFR 1021.5(c) that have
little or no potential for affecting the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed amendments, if issued on a final basis, will not change any aspect of the testing required by the
standard, the proposed action does not have any potential to produce significant environmental effects. For that
reason, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

Therefore, pursuant to the authority of section 30(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2079(b)) and section
4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1193), the Commission hereby amends title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations,

 In a notice published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 17, 1990 (55 FR 29105), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 9B4171) had been filed by Chugai Boyeki (America)
Corp. (``Chugai'' was inadvertently misspelled in the filing notice as ``Chaugai''), 500 Fifth Ave., suite 1730,
New York, NY 10110. The petition proposed to amend the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of the addition
product of (C

) alkene and propylene to polymethyl hydrogensiloxane for use as a modifier and as an antifoaming agent for polyolefin
resin coatings for paper and paperboard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concluded that the proposed use for the additive
in paper and paperboard coatings is safe. However, based upon a complete review of the petition, the agency has determined
that the appropriate technical effect of the additive is primarily as a polymer modifier, that effect is reflected
in the listing regulation. The agency has further determined that the Chemical Abstracts Service nomenclature and
registry number more accurately describe the additive than the description in the notice of filing, and therefore,
the agency has used them in this rule. Under this nomenclature, the additive is denominated ``Siloxanes (silicones),
dimethyl, isopropyl methyl, methyl 1-methyl-C

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.170) as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before July 28, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65906), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4286) had been filed by Ciba-Geigy

FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe and that &sect;178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 3, 1981 (46 FR 10462), the animal drug regulations were amended to reflect a change of sponsor for certain
NADA's from Hess &amp; Clark, Division of Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., to Hess &amp; Clark, Inc. This sponsor change necessitated
a new entry in 21 CFR 510.600 for Hess &amp; Clark, Inc. However, the February 3, 1981, final rule codified an incorrect
drug labeler code for the firm. This document corrects that error.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Med-Chem Products, Inc., Woburn, MA 01801, has informed FDA that it has transferred ownership of, and all rights and
interests in, approved NADA 122&hyph;578 for Hyaluronate sodium injection to Anika Research, Inc., 160 New Boston
St., Woburn, MA 01801. Accordingly, the agency is amending the regulations in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) and (c)(2) by removing
Med-Chem Products, Inc., because the firm is no longer the sponsor of any approved NADA's, and by alphabetically adding
a new listing for Anika Research, Inc.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to remove those portions of the regulations
that reflect approval of two new animal drug applications (NADA's). One NADA is held by Miles, Inc., and provides for
use of febantel-trichlorfon paste. The other NADA is held by Nutra-Blend Corp. and provides for manufacture of a Type
A medicated article and Type B medicated feeds containing tylosin. In a notice published elsewhere in this issue of

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is adopting a technical amendment to its final rule containing procedures to implement Executive Order 11988
on floodplain management. The final rule requires that documents used in the conveyance of HUD-acquired properties
in a floodplain must refer to uses restricted under Federal, state or local floodplain regulations and include any
land use restrictions under state or local laws. The final rule also requires purchasers of HUD-acquired properties
containing Critical Actions to notify tenants regarding floodplain hazards and flood insurance. The technical
amendment restricts these requirements to the disposition of multifamily properties. HUD is also correcting an
error in a cross-citation within the final rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD published 24 CFR part 55 as a final rule on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19100), with an effective date of May 23, 1994. Part
55 contains procedures implementing Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management (42 FR 26951, May 25, 1977). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 55.22(a) of the final rule requires that in the disposition (including leasing) of properties acquired by
HUD that are located in a 100-year floodplain (a 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action), the documents used for
the conveyance must: (1) Refer to those uses that are restricted under identified federal, state, or local floodplain
regulations; and (2) include any land use restrictions limiting the use of the property by a grantee or purchaser and
any successors under state or local laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 55.22(b) requires that for disposition of properties acquired by HUD that are located in a 500-year floodplain
and contain Critical Actions, HUD shall, as a condition of approval of the disposition, require by covenant or comparable
restriction on the property's use that the property owner and successive owners provide written notification to
each current and prospective tenant, and post an easily visible notice, concerning: (1) The hazards to life and property
for persons who reside or work in a structure in the 500-year floodplain, and (2) the availability of flood insurance
on the contents of their dwelling unit or business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in &sect;55.22(a) were intended to implement Section 3(d) of Executive Order 11988, which applies
to agencies with responsibilities for Federal real property and facilities. However, HUD annually disposes of approximately
65,000 to 70,000 one- to four-family properties acquired as the result of foreclosure or similar means, generally
in connection with a homeowner's default under a mortgage that has been insured by HUD under the National Housing Act.
HUD has determined that application of the requirements in &sect;55.22(a) to the disposition of these one- to four-family
properties would be impractical and unnecessary. Application of the requirement to these properties is impractical
because it would necessitate the research of Federal, state and local restrictions on thousands of properties to
be disposed of within the floodplain each year. These restrictions may be located within building codes, zoning ordinances
or other bodies of law, thus requiring a broad search of various laws and ordinances. The research needed to locate
these provisions for each one- to four-family property would impose an unreasonable burden on HUD resources. In addition,
the requirement is unnecessary, because the Federal, State and local laws and regulations are applicable and enforceable
regardless of whether they are specifically mentioned in conveyance documents. The vast majority of such acquired
properties will already contain an existing residential structure, so that any legal restrictions will generally
apply only to additions to the structure or a change in use; in any case, the owner will generally need to obtain a building
permit or other local government approval for any improvements or additions to the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, HUD has determined to amend &sect;55.22(a) to apply these requirements only to the disposition of multifamily
properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements contained in &sect;55.22(b) with regard to notification of tenants in properties containing Critical
Actions (such as hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities that are likely to contain occupants with mobility
difficulties) are not expected to be applied to one- to four-family properties, since it is unlikely that one- to four-family
properties will contain critical actions. However, to avoid confusion on this issue, HUD is amending &sect;55.22(b)
to clarify that the requirements of that paragraph apply only to the disposition of multifamily properties that contain
Critical Actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Finally, HUD is correcting an inadvertent error in a cross-citation within part 55. Section 55.12(b)(2) refers to
the definition of ``substantial improvement''. The citation to that definition is corrected to refer to &sect;55.2(b)(8)
rather than &sect;55.12(b)(9).

On September 27, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 50303). The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In years past, the Coast Guard has provided a safety zone on the Cape Fear River in Wilmington, North Carolina, for several
annual events. The fireworks are generally launched during the annual 4th of July celebration, and on the first Saturday
of October each year during the Riverfest celebration. The launching of commercial fireworks constitutes a potential
safety hazard to the people, vessels, and property in the vicinity. This safety zone is needed to protect the public
from the potential hazards near the fireworks display and to insure a smooth launching operation. It will consist
of an area of water 200 yards wide and 667 yards long.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only one comment was received. The Commentor objected to safety zones in general and did not offer alternatives except
for not enacting a safety zone or reducing the size. Because of the past experiences with fireworks displays, the zone
is needed. Based on those same experiences and the fireworks used in the displays, the size of the zone is the minimum
necessary to protect the public and Coast Guard officers patrolling the zone from unacceptable risks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential cost and benefits under 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments made suggesting any impact to small entities. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule consistent with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B (National Environmental Protection Act), and actions to protect the public safety have been
determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

As directed in the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress adopted
the rules and regulations of the Tribunal that were found in 37 CFR chapter III on an interim basis with only technical
changes. It later issued revised rules and regulations. The Office failed to amend one of the existing Copyright Office
regulations and also erred in several sections of the revised interim regulations. The Office is making only technical
changes to correct those errors.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (Reform Act).
Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;198. Effective immediately upon enactment, the Reform Act amended the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.,
by eliminating the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and transferring its responsibilities and duties to ad hoc copyright
royalty panels, to be administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. The copyright royalty panels
will be convened by the Librarian of Congress for limited times for the purpose of adjusting rates and distributing
royalties collected under the compulsory licenses of the Copyright Code. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 118, 119, and Chapter 10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Reform Act eliminated the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and directed the Librarian of Congress to adopt immediately
the rules and regulations of the Tribunal in their entirety. We adopted the Tribunal's regulations with certain technical
amendments as interim regulations on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67690). In one part of these interim regulations we changed
the terms ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal'' wherever they appeared to ``copyright arbitration royalty
panels and/or Librarian of Congress''. We did not change any references to the Tribunal in our own regulations at that
time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 9, 1994, we issued interim regulations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 23964) amending the interim regulations we had adopted on December 22, 1993. In the amended regulations of May
9, 1994, we made errors in &sect;&sect;253.8(e); 255.3(g)(1); 259.1; 259.2, 259.3(d)(e)(f); and 259.4(a)(b)(d).
In the December 22, 1993, amendments, we had changed the designations ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal''
to ``copyright arbitration royalty panels and/or Librarian of Congress''. We failed to recognize all of these changes
when we revised the interim regulation on May 22, 1994, and inserted ``Copyright Office'' in some sections. However,
instead of amending the existing terms ``copyright arbitration royalty panel and/or Librarian of Congress'' we
made these amendments to the already deleted terms ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal'' or ``CRT''.
This document will correct the errors found in the May 9, 1994, document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, we did not earlier amend &sect;201.16 (a) and (b)(3)(iii) of our regulations to add ``the former'' in front of
Copyright Royalty Tribunal in &sect;201.16(a) and change ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' to ``copyright arbitration
royalty panels and/or Librarian of Congress'' in &sect;201.16(b)(3)(iii). This rule is issued as a final rule for
&sect;201.16 (a) and (b)(3)(iii) and a correction of the document of May 9, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States containing CO nonattainment areas with design values of 12.7 ppm or less were required to submit, among other
things, contingency measures to satisfy the provisions under section 172(c)(9). These provisions require contingency
measures to be implemented in the event that an area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date, December
31, 1995. Contingency measures were due by November 15, 1993, as set by EPA under section 172(b) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contingency measures must be implemented within 12 months after the finding of failure to attain the CO National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Once triggered they must take effect without further action by the state or EPA, therefore,
all contingency measures must be adopted and enforceable prior to submittal to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAAA does not specify how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emission reductions they must
provide if an area fails to attain the CO NAAQS. EPA believes that one appropriate choice of contingency measures would
be to provide for the implementation of sufficient vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions or emissions reductions
to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT while the state revises its SIP to incorporate all of the new requirement
of a serious CO area.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, EPA is approving Oregon's SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 for Grants Pass, Medford,
Portland and Klamath Falls, Oregon because it meets the applicable requirements of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Oregon held public hearings in Grants Pass, Medford, Portland and Klamath Falls on August 16, 17, and 18,
1993 respectively to entertain public comment on the CO contingency measure SIP revision. Following the public hearing,
the plan was adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission on October 29, 1993, and became effective on November
4, 1993. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) submitted the plan to EPA on November 15, 1993 as a proposed
revision to the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal
was found to be complete and a letter dated March 8, 1994 was forwarded to ODEQ's Director indicating the completeness
of the submittal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of State Submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Oregon's CO contingency plan requires oxygenates to be supplied at maximum allowable oxygen contents (e.g. 3.5%
ethanol and 2.7% methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)). A specified minimum average oxygen content level of 2.9% would
be required only if, in subsequent control seasons, the projected control area average oxygen content would be less
than 3.1%. This projection will be based on reported oxygenate mix information submitted by the regulated community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any of Oregon's four CO nonattainment areas fail to meet applicable standards by the December 31, 1995 Clean Air
Act (CAA) deadline, or in any subsequent year prior to redesignation to attainment, implementation of the contingency
provision will be formally triggered by written notification to ODEQ from the EPA, or by written notification from
ODEQ to affected fuel suppliers in order to give as much lead time as possible to implement the CO contingency plan for
the 1996&hyph;97 CO season. Oxy-fuel suppliers will be provided at least eight months to implement CO contingency
plans from the time notification is received from ODEQ or from EPA, whichever is sooner. ODEQ would expect to notify
suppliers no later than March 1 in order to ensure that oxy-fuel is supplied for the entire winter CO season. EPA is legally
required to make such notification within six months of the end of calendar year 1995. If a standard violation occurs
during 1994, the above implementation time frame could be accelerated by as much as two full years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the CO contingency plan is triggered and oxygenates are being supplied at maximum EPA approved levels, ODEQ
will assess seasonal oxygenate mix reports to project whether an average control area oxygen content of 3.1% will
be reached in subsequent control periods. If ODEQ's projection indicates that the oxygen content will be less than
3.1%, a 2.9% mandatory average oxygen content to be achieved by all Control Area Responsible Parties (CARs) and blender
CARs, will be implemented for future control periods. If mandated, a 2.9% oxygen content level could be achieved by:
(a) Using only ethanol as an oxygenate; or (b) through an averaging program using MTBE or other oxygenates and ethanol.
An averaging program would require that at least 25% of the total volume of fuel supplied to a control area be oxygenated
with ethanol to meet an oxygen content of 3.5%. The remaining 75% of total volume could be oxygenated with MTBE or other
oxygenates at a 2.7% level to yield an average oxygen content over the control period of 2.9%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recently promulgated regulations for reformulated gasoline that control the oxygen content of gasoline under
section 211(c)(1) of the Act in certain ozone nonattainment areas, 59 FR 7716 (February 16, 1994). Since the reformulated
gasoline program would not apply to the gasoline marketed in the Oregon CO nonattainment areas at issue here, EPA does
not believe that Oregon's contingency measures to impose controls on oxygen content beyond those statutorily required
under section 211(m) would be preempted under section 211(c)(4) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the CO contingency plan, the revision contains housekeeping changes to clarify and improve the organization
of the oxy-fuel regulations to minimize misinterpretation. EPA approves of these changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. The
action will become effective on August 29, 1994 unless adverse comments are received by July 28, 1994. If the EPA receives
adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on the proposed rule (please see short informational notice published, simultaneously, in the proposal
section of this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 29, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25431), EPA issued a proposed rule that on its own initiative and pursuant to section 408(e) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), EPA proposed a time-limited tolerance for residues
of imidacloprid on dried hops at 3.0 parts per million (ppm). EPA recently reclassified dried hops as a raw agricultural
commodity (59 FR 9167; Feb. 25, 1994 and 59 FR 17487; April 13, 1994). EPA is establishing the tolerance because it has
granted a petition for an emergency exemption under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act, 7 U.S.C. 136p, for the use of imidacloprid on hops in the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; imidacloprid
is used in other countries that export hops to the United States; and the database for imidacloprid is relatively complete.
The most significant data gap for establishing a permanent tolerance for imidacloprid on dried hops is a third field-residue
trial. Given the relatively low risks presented by imidaclorprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will
significantly change EPA's risk assessment. Nevertheless, EPA is establishing a 1-year time limitation on this
tolerance for a full residue data base to be available in making a decision on a permanent tolerance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the time-limited tolerance will protect
the public health. Therefore, the time-limited tolerance is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is deleting barium sulfate from the category ``barium compounds'' on the list of toxic chemicals for which reporting
is required under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). This action
is based on EPA's conclusion that barium sulfate meets the deletion criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(3). By promulgating
this rule, EPA is relieving facilities of their obligation to report releases of barium sulfate that occurred during
the 1993 reporting year, and releases that will occur in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is issued under section 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of
1986 (42 U.S.C. 11023). EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) of 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106, ``PPA''). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals
to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may
petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added chemicals to and deleted chemicals
from the original statutory list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions.
On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual
members of the section 313 metal compound categories. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action becomes effective immediately. Thus, the last year in which facilities had to report releases of barium
sulfate was 1993, covering releases that occurred in 1992. The effect of this deletion is that, since barium sulfate
will not be on the section 313 list when facilities report in 1994 for releases that occured in 1993, these reports and
all subsequent reports need not include barium sulfate release data. Facilities will therefore not have to collect
release information for any releases of barium sulfate that occur during the 1993 reporting year or for any releases
that occur in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 313(d)(4) provides that ``[a]ny revision [to the section 313 list] made on or after January 1 and before December
1 of any calendar year shall take effect beginning with the next calendar year. Any revision made on or after December
1 and before January 1 shall take effect beginning with the calendar year following the next calendar year.'' The Agency
interprets this delayed effective date provision to apply only to actions that add chemicals to the section 313 list.
For deletions, the Agency may, in its discretion, make such actions immediately effective. An immediate effective
date is authorized, in these circumstances, under 5 U.S.C. section 553(d)(1) since a deletion from the section 313
list relieves a regulatory restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the purpose behind the section 313(d)(4) effective date provision is to allow facilities
adequate planning time to incorporate newly added chemicals to their TRI release data collection processes. A facility
would not need additional planning time to not report releases of a given chemical. Thus, a reasonable construction
of section 313(d)(4), given the overall purpose and structure of EPCRA _ to provide the public with information about
chemicals which meet the criteria for inclusion on the section 313 list _ is to apply the delayed effective date requirement
only to additions to the list. Where the Agency has determined, as it has with barium sulfate, that a chemical does not
satisfy the criteria of section 313(d)(2)(A)-(C), no purpose is served by requiring facilities to collect release
data or file release reports for that chemical, or, therefore, by leaving that chemical on the section 313 list for
any additional period of time. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that 313(d)(4) was intended to apply to
deletions as well as additions; indeed, such a construction would be incongruous, since deleted chemicals, by definition,
do not satisfy the criteria for being on the section 313 list and their deletion from that list should not be delayed
in the absence of any compelling reason to the contrary. This construction of section 313(d)(4) is also consistent
with previous rules deleting chemicals from the section 313 list. Indeed, the Agency has not given any of its rules
deleting chemicals from the section 313 list the delayed effective dates specified in section 313(d)(4).

III. Description of Petition and Rationale for Delisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Petition and Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 24, 1991, EPA received a petition from the Chemical Products Corporation (CPC) to delete barium sulfate
(BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from the list of toxic chemicals established under EPCRA section 313. A second petition, submitted by the Dry Color
Manufacturer's Association (DCMA), to delete barium sulfate was received on November 6, 1991. Both petitions are
based on the contention that barium sulfate is not toxic and does not meet any of the statutory criteria under EPCRA
section 313(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the petitions, EPA granted the petitions and issued a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32622), to delete barium sulfate from the category ``barium compounds'' on the list of toxic
chemicals under EPCRA section 313. EPA's proposal was based on its conclusion that BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(3) criteria for deletion from the list. With respect to deletions, EPCRA section 313(d)(3)
provides that ``[a] chemical may be deleted if the Administrator determines there is not sufficient evidence to establish
any of the criteria described in paragraph [(d)(2)(A)-(C)].'' Specifically, in the proposal EPA preliminarily
concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to establish that BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 causes adverse acute human health effects, chronic human health effects, or environmental toxicity. EPA's rationale
is detailed in the proposed rule and is based on the Agency's review of the petitions, as well as other relevant materials.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Rationale for Delisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing comments received and other relevant information, EPA has concluded that the assessment set out
in the proposed rule should be affirmed. Therefore, this final rule is based on EPA's conclusion that BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is essentially non-toxic to humans and the environment, and thus meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(3) criterion for
delisting (i.e., it does not meet any of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) listing criteria). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching this conclusion, EPA considered the toxicity of the barium ion because another potential source of barium
sulfate toxicity could be from the barium ion. EPA initially analyzed the availability of barium ion. If the ion is
not available, barium sulfate cannot cause toxicity due to barium ion. EPA has concluded that barium ion from barium
sulfate will not be available to humans or the environment in any way that would affect the Agency's decision under
EPCRA section 313(d)(3). This is because barium ion from barium sulfate will occur at significant levels only under
anaerobic conditions in stagnant water bodies that are cut-off from surface and ground waters. As discussed below,
such conditions do not give rise to human health or environmental concerns under the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because intact BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is acutely toxic only at levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures, BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause ``. . .significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration
levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous, or frequently
recurring releases.'' EPA believes that barium ion anaerobically released from barium sulfate into isolated stagnant
water bodies cannot reasonably be anticipated to result in adverse effects on human health because people do not routinely
use these waters as sources of drinking water or food, or for recreation. Under other conditions, barium ion could
not be an issue because it is not available. Thus, EPA has concluded that BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not meet the toxicity criterion for listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) because BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer, developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity,
gene mutations, or chronic toxicity. Intact BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not known to cause such effects, and for the reasons discussed above barium ion will not be available to cause chronic
human toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that BaSO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) toxicity criteria because of the lack of availability of soluble barium
from barium sulfate. Moreover, ecotoxicity data indicate that barium ion generated in low sulfate, anaerobic environments
cannot reasonably be anticipated to result in adverse effects on the environment of sufficient seriousness to warrant
reporting under EPCRA section 313.

C. Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received 34 comments on the proposed rule, all in support of the deletion of barium sulfate. While all the comments
received were in support of the deletion, a few commenters requested clarification on some points discussed in the
proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters wanted clarification of the statement regarding the water solubility of barium sulfate and how it
relates to the maximum contaminant level (page 32624, second column, first full paragraph). EPA agrees with the commenters
that, at the water solubility of 2.4 mg/L (2.4 ppm) at 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, there are 1.4 ppm of barium ion and 1.0 ppm of sulfate ion, and that the 1.4 ppm concentration of barium ion is
below the maximum contaminant level of 2 mg/L (2 ppm) established by EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters requested clarification of EPA's characterization of the regulatory status of barium sulfate under
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the disposal of drilling fluids. Specifically, one commenter
stated that EPA did not clarify that discharges of drilling fluids are in fact exempt from EPCRA as well as RCRA. Another
commenter stated that EPA should clarify the statement in the proposed rule that there are no Federal regulations
prohibiting land disposal of drilling fluids to include the possibility of state regulations. EPA agrees with the
commenters that some clarification is needed on these issues. 40 CFR 261.4(b)(5) exempts from Federal regulation
as hazardous waste drilling fluids and other wastes from the exploration, development, or production of crude oil,
natural gas, or geothermal energy. Therefore, EPA regulations do not prohibit the land disposal of drilling fluids.
This activity, however, may be regulated by state agencies. In addition, the commenter added that underground injection
controls pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program
under the Clean Water Act also regulate drilling waste. EPA does not agree with the comment that disposal of drilling
fluids is totally exempt from EPCRA reporting. Although the discharge of drilling fluids is not specifically reportable
under EPCRA section 313, the drilling fluids may contain a reportable component and the discharge of that chemical
would require reporting if all applicable criteria are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter wanted clarification of the statements ``Although the TCLP may indicate that barium sulfate is not
a hazardous waste as defined by RCRA. ..'' and later, ``Furthermore, drilling fluids are specifically exempted and
are not considered hazardous wastes under RCRA including those containing barium sulfate, even if the barium sulfate
itself meets the TCLP (40 CFR 261.4)'' (page 32624, column 1, second and third full paragraphs). To clarify, barium
sulfate is not a listed hazardous waste as defined by RCRA. Furthermore, the exemption under 40 CFR 261.4(b)(5) for
barium sulfate in drilling fluids may apply. EPA notes that barium is one of the contaminants tested for in the Toxicity
Characteristics (TC) of 40 CFR 261.24. However, due to its limited water solubility, barium sulfate is not expected
to produce an extractable concentration of barium that exceeds the maximum allowable concentration of soluble barium
(100 mg/L) using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) as described in 40 CFR 261.24. Thus, in these
cases, land disposal of barium sulfate is not regulated under RCRA subtitle C. However, EPA reiterates that the TCLP
is not conducted under anaerobic (reducing) conditions and that it is possible for barium sulfate to liberate soluble
barium under such conditions. Thus, even though land disposal of barium sulfate is permissible under RCRA if TC levels
for barium are not exceeded, such disposal may lead to the availability of soluble barium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter claimed that throughout the proposal EPA placed too much emphasis on the release of barium ion from barium
sulfate under anaerobic conditions. In addition, the commenter added that it is unlikely that disposal of drilling
fluids as solid wastes would ``encourage perched water and anaerobic digestion of barium sulfate in low sulfate environments.''
In the proposed rule EPA wanted to make clear that although barium sulfate is poorly soluble (i.e., does not significantly
dissociate to barium and sulfate ions) in water, it is still possible for this substance to liberate barium ion in water
as a result of anaerobic degradation. In the proposed rule EPA cited several studies which clearly show that barium
ion concentrations can become elevated as a result of anaerobic degradation of barium sulfate. EPA agrees with the
commenter that it is probably unlikely that discharge of barium sulfate-containing drilling fluids will encourage
the formation of stagnant waterbodies, where anaerobic degradation is likely to occur. In its discussions on the
availability of barium ion from barium sulfate (units IV.D. and E. of the proposed rule) the Agency did not specifically
address discharges of drilling fluids containing barium sulfate. Although EPA cited studies that showed elevated
barium ion concentrations in experiments which used drilling fluids that contained barium sulfate, the main purpose
of these discussions is to illustrate that under certain environmental conditions barium ion can become available
from barium sulfate, regardless of the source of the barium sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated in the proposal that EPA does not clearly make the distinction that barium is not a heavy metal
(page 32626, column 3, first full paragraph). EPA agrees that barium is not a heavy metal, and it is not EPA's intent
to imply that barium is or can be viewed as a heavy metal. EPA was describing how the solubility of barium sulfate may
be influenced by factors other than sulfate concentration. EPA used references which describe how substances normally
found in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids, bicarbonate, and hydroxyl ions) or soil particle grain size
can enhance the solubility of otherwise poorly soluble metal salts, such as salts of heavy metals. EPA maintains that
the cited studies provide sufficient evidence that the solubility of any metal salt may be significantly affected
by a variety of naturally occurring environmental conditions. The same commenter provided additional information
on the toxicity of barium ion. EPA is considering this information but is not addressing it in this final rule since
it is not relevant to this delisting. In accordance with the May 23, 1991 guidance, this delisting decision is made
on the basis of availability of barium ion and not on barium ion toxicity. If the ion is not available, its inherent toxicity
is irrelevant because it cannot cause adverse effects. Today's action is not intended, and should not be inferred
to affect the status of BaSO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this final rule is not ``significant'' and
therefore not subject to OMB review.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether
a substantial number of small entities would be significantly affected by the final rule. Because this final rule
eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is revising the language of the Prohibition of the Manufacture, Importation, Processing, and Distribution in
Commerce of Certain Asbestos-containing Products; Labeling Requirements Rule (also known as the Asbestos Ban and
Phase Out or ABPO Rule) in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to conform to a court decision that vacated and remanded
part of the ABPO Rule and to an EPA factfinding conducted in accordance with the court's decision. The ABPO Rule prohibited
the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing products
in three stages over 7 years beginning in 1990. On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit (the court) vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. In a subsequent clarification, the court said the rule
continued to govern asbestos-containing products that were not being manufactured, imported, or processed on July
12, 1989. EPA conducted a factfinding and concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories in the ABPO
Rule were not being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. This
document revises the CFR to conform to the findings of EPA in accordance with the court decision, and requires no notice
and public comment.

 of July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29460), EPA issued a final rule under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15
U.S.C. 2605) that prohibited the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing
products in three stages over 7 years (40 CFR 763.160 through 763.179). Stage 1 of the ban went into effect in August
1990. Stages 2 and 3 were scheduled to go into effect in 1993 and 1996 respectively.

in the rule that may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported when the rule was published on July 12,
1989. In addition, EPA solicited information on the commercial status of any other product category in the ABPO Rule
that also may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989. EPA supplemented the original
information in the RIA with the comments received in response to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 5, 1993 (58 FR 58964), that announced its findings concerning the regulatory status of the product categories
in the ABPO Rule. EPA concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories were not being manufactured, processed,
or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. The remaining product categories were being manufactured,
processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and are no longer subject to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA is issuing this document to revise the language of the ABPO Rule in the CFR to conform to the October
1991 court decision that remanded the rule and to the November 1992 factual findings of EPA, in accordance with the
court decision.

(a) Persons who are subject to the prohibitions imposed by &sect;&sect;763.165, 763.167, or 763.169 may file an application
for an exemption. Persons whose exemption applications are approved by the Agency may manufacture, import, process,
or distribute in commerce the banned product as specified in the Agency's approval of the application. No applicant
for an exemption may continue the banned activity that is the subject of an exemption application after the effective
date of the ban unless the Agency has granted the exemption or the applicant receives an extension under paragraph
(b)(4) or (5) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Application filing dates. (1) Applications for products affected by the prohibitions under 763.165(a) and 763.167(a)
may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applications for products affected by the ban under 763.169(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted
or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applications for products affected by the ban under 763.165(b) and 763.167(b) may not be submitted prior to February
27, 1995. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied
by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 25, 1995, will
be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Applications for products affected by the ban under &sect;763.169(b) may not be submitted prior to February 26,
1996. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 26, 1996, will be either granted or denied
by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 26, 1996, will
be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Agency will consider an application for an exemption from a ban under &sect;763.169 for a product at the same
time the applicant submits an application for an exemption from a ban under &sect;763.165 or &sect;763.167 for that
product. EPA will grant an exemption at that time from a ban under &sect;763.169 if the Agency determines it appropriate
to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the Agency denies an application less than 30 days before the effective date of a ban for a product, the applicant
can continue the activity for 30 days after receipt of the denial from the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Agency fails to meet the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section for granting or
denying a complete application in instances in which the deadline is before the effective date of the ban to which the
application applies, the applicant will be granted an extension of 1 year from the Agency's deadline date. During
this extension period the applicant may continue the activity that is the subject of the exemption application. The
Agency will either grant or deny the application during the extension period. The extension period will terminate
either on the date the Agency grants the application or 30 days after the applicant receives the Agency's denial of
the application. However, no extension will be granted if the Agency is scheduled to grant or deny an application at
some date after the effective date of the ban, pursuant to the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this
section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where to file. All applications must be submitted to the following location: TSCA Docket Receipts Office (7407),

&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If the application does not include all of the information required in paragraph (d) of this section, the Agency
will return it to the applicant as incomplete and any resubmission of the application will be considered a new application
for purposes of the availability of any extension period. If the application is substantially inadequate to allow
the Agency to make a reasoned judgment on any of the information required in paragraph (d) of this section and the Agency
chooses to request additional information from the applicant, the Agency may also determine that an extension period
provided for in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is unavailable to the applicant.

The Fish and Wildlife Service confers designated port status on Boston, Massachusetts pursuant to section 9(f) of
the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The direct importation and exportation of fish and wildlife, including parts
and products, will now be permitted through Boston, Massachusetts. Under this final rule, Boston, Massachusetts
will be added to the list of Customs ports of entry designated for the importation and exportation of wildlife. A public
hearing on this proposal was held on December 8, 1993, in the Massachusetts Port Authority, Maritime Department,
Fish Pier East II, Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02210.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Designated ports are the cornerstone of the process by which the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) regulates the
importation and exportation of wildlife in the United States. With limited exceptions, all fish or wildlife must
be imported and exported through such ports as required by section 9(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C.
1538(f). The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for designating these ports by regulation, with the approval
of the Secretary of the Treasury after notice and the opportunity for public hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 4, 1974, the Service promulgated a final rule designating eight Customs ports of entry for the importation
and exportation of wildlife (39 FR 1158). A ninth port was added on September 1, 1981, when a final rule was published
naming Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas a designated port (46 FR 43834). On March 15, 1990, a final rule was published naming
Portland, Oregon as the tenth designated port of entry (55 FR 9730). An eleventh port was added on May 20, 1992, when
the final rule was published naming Baltimore, Maryland as a designated port (57 FR 21355).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Containerized air and ocean cargo has become the paramount means by which both live wildlife and wildlife products
are transported into and out of the United States. The use of containerized cargo by the airline and shipping industries
has compounded the problems encountered by the Service and by wildlife importers and exporters in the Boston area.
In many instances, foreign suppliers will containerize entire shipments and route them directly to Boston. If, upon
arrival, the shipment contains any wildlife, those items must be shipped under Customs bond to a designated port for
clearance. In most cases, this has involved shipping wildlife products to New York, New York, the nearest designated
port, but reshipment has been both time consuming and expensive. To alleviate this problem, Boston importers and
exporters have attempted to direct entire shipments, even though they contain only a small number of wildlife items,
to a designated port prior to their arrival at Boston. This method of shipment meets the current regulatory requirements
of the Service; however, it is again time consuming and entails additional expense. It is also contrary to the increasing
tendency of foreign suppliers to ship consignments directly to regional ports such as Boston. In addition, time is
a key element when transporting live wildlife and perishable wildlife products. Without designated port status,
business in Boston cannot import and export wildlife products directly, and consequently may be unable to compete
economically with merchants in other international trading centers located in designated ports. With airborne
and maritime shipments into and out of Boston steadily increasing, the Service has concluded that the port should
be designated for wildlife imports and exports. Conferring this status on Boston serves not only the interests of
business in the region, but will also facilitate the mission of the Service in two ways. First, clearance of wildlife
shipments in Boston will relieve inspectors at the port of New York who are now handling cargo for both ports. Second,
it will eliminate the need for the administrative processing of permits by the Regional office that are issued to Boston
area importers who are able to qualify for those permits on the basis of demonstrated economic hardship. Also, Boston's
growth as a major east coast port of entry combined with modernization of shipping routes, make it an essential commercial
link to the New England area.

Results of Public Hearing and Written Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), requires that the public be given an opportunity
to comment at a hearing prior to the Secretary of the Interior conferring designated port status on any port. Accordingly,
the Service held a public hearing on November 8, 1993, from 9 a.m. to 12 Noon. The hearing was held in the Massachusetts
Port Authority, Maritime Department, Fish Pier East II, Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Seven persons
presented oral and/or written testimony at the hearing, representing Maritime Department at the Massachusetts
Port Authority, Advance Brokers, Boston Customs Broker and Freight Forwarders Association, Tower International,
International Cargo Systems, and Liberty International. Most of the witnesses stated that shipping to New York or
another designated port for inspections when small numbers of wildlife items are involved is detrimental to the economic
well being of their clients. They felt that designation would allow their companies and their customers to become
more competitive on both time and cost. The Boston Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association had reviewed
port inspection statistics and felt that the volume of shipments in Boston justifies designated port status as they
are larger than some currently designated ports. International Cargo Systems, is a freight forwarder whose primary
business involves seafood, is anticipating a 30 percent increase in business if Boston becomes a designated port.
Liberty International complained about the application process necessary to obtain a designated port exception
permit. In their opinion, it is so time consuming that many potential importers will not deal in wildlife products
simply to avoid the delays. The witnesses felt that designated port status would increase the numbers of potential
users at the port of Boston.

One additional written comment submitted by MONITOR, on January 10, 1994, was received by the Service during the public
comment period. The commenter opposed the designation of Boston as a port of entry because in the commenter's opinion
the designation of a twelfth port for the importation and exportation of wildlife would spread the staff and finances
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service even thinner, diminishing the Service's effectiveness in wildlife law enforcement.
The Service believes that this rule will not have a negative impact on other wildlife enforcement efforts nor reduce
the detection of illegal shipments elsewhere by the placement of a wildlife inspector at Boston.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service also receives requests for wildlife identification assistance from other Federal Agencies such as U.S.
Customs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (APHIS) at Boston and Canadian border ports. While many of these locations
are not part of the designated port area, it is important for wildlife inspection services to be available at such major
international facilities when the need arises. This also relieves the burden of Service Special Agents in the Boston
area who must take time from other investigational priorities to address inspection needs. This is particularly
important during the migratory bird hunting season as waterfowl resource protection in the regional flyway is a priority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Department
of the Interior (Department) has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). As discussed above, opening Boston as a port of entry will have a slight economic benefit to the Boston area businesses.
This action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630. This rule does
not contain any additional information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This action does not contain any federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. These final rule changes
in the regulations in Part 14 are regulatory and enforcement actions which are covered by a categorical exclusion
from National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 516 Department Manual and an Environmental Action Memorandum
is on file at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Arlington, Virginia. A determination has been made pursuant
to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act that this revision of Part 14 will not effect federally listed species.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 is 12,505 metric tons (mt), as established by
the 1994 final specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) and modified in accordance with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 11,800 mt, and has set aside the remaining 705 mt as bycatch to support
other anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance
has been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 63 is prohibited, effective from
12 noon, A.l.t., June 22, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., July 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;672.20(g).

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The FFEL Program
regulations govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal SLS)
Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as the Federal
Family Education Loan Program. The Federal Stafford Loan, the Federal SLS, the Federal PLUS and the Federal Consolidation
Loan programs are hereinafter referred to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs. The final regulations
incorporate statutory changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of
1992 (the 1992 Amendments), self-implementing provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA),
and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (1993 Technical Amendments). Regulations needed to implement
other OBRA amendments and the 1993 Technical Amendments will be published separately. The final regulations also
reflect various policy initiatives intended to improve program administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Stafford, SLS, and PLUS Loan programs provide loans to eligible student or parent borrowers who might otherwise
be unable to finance the costs of postsecondary education. The Consolidation Loan Program gives borrowers an opportunity
to consolidate loans made under the Stafford loan, Perkins (formerly National Direct Student Loan), Auxiliary Loans
to Assist Students (as in effect before October 17, 1986), PLUS, SLS, Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Professions Student Loan (HPSL), and the Higher Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 16, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 12484). Those proposed regulations were developed in compliance with section 492 of the 1992 Amendments (Pub.
L. 102&hyph;325), mandating that the regulations be submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. Regional meetings
were held during September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of the proposed regulations and a
negotiated rulemaking process was conducted during January and February 1993. The NPRM published on March 16, 1994
provided an indepth discussion of those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus as reflected in those regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, improve their capacity
to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school and to
pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. The student
aid programs also enable current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic and technologically

that an on-time payment is one received by a guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days of the scheduled due date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 71 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive
issues and significant technical changes are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous comments were received to the effect that the proposed regulations did not reflect OBRA or the 1993 Technical
Amendments changes and suggested that the Secretary publish a revised notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) indicating
which sections were superseded by subsequent changes in law. Other than those provisions that are self-implementing
and are reflected in this package, the Secretary will issue regulations to implement most substantive provisions
from OBRA and the 1993 Technical Amendments in a separate rulemaking package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary also notes that technical corrections to the regulations governing the FFEL Program were published

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the commenters noted, OBRA amended the HEA to end the SLS program effective July 1, 1994. However, the Secretary
does not agree with the commenters that references to that program should be removed from these regulations. SLS loans
will remain outstanding for many years after the program ends and the regulations need to reflect the requirements
relating to those loans. However, the Secretary revises the regulations to make reference to the SLS program as in
effect prior to July 1, 1994.

Commenters suggested that the Secretary delete the reference to parent PLUS loans made on or after October 17, 1986
because the statutory use of this term was ended by the 1993 Technical Amendments. The commenters also suggested that
the reference to a requirement that a borrower must consolidate at least $7500 in eligible student loans in the Consolidation
Loan Program be deleted to reflect the elimination of this requirement by OBRA. The commenters noted that this change
needs to be reflected in other sections of the regulations.

The Secretary agrees that the regulations could be interpreted to indicate that the borrower's entire obligation
to repay a debt may be forgiven for borrowers performing certain public service. However, section 428J of the HEA only
authorizes the Secretary to repay limited portions of certain Federal Stafford loan obligations for individuals
who enter certain specified teaching and nursing professions or perform certain other national and community service.
Moreover, the loan forgiveness program is a demonstration program which is not currently funded.

: Some commenters suggested that in the definition of ``disposable income'' the reference to ``any amounts required
by law to be withheld'' was unclear and recommended further clarification. The commenters noted, for example, that
child support payments would qualify under this definition if the payments were made under a divorce settlement rather
than a court order. The commenters believed that the Department should not treat borrowers who are subject to garnishment
for private debts more favorably than borrowers who are making payments without the need for court intervention.

from an employer and other income from any source that remains after the deduction of amounts required by law to be withheld

written agreement. The Secretary has also revised the definition to exclude payments made under a wage garnishment

: Some commenters expressed the same opinion raised during the negotiations that requiring aid officers to certify
the student's estimated eligibility for the Federal Perkins loan or Federal Work-Study program regardless of whether
the student applies for the aid is not reasonable. Some commenters believed that it is unjust to penalize a student
who declines campus-based awards and that it is inappropriate to have the financial aid administrator determine
what is an ``acceptable reason'' for declining aid.

: After further consideration of the commenter's views, the Secretary agrees that financial aid officers should
not be required to certify estimated eligibility for other aid that the student does not apply for or consider as estimated
financial assistance aid offered but declined by the student. The Secretary believes that students and their families
should have discretion in those areas not prescribed by law and that aid administrators should not be placed in the
position of evaluating the merits of a student's reason for declining an award. The Secretary notes that this position
is consistent with Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Some commenters stated that they understood that the Secretary had agreed during the negotiated rulemaking process
to permit a 13-year repayment schedule to be established for a borrower who chooses to repay a loan under an income-sensitive
repayment schedule. The commenters also suggested that the definition be revised to incorporate the 10-year repayment
requirement for variable rate interest loans. The commenters suggested that the 10-year repayment period be extended
in the case of an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also pointed out that during negotiated rulemaking, the Department agreed that in the case of the PLUS
and SLS loans with a variable rate, the lender could use the rate at the time the loan entered repayment for purposes
of establishing the initial repayment period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: During the negotiations the Secretary repeatedly made it clear that he had no authority to extend the 10-year repayment
period provided by statute. The Secretary did agree to authorize a three-year forbearance period in the case of an
income-sensitive repayment schedule and agreed to allow forbearance for a period of up to one year in the case of a variable
interest rate loan or graduated repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary noted that these extensions have the practical effect of extending the repayment period to eleven or
thirteen years. The Secretary is developing final regulations to the NPRM published on March 24, 1994 that addresses
extending the period of forbearance in cases where the repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment
term of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a lender should use the variable interest rate at the time the loan entered
repayment for purposes of establishing the initial repayment period. If the repayment schedule leads to balloon
payments or increased payments, and the borrower is unable to make those payments, the lender may grant forbearance,
which is excluded from the 10-year period.

noted that it should be clear that the delay in the repayment of an SLS is not a period of deferment or forbearance and,
as such, special documentation is not required. The commenters also suggested that, since &sect;682.202(c) permits
capitalization during grace periods if provided for in the promissory note (and the addendum and common applications
provided for this capitalization), the Secretary should clarify that the lender may capitalize interest during
this period.

: While a number of commenters supported a uniform standard for determining ``satisfactory repayment arrangements''
for defaulted borrowers, many commenters objected to the use of the proposed uniform standard for all purposes, including
reinstatement of Title IV eligibility for defaulted borrowers, rehabilitation of defaulted student loans, and
consolidation of defaulted student loans. The commenters believed that use of the proposed standardized definition
to qualify a borrower for rehabilitation and consolidation is not in the FFEL Program's best interest. Although the
commenters supported a standard definition of the term ``satisfactory repayment arrangements'', they did not view
the proposed definition as adequate. Commenters believed that it did not adequately recognize the increase in payments
once the loan has been rehabilitated or consolidated and that it did not provide for more lenient treatment based on
the borrower's individual circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Secretary notes that for purposes of rehabilitation and reinstatement of borrower eligibility, the statutory
language does not provide flexibility in establishing the number of payments to regain eligibility or rehabilitate
a defaulted loan. In regard to Consolidation loans, the 1993 Technical Amendments amended section 428C of the HEA
to refer to ``arrangements satisfactory to the holder.'' The Secretary does not believe that this language was intended
to conflict with the statutory requirement in section 432 of the HEA that common procedures be established or the need
to ensure that similarly situated borrowers be treated fairly. In light of these considerations and the other comments
received on this provision, the Secretary has determined that three consecutive monthly payments will be required
for a borrower to consolidate a defaulted loan. The Secretary believes the making of three consecutive monthly payments
would allow a borrower to initiate loan consolidation and add the defaulted loan to the consolidation loan within
the 180-day provision provided under section 428C(a)(3)(b)(II) of the HEA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that defining ``on-time'' to be making a payment within 15 days of the scheduled due date
is a new condition that could not have been anticipated by guarantors, servicers and lenders making good faith efforts
to program their systems to handle loan rehabilitation. Some commenters suggested that ``on-time'' be revised to
mean a payment made within the calendar month. Other commenters suggested that ``on-time'' be revised to be a payment
received by the guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days. The commenters suggested that a guaranty agency is aware
of the date on which payments are received. Using the term ``made'' could be interpreted to mean the date on which the
check was issued by the borrower, or the post-mark date, etc.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes that it is critically important for borrowers who have previously defaulted and who are entering
into satisfactory repayment arrangements with a guaranty agency to establish a pattern of monthly payments that
are made timely. For this reason, the Secretary does not agree that an ``on-time'' payment should be one that is made
anytime during the calendar month. The Secretary also notes that the kind of latitude provided by a payment deadline
that is anytime within the calendar month will not be available to the borrower if the loan is rehabilitated subsequently
and is then serviced by a lender or lender servicer. The Secretary also believes there is sufficient time for guaranty
agencies to reprogram their systems prior to the July 1, 1995 effective date of these regulations. The Secretary agrees
with the commenters who suggest that the on-time standard should be based on when payments are ``received'' rather
than ``made'' because a guaranty agency or its agency is aware of this date and the word ``made'' is open to several different
interpretations.

 Some commenters suggested that the addition of a definition of ``reasonable and affordable'' would impact the collection
of defaulted loans. The commenters suggested that, based upon the definition provided, each time a guaranty agency
changed the monthly payment amount the agency would have to go through the process of determining what is reasonable
and affordable. The commenters further suggested that a guaranty agency's collection agents or attorneys will also
be subject to conducting the same review whenever they attempt to reach a repayment arrangement.

 The Secretary believes that this definition will not have an impact on the collection of defaulted loans. This provision
applies to voluntary payments the borrower is making after the borrower specifically initiates voluntary payment
to reinstate eligibility, rehabilitate, or consolidate a defaulted loan. These requirements do not relate to other
routine changes the guaranty agency makes to monthly payment amounts.

 Commenters suggested that borrowers, whose loans are non-dischargeable and who have not filed a hardship petition,
should be allowed to have their Chapter 12 or 13 plan payments count toward regaining eligibility for FFEL loans. The
commenters suggested that these borrowers are not attempting to have the loan discharged and, as such, are making
voluntary payments.

 During negotiations, the Secretary agreed with certain negotiators that a uniform standard for ``write-off'' was
desirable for guaranty agencies to use in determining what constitutes a ``write-off'' in determining whether a
borrower has an adverse credit history. The applicable standards referenced in the definition refers to the Write-off
and Compromise Procedures which the Department of Education is now developing in consultation with the Department
of Treasury, in accordance with the Treasury financial manual and OMB A&hyph;129. The Secretary does not consider
a loan that has been discharged under section 437(c) of the Act (language in the preamble incorrectly referred to 437(b))
to be considered a write-off nor does the Secretary intend to require borrowers to reaffirm those loans to receive
additional aid under the FFEL program.

must be the other parent of the student for whom the loan is made. These commenters pointed out that the Secretary has
issued policy guidance for the FFEL Program that would permit a creditworthy nonparent to be an endorser on the Federal
PLUS application of a non-creditworthy parent borrower and that this would be in keeping with the provisions of the
Federal Direct Loan Program.

 Several commenters expressed a concern that lenders be permitted to exercise ``professional judgment'' in determining
whether to make a Federal PLUS loan in spite of an initial finding of adverse credit. They stated that the lender should

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

valid documentation of extenuating circumstances to a new credit report, a statement from the creditor, or a statement
from the borrower in the event of a debt less than $500.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These commenters were addressing two different but related issues in their comments. The first issue addresses lender
flexibility in determining whether to make a loan when the initial credit report includes indicators of adverse credit.
The second issue relates to the documentation needed by a lender when making a determination that extenuating circumstances
exist and determining to make the PLUS loan based on that determination. The NPRM, as written, states in &sect;682.201(b)(7)(iii)
that ``Unless the lender determines that extenuating circumstances existed, the lender must consider each applicant
to have an adverse credit history *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This provision specifically gives the lender the flexibility
to determine that some cases involve extenuating circumstances that would provide a legitimate criterion for PLUS
loan approval. The NPRM further states that the lender must retain documentation demonstrating its basis for determining
that extenuating circumstances existed and that the documentation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
include an updated credit report, a statement from the creditor that the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements
to repay the debt, or a satisfactory statement from the borrower explaining any delinquencies with outstanding balances
of less than $500. The use of the word ``may'' indicates that there could be other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the lender would deem sufficient to override the adverse credit determination.

 Some commenters believed that the definition of adverse credit is too restrictive. The commenters believed that
allowing one account that is 90 days past due to prohibit borrowing when the parent may have ten other accounts that

history have no more than an

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 This issue was discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. While the statute does not include the ability to repay a PLUS loan
as an eligibility criterion, a lender is not prohibited from maintaining a lending policy that would examine parental
ability to repay in determining whether to make a loan. However, once the lender has decided to make a loan, the lender
has no authority to reduce the statutory limit provided under the PLUS program.

 A few commenters expressed concern about confusion resulting from slightly different wording in Dear Colleague
Letter 93&hyph;L&hyph;159, dated September 1993, and the NPRM regarding interpretation of the wording in the proposed
regulation that ``*&blank;*&blank;* the applicant is considered 90 or more days delinquent on the repayment of a
debt.'' The DCL indicated that one criterion for having adverse credit is that the applicant is considered 90 days
or more delinquent on the repayment of a debt ``on the day of the lender's examination of the credit report.'' This was
interpreted by some commenters to mean that the lender must extrapolate delinquency based on the date of the credit
report and the date on which the lender examined that report.

 The Secretary believes that the lender's option of applying the extenuating circumstances criterion would permit

The commenter correctly pointed out that while default has been defined for purposes of the FFEL Program, its definition

 Some commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to specifically allow for the delivery of a lump sum or master
check from a lender to a school that can be placed in an account of the school, as with electronic funds transfer, and
credited to an individual student's account.

 The Secretary agrees that the regulations should allow for delivery of loan proceeds by means of a lump sum check. This
change recognizes the acceptance by the Department of the ``master check'' concept as provided in earlier guidance.

 The regulations have been revised to permit the disbursement of loan proceeds by ``master check'' for a number of borrowers
in addition to an individual check for each borrower. The definition of ``disbursement'' has also been revised to
include the transfer of loan proceeds by a master check that represents loan amounts for more than one borrower.

 A commenter suggested that the Secretary expand the regulations to provide that a student enrolled in a foreign school
have the option of having the loan proceeds delivered to the student or to the foreign school. The commenter suggested
that the regulations apply to students studying abroad for credit at the home school and appear to exclude students
enrolled in a foreign school who are not studying for credit at the home school.

this option.

 Several commenters suggested that the use of the word ``disbursement'' as it relates to the limitations on interest

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,

 issuing of loan proceeds by the lender, rather than interpreting it to mean ``delivery'' of loan proceeds to the borrower

 As noted in the preamble to the NPRM of March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12489), the Department's interpretation of Congress' use
of the word ``disbursement'' in this context and its applicability to the interest limitation provision were thoroughly
discussed during negotiated rulemaking. However, as a result of discussions with the negotiators, the Department
agreed to proposed regulatory language that would achieve the statutory intent while developing a schedule for lender
billing of interest on the more easily documented disbursement date. The term ``disbursed'' as it is used in &sect;682.300(c)
refers to the traditional use for issuance of funds by the lender. The interest limitation provisions are then applied
depending on whether the loan proceeds are disbursed by the lender before or after the first day of the period of enrollment
for which the loan is intended.

The Secretary does not believe that an agency can assess a borrower's total financial circumstances to determine
a reasonable and affordable payment amount without examining documentation from the borrower. The Secretary does
not believe that the documentation requirements contained in the regulations are onerous. The Secretary believes
that submission of a monthly budget statement on a guaranty agency prepared form and some proof of current income are
minimal requirements. The Secretary believes that a statement of the unpaid balance of all of a borrower's FFEL loans
is necessary only if the guaranty agency does not already have this information. The Secretary has no objection to
the borrower submitting this documentation via facsimile technology.

Many commenters were strongly opposed to the reference to the $50 payment in proposed &sect;682.401(b)(4)(i)(B)
in regard to the requirement that the guaranty agency document the borrower's file if the borrower's reasonable and
affordable payment is determined to be less than $50. The commenters believe that agencies are using the reference
to $50 to justify their denial of payments of less than $50.

The Secretary expects a guaranty agency to make a determination of what constitutes a ``reasonable and affordable''
payment amount on a case-by-case basis after examining financial information from the defaulted borrower who requests
reinstatement of eligibility for federal student financial assistance. The proposed rule clearly stated that $50
may not be the required minimum payment for a borrower if the agency determines that a smaller payment amount is appropriate
based on its examination of the borrower's total financial circumstances. An agency is prohibited from establishing
$50 or any other amount as a required minimum threshold payment amount in lieu of the appropriate reasonable and affordable
payment based on the borrower's total financial these circumstances. The reference to $50 in the regulations is intended
by the Secretary to be a documentation standard for guaranty agencies. A guaranty agency is required to document its
determination of a borrower's reasonable and affordable payment only if the payment is less than $50.

Some commenters expressed concern that consideration of a spouse's income in the determination of reasonable and
affordable payments may be in violation of the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The commenters noted that the
spouse is not liable for the other spouse's individual debt and, therefore, consideration of the secondary spouse's
income may not be considered in determining a monthly reasonable and affordable payment. The commenter suggested
that clarification must also be made in this section that disclosure of child support and/or alimony payments is voluntary,
consistent with the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

The Secretary believes that, for a borrower with dependents, examining only the borrower's income and expenses may
not reveal the borrower's true financial circumstances. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act relates to the application
for credit. The determination of reasonable and affordable payments in connection with reinstatement of eligibility,
rehabilitation or meeting conditions for consolidation does not relate to the application for credit. See 12 CFR
Part 202.

Some commenters supported the regulations that provide a guaranty agency the authority to establish reasonable
criteria for an institution to participate in the guaranty agency's program. However, many other commenters strongly
objected to this provision. The objecting commenters suggested that in &sect;682.401(b)(6)(i), the Secretary
allows a guaranty agency to determine that an institution does not satisfy the standards of administrative capability
and financial stability standards as defined in 34 CFR Part 668 and believed that the Secretary is making the guaranty
agencies enforcers of the set of administrative capability and financial responsibility standards. The commenters
believed that this structure is entirely outside of the statute and clearly ignores the program integrity triad as
mandated under the new Part H (Program Integrity) of the HEA with a particular role for each part of the Triad. The commenters
suggested that if the Triad is to be successful, the responsibilities contained in the statute must be clearly set
forth in regulations with no vagaries concerning responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters noted that in the General Provisions NPRM, the Secretary proposed to provisionally certify an institution
that does not currently meet the standards of administrative capability but is expected to meet those standards in
a reasonable period of time. The commenters suggested that under the March 16, 1994 NPRM, a guaranty agency could deny
participation to these institutions, including an institution with a cohort default rate of 20% or greater. The commenters
believed that it is the Secretary's role to ensure that institutions meet appropriate standards of administrative
capability and financial responsibility and believed the Secretary does so by certifying institutions. The commenters
suggested that if the institution has been certified, the guaranty agency should be required to rely on that certification
unless and until the Secretary uses his authority to revoke that certification. The commenters suggested that a guaranty
agency provided this improper delegation of authority may well have an incentive to retaliate against certain institutions
as a result of their filing of appeals of their cohort default rates. The commenters suggested that appeals of cohort
default rates, especially appeals alleging servicing error, may directly or indirectly challenge the integrity
of the guaranty agency and may have the economic effect of removing certain loans from being eligible for federal reinsurance.
The commenters further suggested that because of the clear possibility of conflict of interest, it is irrational
to allow guaranty agencies to effectively terminate the participation of institutions in Title IV programs. The
commenters asserted that in contrast to a State Postsecondary Review Entity (SPRE), an accreditation agency or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department, a guaranty agency is not an impartial adjudicator of these issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary understands that a guaranty agency is not a member of the Program Integrity Triad authorized under Part
H of the HEA and that the Triad has imposed a new management structure on the oversight of schools participating in the
Title IV student assistance programs. However, the Secretary believes that the statute continues to provide a guaranty
agency with oversight authority for schools applying to or continuing to participate in its guaranteed loan program
and disagrees that the regulations provide an improper delegation beyond the scope of statutory authority. Section
428(b)(1)(V) provides authority for the guaranty agency to require a participation agreement between the agency
and the school as a condition for the agency guaranteeing loans for students attending the school. As part of that process,
the Secretary believes that a guaranty agency must be permitted to establish standards that are consistent with the
standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 CFR 668 for a school's participation
in its guaranteed loan program. The Secretary believes that a guaranty agency should be allowed to protect itself
from schools that abuse the FFEL program. Generally, a guaranty agency must assume that a school that the Secretary
has found to be eligible is eligible. However, because the agency's examination of a school for participation in its
program may take place a significant period of time after the Secretary's examination of the school for certification,
the Secretary understands that the agency may uncover information relevant to the school's administrative capability
and financial responsibility that it wishes the Secretary to consider before signing a participation agreement
with the school. Subject to the Secretary's agreement that such information indicates the school's failure to meet
the standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 CFR 668, the agency may
decline to establish a participation agreement with the school. The Secretary believes this authority provided
to a guaranty agency does not intrude upon the statutory responsibilities of other members of the Triad. The Secretary
also notes that the guaranty agencies have long had responsibility for reviewing schools and have specific statutory
authority in section 428(b)(1)(T)(ii)(I) for limiting, suspending, or terminating a school from the FFEL program.
The Secretary believes that these regulations are consistent with the agency's statutory authority and longstanding
Department policy and regulation. Additionally, the Secretary does not believe that this regulatory authority
would provide an agency with the opportunity to retaliate against a school as a result of a school's appeal of its cohort
default rate. Such an appeal presumes that a school already participates in the agency's program. The statute authorizes
an agency to initiate an emergency action, limitation, suspension or termination (LST) of an eligible institution,
but provides that the action must be undertaken pursuant to criteria, rules, or regulations issued under the student
loan insurance program which are substantially the same as regulations issued by the Secretary. Further, an emergency
action or LST is subject to review by the Secretary. Therefore, the Secretary does not believe that the guaranty agency
can use its authority to retaliate against a school as the commenter suggests.

A number of commenters objected to the provision that gives a guaranty agency the authority to limit the total number
of loans or the volume of loans made to students attending a particular school, or to otherwise establish appropriate
limitations on the school's participation in the agency's program where the agency has determined that a school does
not satisfy the financial responsibility and administrative capability standards. The commenters suggested that
this inappropriately places responsibility for evaluating a school's administrative and financial responsibility
in the hands of the guaranty agency. Some commenters objected to applying this provision to schools that are renewing
an application to continue to participate. Some commenters suggested that allowing guaranty agencies to limit the
participation of schools that seek to renew participation gives guaranty agencies an easy way to retaliate against
institutions that appeal their cohort default rates or take other actions that challenge the guaranty agency.

to students attending a particular eligible institution during any academic year. The Secretary notes that there
must be a legitimate basis for the agency to impose such a limitation. The Secretary expects a guaranty agency to maintain
evidence of the school's questionable administrative capability.

due process rights to the institution.

Section 428(b)(1)(T)(ii)(I) provides authority to a guaranty agency to limit, suspend, terminate (or take emergency
action against) a school based on the Secretary's regulations or regulations of the guaranty agency that are substantially
the same as regulations issued by the Secretary. The statute further directs the Secretary to apply the limitation,
suspension, or termination proceeding to all locations of those schools unless the Secretary finds, within 30 days
of the guaranty agency's notification to the Secretary of the action, that the action did not comply with the statute
and regulations. To make this finding, the Secretary reviews the guaranty agency's actions under section 428(b)(1)(T)(ii)

 A few commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to provide that the guaranty agency provide schools that
request information under this paragraph an appropriate number for borrower inquiries if the assignee of a loan uses
a lender servicer, rather than the number of the lender. The commenters pointed out that many lenders use servicers
to address loan inquiries. The commenters suggested that these lenders do not staff their offices to address borrower
inquiries, or maintain on-line access to borrower information. Inclusion of the assignee's number will flood these
offices with calls, frustrating the intent of providing the borrower with loan information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than until the date the Secretary rejects the appeal. The commenter noted that the guaranty agency should be
protected for LLR loans made in the brief period between the date that the Secretary rejects the appeal and the date
that the guaranty agency is aware of the rejection and ceases origination activities. The commenter suggested that
the regulations as currently written would appear to cause these ``interim'' loans to be uninsured.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that a defaulted borrower be afforded only one opportunity to benefit from an agency's
loan rehabilitation program. The commenters believe that a borrower who defaults again subsequent to rehabilitation
is not likely to be a good candidate for loan rehabilitation.

 The Secretary points out that pursuant to section 428F(a)(1)(A) of the HEA, a borrower may request to have a defaulted
loan rehabilitated and after the borrower has made 12 consecutive monthly payments, the guaranty agency must, if
practicable, sell the loan to an eligible lender. Once a borrower's loan is rehabilitated, the borrower is no longer
considered to be in default on the loan and regains eligibility for all program benefits. Section 428F(b) of the HEA
allows a borrower with one or more defaulted loans to regain eligibility for Title IV student financial assistance
after the borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments. The Secretary notes that section 428F(b) was amended
by the 1993 Technical Amendments to specifically permit borrowers to receive this benefit only once. However, no
such limitation was placed on the benefits of rehabilitation. In determining whether rehabilitation is practicable,
a guaranty agency should determine whether a borrower who has made 12 consecutive monthly payments is a good candidate
for loan rehabilitation. A borrower's previous experience in the loan rehabilitation program may be a factor considered
by the guaranty agency in making this assessment.

 Some commenters suggested the regulations should be revised to allow guaranty agencies to consider whether the borrower
is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation. The commenters noted that the Dear Colleague Letter (GEN 92&hyph;91
dated October 1992) provides that ``In determining whether a sale is practicable, a guaranty agency should determine
whether a borrower *&blank;*&blank;* is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation.'' The commenters believed that
the guaranty agency should have the discretion to deny borrowers access to its rehabilitation program if it believes
existing circumstances so warrant. The commenters suggested, for example, if there is a judgment against a borrower,
the original terms of the promissory note may have been altered, and the original note may be nonexistent. The commenters
believed that it is overly burdensome, if not illegal, to rehabilitate a loan if a judgment has been issued against
the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary interprets section 428F of the HEA to require that the rehabilitation program must be available to all
defaulted borrowers even if a guaranty agency has previously been able to secure payment from the borrower only through
involuntary means (e.g., through a court-ordered judgment, Internal Revenue Service tax offset, or wage garnishment).
The Secretary expects guaranty agencies to provide, on an unsolicited basis, information on the loan rehabilitation
program to all defaulted borrowers. However, the Secretary does not expect that payments made on the loan through
involuntary means be counted toward the borrower's required 12 consecutive payments for rehabilitation. The Secretary
believes that the defaulted borrower must initiate a voluntary series of payments for this purpose. The Secretary
understands, however, that even after the required voluntary series of monthly reasonable and affordable payments,
the rehabilitation of the loan through its purchase by a lender may not be possible in all cases. The Department expects
guaranty agencies to work diligently to identify lenders willing to purchase these loans, thereby rehabilitating
them. However, section 428F(a)(2) of the HEA states that the guaranty agency shall sell the loan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if practicable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [emphasis added]. The Secretary believes that the agency has the authority in working with its repurchasing lenders
to determine if some borrowers are not good candidates for loan rehabilitation because they continue to represent
a high risk of default once the loan is purchased. In those instances, the borrower's loan would remain with the guaranty
agency and the borrower would continue to make payments on the loan to the agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. The Secretary notes that the loan is still in default as long as it is with
the guaranty agency, even after the required series of payments are made and the borrower is not eligible for all benefits
of the program (e.g., deferment). The Secretary notes that section 428F(a) of the HEA provides that only after the
loan has been repurchased by the lender has it been effectively rehabilitated.

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that the borrower should regain full eligibility for deferments. The

eligibility.

 The Secretary believes that the borrower must make a good faith effort in making the required consecutive monthly

individuals on behalf of the borrower for purposes of rehabilitating a defaulted loan constitutes a good faith effort

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters noted that the regulations suggested that a borrower may qualify for loan rehabilitation even if
the guaranty agency has obtained a judgment against the borrower for the defaulted loan. The commenters suggested
that since the original promissory note is surrendered to the court when there is a judgment on the loan, it would become
very difficult to initiate legal proceedings against a rehabilitated borrower who again defaulted on the rehabilitated
loan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary shares the concerns raised by the commenters. However, the Secretary also believes that a borrower
should not lose the opportunity to rehabilitate a defaulted loan due solely to a judgment. Accordingly, the Secretary
has modified the regulations to require a borrower who wishes to rehabilitate a loan on which a judgment has been entered
to sign a new promissory note prior to the sale of the loan to an eligible lender. This approach is necessary to make sale
of the loan practicable.

 The Secretary did not intend to require the guaranty agency to disclose new repayment terms on the rehabilitation
loan. The Secretary agrees that it would be more appropriate for the disclosure to be done by the purchasing lender.
Rather, the Secretary merely intended the guaranty agency to provide written confirmation of the agency's determination
of the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, the number of consecutive monthly payments that must
be made to qualify for consideration for loan rehabilitation, any deadlines attached to those payments, and any factors
the agency will consider in determining whether the repurchase of the borrower's loan is practicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a guaranty agency should be required to inform a borrower when entering
into an agreement to reinstate loan eligibility of the possibility of loan rehabilitation after an additional six
monthly payment amounts and the potential consequences of loan rehabilitation. The Secretary believes that a borrower
should be provided sufficient information about the circumstances and potential consequences of loan rehabilitation
to have an understanding of what is expected before making the required 12 monthly payments. Borrowers should be aware
of, for example, that a potential increase in loan payment amounts may be necessary once the loan is repurchased by
the lender if the reasonable and affordable monthly payment amount paid to the guaranty agency will not provide for
the borrower to repay the loan within the 10-year maximum repayment period. The Secretary agrees that providing this
information will place the borrower in a position to make an informed decision of whether or not to exercise his or her
option for loan rehabilitation.

 The regulations have been revised to provide that guaranty agencies must inform borrowers of the consequences of
loan rehabilitation after 12 months. Additionally, a new paragraph has been added as &sect;682.401(b)(4)(iv) to

payments to reinstate Title IV eligibility of the possibility of loan rehabilitation.

 A few commenters recommended that the regulations be revised to reflect the 1993 Technical Amendments change that
provides that the guaranty agencies certify that diligent attempts of skip-tracing have been made by the lender under
&sect;682.411 before receiving reinsurance payments.

Some commenters suggested that the regulations should indicate that the guaranty agency assures the Secretary that
diligent attempts have been made by the lender and the guaranty agency under &sect;682.411 to locate the borrower
through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques.

 Section 428(c)(2)(G) of the HEA, as changed by the 1993 Technical Amendments, provides that the guaranty agency may
not receive reinsurance payments unless it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
certifies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that diligent attempts have been made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques.
As pointed out in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the Secretary believes that it is primarily a lender responsibility
to locate the borrower through the use of skip-tracing techniques. However, the Secretary intends that diligent
attempts must be made by either the lender or the agency to locate the borrower. The language of the regulations is intended
to insure that if the lender does not perform the required skip-tracing, the guaranty agency will be responsible for
doing so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the Secretary is authorized to require FFEL loans to be assigned to the Secretary to affect an orderly transition
from the FFEL to the Federal Direct Loan Program, one of the primary reasons for loan assignment is that the guaranty
agency has been unable to collect on a defaulted loan it holds and the Secretary believes that the Department can more
effectively collect on the loan. Loans assigned to the Department under the authority specified in section 682.409
are all defaulted FFEL loans held by guaranty agencies. These loans do not include non-defaulted FFEL loans which
a borrower has requested to be consolidated under the Federal Direct Loan Consolidation Program. Until a defaulted
FFEL borrower resolves his default status with the holder of the loan, either the guaranty agency prior to the assignment
or the Department following assignment, the borrower is not eligible for any benefits under the FFEL or Federal Direct
Loan Program. As a result, the Secretary does not believe that the mandatory assignment process benefits particular
defaulted borrowers over others.

 To the extent that the financial stability of a guaranty agency is in the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may
choose, on a case-by-case basis, not to require the assignment of loans if the assignment will jeopardize the agency's
financial stability.

 One commenter requested clarification on how mandatory assignment of FFEL loans relates to an orderly transition
from the FFEL Program to the FDSL Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted by the commenter, section 428(c)(8) of the HEA provides that the Secretary will require an agency to assign
loans if the Federal fiscal interest so requires. In addition, the statute deems the orderly transition to the FDSL
Program to be in the Federal fiscal interest. The proposed regulations did not clearly reflect the Secretary's discretion
in this area. Accordingly, the Secretary has revised the regulations to reflect the Secretary's statutory discretion.
The Secretary believes that the assignment of FFEL loans will not impede the orderly transition to the FDSL Program.
If it appears to the Secretary that the orderly transition to the FDSL Program is either impeded or facilitated by mandatory
assignment, the Secretary will exercise his authority to modify the assignment criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also the view of the Secretary that it is in the Federal fiscal interest for the Federal government to collect defaulted
student loans owed by Federal employees unless the guaranty agency has obtained a judgment against the Federal employee
to collect by wage garnishment 15 percent or more of disposable pay as defined in 34 CFR Part 31.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Designation as an Exceptional Performer means that a guaranty agency has shown a high level of compliance with the
provisions of 34 CFR 682.410. That section of the regulations focuses on the default collection process, not the results
of the process. Section 682.409 establishes standards that focus on outcomes as expressed in fiscal year loan type
recovery rates. The Secretary believes that the collection of defaulted FFEL loans is important and should be governed
by both process and outcome requirements. The Secretary does not believe that excusing guaranty agencies from complying
with outcome requirements because they have complied (even to a high degree) with process requirements would adequately
protect the Federal fiscal interest.

 The Secretary agrees that guaranty agencies need to evaluate their default prevention and default collection operations.
These regulations represent the initial attempt by the Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agencies, to
establish default collection performance standards. The Secretary believes that it is in the Department's and the
guaranty agencies' best interest to establish default prevention performance standards as soon as practicable.

 A commenter observed that guaranty agencies will be required to monitor their operations constantly, indicating
that it will be more difficult for an agency to continue producing recoveries over the 80 percent standard required
by the regulations. The commenter noted that once the Secretary imposes additional assignment requirements on agencies
that fall below the 80 percent standard, this provision will automatically increase the average recovery rate on
which the 80 percent is based.

 A commenter observed that this section does not require the Department to load and begin collection on defaulted loans
assigned to it within a specified time period. Collection activity could cease for months while an account is being

 A few commenters suggested that the Secretary amend the appeals process for failure to meet performance standards.

loans be excluded entirely from the calculation.

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the regulations should be revised to encourage compliance with the
provisions in &sect;682.401(b)(4) and &sect;682.405 requiring guaranty agencies to provide certain borrowers
with ``reasonable and affordable'' payment plans. However, the Secretary believes that excluding loans with ``reasonable
and affordable'' payment plans from the calculation would place an unnecessary reporting burden on the guaranty
agencies, as well as increase the costs that would be incurred by the Department associated with collecting and auditing
the data. The Department will provide a guaranty agency with the opportunity to demonstrate how ``reasonable and
affordable'' payment arrangements have affected its recovery rate. The Department will make a determination on
an acceptable agency recovery rate on an agency-by-agency basis. The agency will be required to identify all borrower
accounts for which required reasonable and affordable payment amounts have impacted the agency's collection recovery
rate. The Department will examine a sample of these accounts to determine how this should be assessed in determining
the agency's recovery rate.

 The Secretary considered expanding &sect;682.409(c)(1) to incorporate the manual assignment and computer tape
assignment procedures that are transmitted to the guaranty agencies each year by mail. However, the Secretary believes
that this informal notification process has worked particularly well over the last two years, in part because it has
been accomplished without the burden presented by the regulatory process. He believes that the current procedures
have provided for a flexible process that has been responsive to changing guaranty agency and Departmental needs.
Therefore, the Secretary has decided not to expand these regulations to include operational procedures associated
with mandatory assignment.

 A commenter suggested that the calculation of the guaranty agency ``Reserve fund level'' include receivables from
ED and exclude payables to ED. The commenter argued that acknowledgment of those amounts is essential for an accurate
determination of a guarantor's financial status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary is interested in determining the amount of assets in a guaranty agency's reserve fund at a point in time.
The Secretary acknowledges that the reserve fund level as defined in this paragraph does not accurately reflect the
overall financial condition of the guaranty agency. However, the Secretary also believes that including receivables
from ED and deducting payables to ED would also not result in an accurate calculation of the agency's financial condition
since agencies have receivables from and payables to parties other than ED. The Secretary agrees that if an agency's
reserve fund level, calculated in accordance with this section, is less than the minimum specified in &sect;682.410(a)(6),
the guaranty agency will be provided with the opportunity to submit information concerning its accounts payable
and accounts receivable in extenuation of its reserve level.

 A commenter recommended removing loan guarantees transferred to another agency pursuant to a plan of the Secretary

 The Secretary agrees that the reference to those loans should be removed from &sect;682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) because

 Some commenters recommended that all loans for which a claim has been paid be subtracted from the total loans guaranteed
in calculating loans outstanding in &sect;682.410(a)(8), definition of amount of loans outstanding. One commenter
recommended subtracting from the amount of loans for which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim has been paid only those loans for which claims were paid at the direction of the Secretary.

 The proposed rule would have subtracted loans for which claims are paid under &sect;682.412(e) on ineligible loans,
under &sect;682.509(a)(1) because of school closing, or at the direction of the Secretary, from total loans for which
a claim has been paid. The Secretary agrees that loans for which claims have been paid are not outstanding.

 A few commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to reflect that joint borrowers may cancel a loan even if
they do not simultaneously satisfy the same cancellation criterion but the loan would otherwise be ``cancellable''.
The commenters cited the example of a loan with joint borrowers where one borrower becomes totally, permanently disabled
and the other files for bankruptcy (with the loan subject to discharge), both conditions under which a borrower would
normally be able to cancel a loan.

 A few commenters suggested that the overaward tolerance for the FFEL program be consistent with the $200 overaward
allowed in the campus-based programs. Some commenters suggested that the statutory silence on the issue of tolerance
does not constitute a prohibition.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no statutory basis for providing a $200 tolerance in the treatment of an FFEL program overaward. Congress
has provided specific statutory tolerances in the campus-based overaward provisions and for limited purposes in
the FFEL program in section 428G(d) of the HEA. Given these precedents, if Congress had intended to provide for a general
tolerance it would have included it in the statute.

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes made to part 682 based on public comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary
has revised the regulations to include technical changes made by certain legislation, as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations
in accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely reflect statutory changes in the
regulations and do not establish substantive policy changes, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the
Secretary has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on these amendments to the regulations
is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Not be a required minimum payment amount, e.g. $50, if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable
and affordable based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. The agency must include documentation in
the borrower's file of the basis for the determination, if the monthly reasonable and affordable payment established
under this section is less than $50.00 or the monthly accrued interest on the loan, whichever is greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Be based on the documentation provided by the borrower or other sources including, but not limited to_

circumstances upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written statement of the reasonable and affordable payment
amount required for the reinstatement of the borrower's eligibility for Title IV student assistance, and provide
the borrower with an opportunity to object to those terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with written information regarding the possibility of loan rehabilitation
if the borrower makes six additional reasonable and affordable monthly payments after making payments to regain

General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) A guaranty agency that has a basic program agreement must enter into a loan rehabilitation agreement with the
Secretary. The guaranty agency must establish a loan rehabilitation program for all borrowers with an enforceable
promissory note for the purpose of rehabilitating defaulted loans so that the loan may be purchased, if practicable,
by an eligible lender and removed from default status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A loan is considered to be rehabilitated only after the borrower has made one voluntary reasonable and affordable
full payment each month and the payment is received by a guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days of the scheduled
due date for 12 consecutive months in accordance with this section, and the loan has been sold to an eligible lender.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After the loan has been rehabilitated, the borrower regains all benefits of the program, including any remaining
deferment eligibility under section 428(b)(1)(M) of the Act, from the date of the rehabilitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A borrower who wishes to rehabilitate a loan on which a judgment has been entered must sign a new promissory note
prior to the sale of the loan to an eligible lender.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A borrower may request the rehabilitation of the borrower's defaulted FFEL loan held by the guaranty agency. The
borrower must make one voluntary full payment each month for 12 consecutive months to be eligible to have the defaulted
loans rehabilitated. For purposes of this section, ``full payment'' means a reasonable and affordable payment agreed
to by the borrower and the agency. The required amount of such monthly payment may be no more than is reasonable and affordable
based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. Voluntary payments are those made directly by the borrower
regardless of whether there is a judgment against the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by income tax
off-set, garnishment, or income or asset execution. A guaranty agency must attempt to secure a lender to purchase
the loan at the end of the twelve-(12-)month payment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For purposes of this section, the determination of reasonable and affordable must_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Include a consideration of the borrower's and spouse's disposable income and reasonable and necessary expenses
including, but not limited to, housing, utilities, food, medical costs, work-related expenses, dependent care
costs and other Title IV repayment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Not be a required minimum payment amount, e.g. $50, if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable
and affordable based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. The agency must include documentation in
the borrower's file of the basis for the determination if the monthly reasonable and affordable payment established
under this section is less than $50.00 or the monthly accrued interest on the loan, whichever is greater. However,
$50.00 may not be the minimum payment for a borrower if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and
affordable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Be based on the documentation provided by the borrower or other sources including, but not be limited to_

) A statement of the unpaid balance on all FFEL loans held by other holders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The agency must include any payment made under &sect;682.401(b)(4) in determining whether the 12 consecutive
payments required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial
circumstances only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and
affordable payment amount, as determined by the agency, and explaining any other terms and conditions applicable
to the required series of payments that must be made before a borrower's account can be considered for repurchase by
an eligible lender. The statement must inform borrowers of the consequences of having their loans rehabilitated
(e.g. credit clearing, possibility of increased monthly payments). The statement must inform the borrower of the
amount of the collection costs to be added to the unpaid principal at the time of the sale. The collection costs may not
exceed 18.5 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest at the time of the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with an opportunity to object to terms of the rehabilitation of the
borrower's defaulted loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The guaranty agency must report to all national credit bureaus within 90 days of the date the loan was rehabilitated
that the loan is no longer in a default status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An eligible lender purchasing a rehabilitated loan must establish a repayment schedule that meets the same requirements
that are applicable to other FFEL Program loans made under the same loan type and provides for the borrower to make monthly
payments at least as great as the average of the 12 consecutive monthly payments received by the guaranty agency. For
the purposes of the maximum loan repayment period, the lender must treat the first payment made under the 12 consecutive
payments as the first payment under the 10-year maximum.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) (1) If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary
will direct a guaranty agency to promptly assign to the Secretary any loan held by the agency on which the agency has
received payment under &sect;682.402(d), 682.402(i), or 682.404. An orderly transition from the FFEL program to
the Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program and the collection of unpaid loans owed by Federal employees by Federal
salary offset are, among other things, deemed to be in the Federal fiscal interest. Unless the Secretary notifies
an agency, in writing, that other loans must be assigned to the Secretary, an agency must assign any loan that meets
all of the following criteria as of April 15 of each year: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The unpaid principal balance is at least $100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the loan,
and any other loans held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the agency for at least four years; for any
subsequent fiscal year such loan must have been held by the agency for at least five years.

(2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for
a loan type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal
interest, the Secretary may require the agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this
section.

Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A fiscal year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the amount collected on defaulted loans,
including collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, PLUS, SLS,
and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of that program (including payments received by the agency
on loans under &sect;682.401(b)(4) and &sect;682.409 and the amounts of any loans purchased from the guaranty agency
by an eligible lender) during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of principal and
interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts
permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal year.

 (A) If, in each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the fiscal
year loan type recovery rate for a loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery rate of all active
guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that additional
assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional

(A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section that protection of the Federal fiscal
interest requires that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an agency with a fiscal year loan
type recovery rate described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a sufficient
amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section,
to cause the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year to equal or exceed the average rate of
all agencies described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from the denominator
of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the amount of these additional loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph

Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires assignments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon petition by an agency submitted within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section,
the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of
this section only after review of the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary considers all
relevant information available to him (including any information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in
reviews of the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the Secretary
considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate above the average rate of all
active agencies to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any amounts of
loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained
by that agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a
fiscal year recovery rate 10 percent above the average rate of all active agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if the agency demonstrates
that its compliance with &sect;682.401(b)(4) and &sect;682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal year loan
type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be
assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 6, 1991, the Department published final Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (Guidelines) to provide
builders and developers with technical guidance on how to comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair
Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Fair Housing Act) that are applicable to certain multifamily dwellings designed
and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991. Since publication of the Guidelines, the Department has
received many questions regarding the applicability of the technical specifications set forth in the Guidelines
to certain types of new multifamily dwellings and certain types of units within covered multifamily dwellings. The
Department also has received several questions concerning the types of new multifamily dwellings that are subject
to the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100&hyph;430, approved September 13, 1988) (the Fair Housing Amendments
Act) amended title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act or Act) to add prohibitions against discrimination
in housing on the basis of disability and familial status. The Fair Housing Amendments Act also made it unlawful to
design and construct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, in a manner that makes them inaccessible
to persons with disabilities, and established design and construction requirements to make these dwellings readily
accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.

On March 6, 1991 (56 FR 9472), the Department published final Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (Guidelines)
to provide builders and developers with technical guidance on how to comply with the accessibility requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. (The Guidelines are codified at 24 CFR Ch.I, Subch.A., App. II. The preamble to the Guidelines
is codified at 24 CFR Ch.I, Subch.A., App.III.) The Guidelines are organized to follow the sequence of requirements
as they are presented in the Fair Housing Act and in 24 CFR 100.205. The Guidelines provide technical guidance on the
following seven requirements:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design specifications presented in the Guidelines are recommended guidelines only. Builders and developers
may choose to depart from these guidelines and seek alternate ways to demonstrate that they have met the requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act and the Department's implementing regulation provides, for example,
for use of the appropriate requirements of the ANSI A117.1 standard. However, adherence to the Guidelines does constitute
a safe harbor in the Department's administrative enforcement process for compliance with the Fair Housing Act's
design and construction requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the Guidelines, the Department has received many questions regarding applicability of the
design specifications set forth in the Guidelines to certain types of new multifamily dwellings and to certain types
of interior housing designs. The Department also has received several questions concerning the types of new multifamily
dwellings that are subject to compliance with the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Given
the wide variety in the types of multifamily dwellings and the types of dwelling units, and the continual introduction
into the housing market of new building and interior designs, it was not possible for the Department to prepare accessibility
guidelines that would address every housing type or housing design. Although the Guidelines cannot address every
housing design, it is the Department's intention to assist the public in complying with the design and construction
requirements of the Fair Housing Act through workshops and seminars, telephone assistance, written replies to written
inquiries, and through the publication of documents such as this one. The Department has contracted for the preparation
of a design manual that will further explain and illustrate the Fair Housing Act Accessibility Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questions and answers set forth in this notice address the issues most frequently raised by the public with respect
to types of multifamily dwellings subject to the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act, and
the technical specifications contained in the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question and answer format is divided into two sections. Section 1, entitled ``Dwellings Subject to the New Construction
Requirements of the Fair Housing Act'' addresses the issues raised in connection with the types of multifamily dwellings
(including portions of such dwellings) constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, that must comply with
the Act's design and construction requirements. Section 2, entitled ``Accessibility Guidelines,'' addresses
the issues raised in connection with the design and construction specifications set forth in the Guidelines.

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 6, 1991 (56 FR 9472), the Department published final Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (Guidelines).
(The Guidelines are codified at 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. II.) The Guidelines provide builders and developers with
technical guidance on how to comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988
(Fair Housing Act) that are applicable to certain multifamily dwellings designed and constructed for first occupancy
after March 13, 1991. Since publication of the Guidelines, the Department has received many questions regarding
the applicability of the technical specifications set forth in the Guidelines to certain types of new multifamily
dwellings and certain types of units within covered multifamily dwellings. The Department also has received several
questions concerning the types of new multifamily dwellings that are subject to the design and construction requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questions and answers contained in this document address some of the issues most frequently raised by the public
with respect to the types of multifamily dwellings subject to the design and construction requirements of the Fair
Housing Act, and the technical specifications contained in the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues addressed in this document are addressed only with respect to the application of the Fair Housing Act and
the Guidelines to dwellings which are ``covered multifamily dwellings'' under the Fair Housing Act. Certain of these
dwellings, as well as certain public and common use areas of such dwellings, may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be covered by various other laws, such as section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Architectural
Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157); and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101
through 12213). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 applies to programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Department's regulations
for section 504 are found at 24 CFR part 8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Architectural Barriers Act applies to certain buildings financed in whole or in part with federal funds. The Department's
regulations for the Architectural Barriers Act are found at 24 CFR parts 40 and 41. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a broad civil rights law guaranteeing equal opportunity for individuals
with disabilities in employment, public accommodations, transportation, State and local government services,
and telecommunications. The Department of Justice is the lead federal agency for implementation of the ADA and should
be contacted for copies of relevant ADA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has received a number of questions regarding applicability of the ADA to residential housing, particularly
with respect to title III of the ADA, which addresses accessibility requirements for public accommodations. The
Department has been asked, in particular, if public and common use areas of residential housing are covered by title
III of the ADA. Strictly residential facilities are not considered places of public accommodation and therefore
would not be subject to title III of the ADA, nor would amenities provided for the exclusive use of residents and their
guests. However, common areas that function as one of the ADA's twelve categories of places of public accommodation
within residential facilities are considered places of public accommodation if they are open to persons other than
residents and their guests. Rental offices and sales office for residential housing, for example, are by their nature
open to the public, and are places of public accommodation and must comply with the ADA requirements in addition to
all applicable requirements of the Fair Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the remainder of this notice addresses issues most frequently raised by the public with respect to
the types of multifamily dwellings subject to the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act, and
the technical specifications contained in the Guidelines.

Section 1: Dwellings Subject to the New Construction Requirements of the Fair Housing Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issues addressed in this section concern the types of multifamily dwellings (or portions of such dwellings) designed
and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 that must comply with the design and construction requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Townhouses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. Are townhouses in non-elevator buildings which have individual exterior entrances required to be accessible?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, if they are single-story townhouses. If they are multistory townhouses, accessibility is not required. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the discussion of townhouses in the preamble to the Guidelines under ``Section 2_Definitions [Covered Multifamily
Dwellings]'' at 56 FR 9481, March 6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. Does the Fair Housing Act cover four one-story dwelling units that share common walls and have individual entrances?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The Fair Housing Act applies to all units in buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units if such buildings
have one or more elevators; and ground floor dwelling units in other buildings consisting of four or more dwelling
units. This would include one-story homes, sometimes called ``single-story townhouses,'' ``villas,'' or ``patio
apartments,'' regardless of ownership, even though such homes may not be considered multifamily dwellings under
various building codes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Q. What if the single-story dwelling units are separated by firewalls? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The Fair Housing Act would still apply. The Guidelines define covered multifamily dwellings to include buildings
having four or more units within a single structure separated by firewalls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Commercial Space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. If a building includes three residential dwelling units and one or more commercial spaces, is the building a ``covered
multifamily dwelling'' under the Fair Housing Act? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Covered multifamily dwellings are buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units, if such buildings have
one or more elevators; and ground floor dwelling units in other buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units.
Commercial space does not meet the definition of ``dwelling unit.'' Note, however, that title III of the ADA applies
to public accommodations and commercial facilities, therefore an independent determination should be made regarding
applicability of the ADA to the commercial space in such a building. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the introduction to these questions and answers, which provides some background on the ADA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Condominiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. Are condominiums covered by the Fair Housing Act? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. Condominiums in covered multifamily dwellings are covered by the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act makes
no distinctions based on ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. If a condominium is pre-sold as a shell and the interior is designed and constructed by the buyer, are the Guidelines
applicable? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The Fair Housing Act applies to design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings, regardless of whether
the person doing the design and construction is an architect, builder, or private individual. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Additions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. If an owner adds four or more dwelling units to an existing building, are those units covered by the Fair Housing
Act? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, provided that the units constitute a new addition to the building and not substantial rehabilitation of existing
units.

(b) Q. What if new public and common use spaces are also being added? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If new public and common use areas or buildings are also added, they are required to be accessible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Q. If the only new construction is an addition consisting of four or more dwelling units, would the existing public
and common use spaces have to be made accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No, existing public and common use areas would not have to be made accessible. The Fair Housing Act applies to

new construction 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of covered multifamily dwellings. (

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section 804(f)(3)(C)(i) of the Act.) Existing public and common use facilities are not newly constructed portions
of covered multifamily dwellings. However, reasonable modifications to the existing public and common use areas
to provide access would have to be allowed, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may apply to certain public
and common use areas. An independent determination should be made regarding applicability of the ADA. (

5. Units Over Parking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. Plans for a three-story building consist of a common parking area with assigned stalls on grade as the first story,
and two stories of single-story dwelling units stacked over the parking. All of the stories above the parking level
are to be accessed by stairways. There are no elevators planned to be in the building. Would the first story of single-story
dwelling units over the parking level be required to be accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The Guidelines adopt and amplify the definition of ``ground floor'' found in HUD's regulation implementing
the Fair Housing Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24 CFR 100.201) to indicate that ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;where the first floor containing dwelling units is
above grade, all units on that floor must be served by a building entrance on an accessible route. This floor will be
considered to be a ground floor.'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
definition of ``ground floor'' in the Guidelines at 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. II, Section 2.) Where no dwelling units
in a covered multifamily dwelling are located on grade, the first floor with dwelling units will be considered to be
a ground floor, and must be served by a building entrance on an accessible route. However, the definition of ``ground
floor'' does not require that there be more than one ground floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. If a building design contains a mix of single-story flats on grade and single-story flats located above grade
over a public parking area, do the flats over the parking area have to be accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. In the example in the above question, because some single-story flats are situated on grade, these flats would
be the ground floor dwelling units and would be required to be accessible. The definition of ground floor in the Guidelines
states, in part, that ``ground floor means a floor of a building with a building entrance on an accessible route. A building
may have one or more ground floors *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Thus, the definition includes situations where the design
plan is such that more than one floor of a building may be accessed by means of an accessible route (for an example, see
Question 6, which follows). There is no requirement in the Department's regulations implementing the Fair Housing
Act that there be more than one ground floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. More Than One Ground Floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. If a two or three story building is to be constructed on a slope, such that the lowest story can be accessed on grade
on one side of the building and the second story can be accessed on grade on the other side of the building, do the dwelling
units on both the first and second stories have to be made accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. By defining ``ground floor'' to be any floor of a building with an accessible entrance on an accessible route,
the Fair Housing Act regulations recognize that certain buildings, based on the site and the design plan, have more
than one story which can be accessed at or near grade. In such cases, if more than one story can be designed to have an accessible
entrance on an accessible route, then all such stories should be so designed. Each story becomes a ground floor and
the dwelling units on that story must meet the accessibility requirements of the Act. (

7. Continuing Care Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Do the new construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act apply to continuing care facilities which incorporate
housing, health care and other types of services? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The new construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act would apply to continuing care facilities if the facility
includes at least one building with four or more dwelling units. Whether a facility is a ``dwelling'' under the Act
depends on whether the facility is to be used as a residence for more than a brief period of time. As a result, the operation
of each continuing care facility must be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it contains dwellings.
Factors that the Department will consider in making such an examination include, but are not limited to: (1) the length
of time persons stay in the project; (2) whether policies are in effect at the project that are designed and intended
to encourage or discourage occupants from forming an expectation and intent to continue to occupy space at the project;
and (3) the nature of the services provided by or at the project.

8. Evidence of First Occupancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. The Fair Housing Act applies to covered multifamily dwellings built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991. What
is acceptable evidence of ``first occupancy''? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The determination of first occupancy is made on a building by building basis. The Fair Housing Act regulations provide
that ``covered multifamily dwellings shall be deemed to be designed and constructed for first occupancy on or before
March 13, 1991 (and therefore exempt from the Act's accessibility requirements) if they are occupied by that date
or if the last building permit or renewal thereof for the covered multifamily dwellings is issued by a State, county
or local government on or before June 15, 1990.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For buildings that did not obtain the final building permit on or before June 15, 1990, proof of the date of first occupancy
consists of (1) a certificate of occupancy, and (2) a showing that at least one dwelling unit in the building actually
was occupied by March 13, 1991. For example, a tenant has signed a lease and has taken possession of a unit. The tenant
need not have moved into the unit, but the tenant must have taken possession so that, if desired, he or she could have
moved into the building by March 13, 1991. For dwelling units that were for sale, this means that the new owner had completed
settlement and taken possession of the dwelling unit by March 13, 1991. Once again, the new owner need not have moved
in, but the owner must have been in possession of the unit and able to move in, if desired, on or before March 13, 1991.
A certificate of occupancy alone would not be an acceptable means of establishing first occupancy, and units offered
for sale, but not sold, would not meet the test for first occupancy.

9. Converted Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. If a building was used previously for a nonresidential purpose, such as a warehouse, office building, or school,
and is being converted to a multifamily dwelling, must the building meet the requirements of the Fair Housing Act?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No, the Fair Housing Act applies to ``covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after'' March 13, 1991,
and the Fair Housing Act regulation defines ``first occupancy'' as ``a building that has never before been used for
any purpose.'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

10. Accessible Routes to Garages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. Is it necessary to have an accessible path of travel from a subterranean garage to single-story covered multifamily
dwellings built on top of the garage? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The Fair Housing Act requires that there be an accessible building entrance on an accessible route. To satisfy
Requirement 1 of the Guidelines, there would have to be an accessible route leading to grade level entrances serving
the single-story dwelling units from a public street or sidewalk or other pedestrian arrival point. The below grade
parking garage is a public and common use facility. Therefore, there must also be an accessible route from this parking
area to the covered dwelling units. This may be provided either by a properly sloped ramp leading from the below grade
parking to grade level, or by means of an elevator from the parking garage to the dwelling units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. Does the route leading from inside a private attached garage to the dwelling unit have to be accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Under Requirement 1 of the Guidelines, there must be an accessible entrance to the dwelling unit on an accessible
route. However, this route and entrance need not originate inside the garage. Most units with attached garages have
a separate main entry, and this would be the entrance required to be accessible. Thus, if there were one or two steps
inside the garage leading into the unit, there would be no requirement to put a ramp in place of the steps. However, the
door connecting the garage and dwelling unit would have to meet the requirements for usable doors.

11. Site Impracticality Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. Under the individual building test, how is the second step of the test performed, which involves measuring the
slope of the finished grade between the entrance and applicable arrival points? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The slope is measured at ground level from the entrance to the top of the pavement of all vehicular and pedestrian
arrival points within 50 feet of the planned entrance, or, if there are none within 50 feet, the vehicular or pedestrian
arrival point closest to the planned entrance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. Under the individual building test, at what point of the planned entrance is the measurement taken? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. On a horizontal plane, the center of each individual doorway should be the point of measurement when measuring to
an arrival point, whether the doorway is an entrance door to the building or an entrance door to a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Q. The site analysis test calls for a calculation of the percentage of the buildable areas having slopes of less
than 10 percent. What is the definition of ``buildable areas''? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The ``buildable area'' is any area of the lot or site where a building can be located in compliance with applicable
codes and zoning regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Second Ground Floors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. The Department's regulation for the Fair Housing Act provides that there can be more than one ground floor in
a covered multifamily dwelling (such as a three-story building built on a slope with three stories at and above grade
in front and two stories at grade in back). How is the individual building test performed for additional stories, to
determine if those stories must also be treated as ``ground floors''? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. For purposes of determining whether a non-elevator building has more than one ground floor, the point of measurement
for additional ground floors, after the first ground floor has been established, is at the center of the entrance (building
entrance for buildings with one or more common entrance and each dwelling unit entrance for buildings with separate
ground floor unit entrances) at floor level for that story. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. What happens if a builder deliberately manipulates the grade so that a second story, which also might have been
treated as a ground floor, requires steps? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Deliberate manipulation of the height of the finished floor level to avoid the requirements of the Fair Housing
Act would serve as a basis for the Department to determine that there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred.

13. No Covered Dwellings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Are the public and common use areas of a newly constructed development that consists entirely of buildings having
four or more multistory townhouses, with no elevators, required to be accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. The Fair Housing Act applies only to new construction of covered multifamily dwellings. Multistory townhouses,
provided that they meet the definition of ``multistory'' in the Guidelines, are not covered multifamily dwellings
if the building does not have an elevator. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 discussion of townhouses in the preamble to the Guidelines under ``Section 2_Definitions [Covered Multifamily
Dwellings]'' at 56 FR 9481, March 6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) If there are no covered multifamily dwellings
on a site, then the public and common use areas of the site are not required to be accessible. However, the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) may apply to certain public and common use areas. Again, an independent determination
should be made regarding applicability of the ADA. (

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Guidelines provide that a minimum of two percent of the parking spaces serving covered dwelling units be made
accessible and located on an accessible route to wheelchair users. Also, if a resident requests an accessible space,
additional accessible parking spaces would be necessary if the two percent are already reserved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Q. If both open and covered parking spaces are provided, how many of each type must be accessible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The Guidelines require that accessible parking be provided for residents with disabilities on the same terms and
with the full range of choices, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, surface parking or garage, that are provided for other residents of the project. Thus, if a project provides different
types of parking such as surface parking, garage, or covered spaces, some of each must be made accessible. While the
total parking spaces required to be accessible is only two percent, at least one space for each type of parking should
be made accessible even if this number exceeds two percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Q. If a project having covered multifamily dwellings provides parking garages where there are several individual
garages grouped together either in a separate area of the building (such as at one end of the building, or in a detached
building), for assignment or rental to residents, are there any requirements for the inside dimensions of these individual
parking garages? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. These garages would be public and common use space, even though the individual garages may be assigned to a particular
dwelling unit. Therefore, at least two percent of the garages should be at least 14
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; 2
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; wide and the vehicular door should be at least 10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;&hyph;0
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; wide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Q. If a covered multifamily dwelling has a below grade common use parking garage, is there a requirement for a vertical
clearance to allow vans to park? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. This issue was addressed in the preamble to the Guidelines, but continues to be a frequently asked question. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the preamble to the Guidelines under the discussion of ``Section 5_Guidelines for Requirement 2'' at 56 FR 9486, March
6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) In response to comments from the public that the Guidelines for parking
specify minimum vertical clearance for garage parking, the Department responded: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No national accessibility standards, including UFAS, require particular vertical clearances in parking garages.
The Department did not consider it appropriate to exceed commonly accepted standards by including a minimum vertical
clearance in the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, in view of the minimal accessibility requirements of the
Fair Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Guidelines refer to ANSI A117.1 1986 for the standards to follow for public and common use areas, and since
the ANSI does not include a vertical clearance for garage parking, the Guidelines likewise do not. (Note: UFAS is the
Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard.)

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14, ``Common use spaces and facilities,'' in the chart under Requirement 2 of the Guidelines. While the chart does
not address the quantity of accessible public telephones, at a minimum, at least one accessible telephone per bank

A. No, a 32-inch door would not provide a sufficient clear opening to meet the requirement for usable doors. A notation
in the Guidelines for Requirement 3 indicates that a 34-inch door, hung in the standard manner, provides an acceptable
nominal 32-inch clear opening.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Is it correct that only the exterior side of the main entry door of covered multifamily dwellings must meet the ANSI
requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The exterior side of the main entry door is part of the public and common use areas and therefore must meet ANSI
A117.1 1986 specifications for doors. These specifications include necessary maneuvering clearances and accessible
door hardware. The interior of the main entry door is part of the dwelling unit and only needs to meet the requirements
for usable doors within the dwelling intended for user passage, i.e., at least 32 inches nominal clear width, with
no requirements for maneuvering clearances and hardware. (

18. Doors to Inaccessible Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Is it necessary to provide usable doors when the door leads to an area of the dwelling that is not accessible, such
as the door leading down to an unfinished basement, or the door connecting a single-story dwelling with an attached
garage? (In the latter case, there is a separate entrance door to the unit which is accessible.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. Within the dwelling unit, doors intended for user passage through the unit must meet the requirements for usable
doors. Such doors would have to provide at least 32 inches nominal clear width when the door is open 90 degrees, measured
between the face of the door and the stop. This will ensure that, if a wheelchair user occupying the dwelling unit chooses
to modify the unit to provide accessibility to these areas, such as installing a ramp from the dwelling unit into the
garage, the door will be sufficiently wide to allow passage. It also will allow passage for people using walkers or
crutches.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. If a sliding door track has a threshold of 3/4
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;, does this trigger requirements for ramps? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. The Guidelines at Requirement 4 provide that thresholds at doors, including sliding door tracks, may be no higher
than 3/4
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; and must be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.

20. Private Attached Garages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Q. If a covered multifamily dwelling has an individual, private garage which is attached to and serves only that
dwelling, does the garage have to be accessible in terms of width and length? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Garages attached to and which serve only one covered multifamily dwelling are part of that dwelling unit, and are
not covered by Requirement 2 of the Guidelines, which addresses accessible and usable public and common use space.
Because such individual garages attached to and serving only one covered multifamily dwelling typically are not
finished living space, the garage is not required to be accessible in terms of width or length. The answer to this question
should be distinguished from the answer to Question 14(c). Question 14(c) addresses parking garages where there
are several garages or stalls located together, either in a separate, detached building, or in a central area of the
building, such as at one end. These types of garages are not attached to, and do not serve, only one unit and are therefore
considered public and common use garages.

Q. Is a dwelling unit that has a split entry foyer, with the foyer and living room on an accessible route and the remainder
of the unit down two steps, required to be accessible if it is a ground floor unit in a covered multifamily dwelling?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. Under Requirement 4, there must be an accessible route into and through the dwelling unit. This would preclude
a split level foyer, unless a properly sloped ramp can be provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Kitchen ventilation fans located on a range hood are considered to be part of the appliance. The Fair Housing
Act has no requirements for appliances in the interiors of dwelling units, or the switches that operate them. (See
``Guidelines for Requirement 5'' and ``Controls for Ranges and Cooktops'' at 56 FR 9490 and 9492, March 6, 1991, or

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. What type of reinforcement should be used to reinforce bathroom walls for the later installation of grab bars? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The Guidelines do not prescribe the type of material to use or method of providing reinforcement for bathroom walls.
The Guidelines recognize that grab bar reinforcing may be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as by providing plywood
panels in the areas illustrated in the Guidelines under Requirement 6, or by installing vertical reinforcement in
the form of double studs at the points noted on the figures in the Guidelines. The builder/owners should maintain records
that reflect the placement of the reinforcing material, for later reference by a resident who wishes to install a grab
bar.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Guidelines do not prescribe the type of product for grab bars, or the structural strength for grab bars. The Guidelines
only state that the necessary reinforcement must be placed ``so as to permit later installation of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grab bars.'' (Emphasis added.) In determining what is an appropriate grab bar, builders are encouraged to look to
the 1986 ANSI A117.1 standard, the standard cited in the Fair Housing Act. Builders also may follow State or local standards
in planning for or selecting appropriate grab bars.

Requirement 7_Usable Kitchens and Bathrooms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
25. Counters and Vanities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. It appears from Figure 2(c) of the Guidelines (under Requirement 5) that there is a 34 inch height requirement for
kitchen counters and vanities. Is this true? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Requirement 7 addresses the requirement for usable kitchens and bathrooms so that a person in a wheelchair can
maneuver about the space. The legislative history of the Fair Housing Act makes it clear that the Congress intended
that the Act affect ability to maneuver within the space of the kitchen and bathroom, but not to require fixtures, cabinetry
or plumbing of adjustable design. Figure 2(c) of the Guidelines is illustrating the maximum side reach range over
an obstruction. Because the picture was taken directly from the ANSI A117.1 1986 standard, the diagram also shows
the height of the obstruction, which, in this picture, is a countertop. This 34 inch height, however, should not be
regarded as a requirement.

26. Showers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Is a parallel approach required at the shower, as shown in Figure 7(d) of the Guidelines? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. For a 36
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; x 36
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; shower, as shown in Figure 7(d), a person in a wheelchair would typically add a wall hung seat. Thus the parallel
approach as shown in Figure 7(d) is essential in order to be able to transfer from the wheelchair to the shower seat.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Do the Guidelines set any requirements for the type or location of bathtub controls? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No, except where the specifications in Requirement 7(2)(b) are used. In that case, while the type of control is not
specified, the control must be located as shown in Figure 8 of the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
28. Paragraph (b) Bathrooms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. If an architect or builder chooses to follow the bathroom specifications in Requirement 7, Guideline 2, paragraph
(b), where at least one bathroom is designed to comply with the provisions of paragraph (b), are the other bathrooms
in the dwelling unit required to have reinforced walls for grab bars? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. Requirement 6 of the Guidelines requires reinforced walls in bathrooms for later installation of grab bars.
Even though Requirement 6 was not repeated under Requirement 7_Guideline 2, it is a separate requirement which must
be met in all bathrooms. The same would be true for other Requirements in the Guidelines, such as Requirement 5, which
applies to usable light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls; Requirement
4 for accessible route; and Requirement 3 for usable doors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

29. Bathroom Clear Floor Space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Is it acceptable to design a bathroom with an in-swinging 2
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; door which can be retrofitted to swing out in order to provide the necessary clear floor space in the bathroom?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. The requirements in the Guidelines must be included at the time of construction. Thus, for a bathroom, there
must be sufficient maneuvering space and clear floor space so that a person using a wheelchair or other mobility aid
can enter and close the door, use the fixtures and exit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
30. Lavatories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Would it be acceptable to use removable base cabinets beneath a wall-hung lavatory where a parallel approach is
not possible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes. The space under and around the cabinet should be finished prior to installation. For example, the tile or other
floor finish must extend under the removable base cabinet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
31. Wing Walls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Can a water closet (toilet) be located in an alcove with a wing wall? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, as long as the necessary clear floor space shown in Figure 7(a) is provided. This would mean that the wing wall
could not extend beyond the front edge of a lavatory located on the other side of the wall from the water closet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
32. Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. What types of penalties or monetary damages will be assessed if covered multifamily dwellings are found not to be
in compliance with the Fair Housing Act? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Under the Fair Housing Act, if an administrative law judge finds that a respondent has engaged in or is about to engage
in a discriminatory housing practice, the administrative law judge will order appropriate relief. Such relief may
include actual and compensatory damages, injunctive or other equitable relief, attorney's fees and costs, and may
also include civil penalties ranging from $10,000 for the first offense to $50,000 for repeated offenses. In addition,
in the case of buildings which have been completed, structural changes could be ordered, and an escrow fund might be
required to finance future changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, a Federal district court judge can order similar relief plus punitive damages as well as civil penalties
for up to $100,000 in an action brought by a private individual or by the U.S. Department of Justice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking amends miscellaneous hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline safety standards to provide
clarity, eliminate unnecessary or overly burdensome requirements, and foster economic growth. The changes result
from the regulatory review RSPA carried out in response to the President's directive of January 28, 1992, on reducing
the burden of government regulation. The changes reduce costs in the liquid pipeline industry without compromising
safety.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a January 28, 1992, memorandum, the President wrote to Department and agency heads about the need to reduce the burden
imposed by government regulation. The President was concerned that agencies were not doing enough to review and revise
existing regulations to eliminate unnecessary and overly burdensome requirements. The President recognized that
regulations that do not keep pace with new technologies and innovations impose needless costs and impede economic
growth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the President's memorandum, DOT published a notice requesting public comment on the Department's
regulatory programs (57 FR 4745; Feb. 7, 1992). Commenters were asked to identify regulations that substantially
impede economic growth, may no longer be necessary, are unnecessarily burdensome, impose needless costs or red tape,
or overlap or conflict with other DOT or federal regulations. The deadline for submitting comments was March 2, 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA received comments from six organizations about the pipeline safety regulations in part 195. Comments were from
three regulated pipeline companies, a pipeline trade association, a state pipeline safety agency, and a federal
agency. RSPA considered all comments in its review of the regulations, and these comments are available in the docket.
Some comments will be considered in future rulemakings. Additionally, RSPA has published a separate rulemaking
``Update of Standards Incorporated by Reference'' (58 FR 14519; March 18, 1993) which updates the editions of the
industry standards that are incorporated in part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 27, 1992, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NPRM, (57 FR 56304) proposing 18 changes to the
regulations based on the comments received from the public and asked for further comments regarding the proposed
changes. RSPA received comments from 21 organizations: 15 pipeline companies, 3 pipeline trade associations, 2
environmental organizations, and 1 county government. RSPA considered all comments in preparation of the final
rulemaking and the comments are available in the Docket.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC), consisting of 15 members, was established
by statute to consider the feasibility, reasonableness, and practicability of proposed pipeline regulations.
RSPA implemented the committee balloting process by mail. After initial balloting, the process allowed each member
to review the ballots, including comments, of all other members, and to change his or her vote or initial comment if
desired. Although some THLPSSC members did not vote on every proposed change, a tally of the second ballots showed
that a large majority of THLPSSC members found all the proposed changes technically feasible, reasonable, and practicable.
Nonetheless, in developing the final regulations, RSPA considered all final THLPSSC votes and comments, including
minority positions. The following discussion explains how RSPA treated THLPSSC positions and public comments on
the proposed amendments in developing the final rule.

Changes to Part 195 Safety Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion explains the changes to various standards in part 195: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 195.1&blank;Applicability.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Offshore production.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Part 195 does not apply to pipelines used in offshore production, whether on the Outer Continental Shelf or in state
offshore waters. However, this exception is clearly stated in part 195 only for production on the Outer Continental
Shelf (&sect;195.1(b)(5)). To clarify that all offshore pipelines used in production are outside part 195, RSPA
proposed to delete from &sect;195.1(b)(5) the phrase ``on the Outer Continental Shelf''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10 THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(5) all approved the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, RSPA received comments from three operators and two pipeline-related associations in support of the
amendment and no adverse comments. Therefore, &sect;195.1(b)(5) is amended as proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also requested comments on whether there is a gap in the regulation of production lines in state offshore waters.
Only one commenter responded. This commenter opined that existing state and federal programs adequately regulate
production lines in state waters. In Louisiana, the Departments of Natural Resources and Environmental Quality
were said to have comprehensive regulations on facility installation, operation, integrity, and removal, and sufficient
authority to address any ``gap'' that is identified. Since the other states with production lines in state waters

In-plant piping.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Part 195 does not apply to pipeline transportation through onshore production, refining, or manufacturing facilities,
or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such facilities (&sect;195.1(b)(6)). Because the physical
distinction between a regulated pipeline serving a plant and unregulated in-plant piping is unclear, RSPA proposed
to add a definition of ``in-plant piping system'' to &sect;195.2. The definition proposed was: ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In-plant piping system
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means piping that is located on the grounds of a plant and used to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between
plant facilities or between plant facilities and a pipeline, not including any device and associated piping that
are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline.'' The NPRM explained that we would consider in-plant piping to
extend to the plant boundary in the absence of a necessary pressure control device on plant grounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All ten THLPSSC members who voted on this proposal supported it. However, four members believed that because the NPRM
primarily concerned pipeline transportation rather than production, refining, or manufacturing plants, it did
not give plant owners adequate notice that the proposed definition could affect plant piping. These members wanted
RSPA to publish a separate NPRM on the subject of in-plant piping.

RSPA does not agree that another NPRM is needed. The subject of in-plant piping and the associated issues were clearly
discussed in the published NPRM. Also, all interested persons, including plant owners as well as pipeline operators,
were given an opportunity to comment on the subject of in-plant piping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA received comments on the proposed definition from seven operators, two pipeline-related associations, and
one state agency. Two operators and one association fully supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator and a pipeline-related association thought plant owners were not adequately notified of the proposed
rule, and that RSPA should treat the subject in a separate NPRM. Our position on this issue is given supra in response
to a similar criticism by four THLPSSC members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another operator was concerned that the proposed definition would cause operator-owned components, such as pipe,
meters, instruments, and manifolds, that are located on plant grounds downstream from the operator's pressure control
device to fall outside part 195. The operator was worried that other agencies would regulate these components as non-transportation
related facilities. We are not persuaded, however, that the potential for such regulation is sufficient reason to
exclude the components from the definition of in-plant piping system. The aim of the proposed definition was to distinguish
unregulated piping, not to limit the jurisdiction of other government agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, an operator of gathering and processing facilities was concerned that part 195 would apply to plant piping
that lies between any necessary pressure control device and the connection to a pipeline. This commenter apparently
did not realize that such piping is subject to part 195. RSPA has applied part 195 to such piping because it is subject
to pressure which is controlled by a device operators must have to meet &sect;195.406(b). However, this application
has had little effect on plant owners, because we hold the pipeline operator, not the plant owner, responsible for
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator commenting on the plant device exclusion in the proposed definition advised us to change ``control pressure''
to ``prevent overpressure.'' This commenter said the change would avoid making pipeline operators responsible
under part 195 for nonessential pressure control devices. We agree the suggested rewording would better convey the
intent of the proposal. But, in the final definition, we have changed ``control pressure in the pipeline'' to ``control
pressure in the pipeline under &sect;195.406(b)'' to convey the intent even more precisely.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The state agency commented that if piping on plant grounds does not include a device necessary to control pipeline
pressure, the jurisdiction of part 195 over the pipeline should not end at the plant boundary. Instead, the state agency
recommended ending jurisdiction at a component inside the plant, such as a flange, where the pipeline can be isolated
for purposes of testing. Although operators may use such components, part 195 does not require that they be on the pipeline.
Also, we believe the plant boundary is a more convenient demarcation of in-plant piping than an unspecific inside-the-plant
component. Thus, the state agency's comment is not incorporated in the final definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state agency, an operator, and a pipeline-related association were concerned that because segments of transfer
piping located off plant grounds were not included in the proposed definition, a large number of short pipelines would
come under part 195. RSPA recognizes that production, refining, or manufacturing plants often install transfer
piping off plant grounds. A plant may use this piping to transfer hazardous liquids between its different facilities
located on the same grounds; between its different facilities located on separate grounds (usually separated by
a roadway, railway, waterway, or industrial area); between its facilities and a transportation system, such as a
railroad or pipeline; or between its facilities and the facilities of another plant or industrial consumer. The three
commenters thought the off-grounds segments should qualify as in-plant piping if they connect facilities of the
same plant. The association also wanted to include under the definition off-grounds segments that connect facilities
of different plants. In addition, the operator and association argued that the off-grounds segments pose minimum
risk to public safety and the environment, because the segments generally are located in industrial areas, roadways,
or railways. The association further argued that a plant has the same operational control, including response capability,
over the off-grounds segments as it does over piping on plant grounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, we note that &sect;195.1(b)(6) echoes section 201(3) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline
Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA), (49 U.S.C. app. 2001(3)), which excludes certain ``in-plant piping systems'' from regulation
under the HLPSA. Since neither the HLPSA nor its legislative history explain ``in-plant piping,'' we adopt an ordinary,
reasonable understanding of the term. Therefore, we do not accept the interpretation that the term includes piping
that crosses the property of others outside plant grounds. However, many plants are separated by a public thoroughfare,
and plant transfer piping crosses the thoroughfare. A single public thoroughfare would include any road, from a country
lane to an interstate highway, but it does not include a railroad. Because transfer piping that crosses such thoroughfares
is comparable in most respects to other in-plant piping, RSPA considers the in-plant piping exception to include
the thoroughfare crossings. The thoroughfare exception does not apply to inter-facility lines or delivery lines,
because these lines are distinct from in-plant piping. We did not intend the proposed definition of ``in-plant piping
systems'' to expand our present interpretation of the term. So the final definition does not incorporate any of the
comments concerning piping located off plant grounds other than for thoroughfare crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the proposed definition's first use of the term ``pipeline'' is changed to ``pipeline or other mode of transportation.''
This change is needed to include, within the definition, piping on plant grounds that transfer hazardous liquid or
carbon dioxide between plant facilities and modes of transportation other than pipeline.

Terminal facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 195 does not apply to the transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide by vessel, aircraft, tank truck,
tank car, or other vehicle, or by terminal facilities used exclusively to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide
between such modes of transportation (&sect;195.1(b)(7)). RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.1(b)(7) to clarify
that terminal facilities located off terminal grounds are subject to part 195, and to distinguish unregulated terminal
facilities from a regulated pipeline entering or leaving the terminal. As with the proposed in-plant piping definition,
any device and associated piping on terminal grounds necessary to control pressure in a regulated pipeline would
not be excepted from part 195.

The THLPSSC voted to approve this proposal, but four members believed the NPRM did not give terminal owners adequate
notice that the proposed amendment could affect their piping. These members wanted RSPA to publish a separate NPRM
on the subject. For the reasons stated supra in response to a similar argument by these THLPSSC members concerning
in-plant piping, RSPA does not agree that another NPRM is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five operators and two pipeline-related associations commented on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(7).
Of these commenters, two operators and one association agreed with the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters expressed the same concerns about the proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(7) as they did about
the proposed in-plant piping definition. These concerns were that the NPRM did not adequately notify plant (terminal)
owners of the proposed rule, and that some operator-owned components located on plant (terminal) grounds would fall
outside part 195. Our response to these concerns is the same as stated supra regarding in-plant piping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to transfer lines located outside terminal grounds at ports, an operator and a pipeline-related association
pointed out that the U.S. Coast Guard regulates transfers between terminal storage and dock facilities. These commenters
suggested that RSPA and Coast Guard develop a memorandum of understanding to limit Coast Guard's regulations to dock
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that Coast Guard and RSPA jurisdictions overlap in port areas, but the two agencies have different responsibilities.
Also, the overlap does not automatically result in regulatory conflicts, and the commenters did not mention any.
Nonetheless, though we have not changed the final rule as a result of this comment, in enforcing part 195 at port areas,
RSPA will act appropriately to resolve any unnecessary regulatory burdens.

 Section 195.1(b)(8) provides that part 195 does not apply to ``[t]ransportation of carbon dioxide downstream from
a point in the vicinity of the well site at which carbon dioxide is delivered to a production facility.'' RSPA proposed
to amend this section to clarify that the exception covers pipelines used in the injection of carbon dioxide for oil
recovery operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The THLPSSC approved the proposed amendment (10 voted in favor and 5 did not vote), and we received no adverse comments

The definition of ``In-plant piping system'' is discussed above in &sect;195.1 Applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters objected to the proposed definition for petroleum products because of its use of the terms ``flammable'',
``toxic'', and ``corrosive'' which are not defined under part 195. The commenters stated that absent specific definitions
for these terms, their applicability could be unclear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA agrees with the comments about the lack of clarity in the proposed definition for petroleum products. So, the
final rule for this section includes new definitions for ``flammable'', ``toxic'', and ``corrosive'' that come
from the definitions contained in 49 CFR part 173 for Transportation and Packaging of Hazardous Materials for the
terms ``flammable liquid'', ``poisonous material'', and ``corrosive material'', respectively. RSPA has adopted
the definition of ``poisonous material'' for ``toxic'' because it considers the terms synonymous.

Section 195.3 sets out the general requirements for the incorporation in the regulations of industry standards for
the design, construction and operation of hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. Paragraph 195.3(a) states
that incorporation of a document by reference has the same force as if the document were copied in the regulations.
Some operators have misinterpreted this section to mean that they must comply with all of the terms contained in a referenced
document. Accordingly, RSPA hereby revises &sect;195.3(a) to clarify that an entire document is not incorporated
when the document is incorporated by reference; rather, only those portions specifically referenced in the regulations
are incorporated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule is being revised to conform to a recent update of references in another rulemaking (Update of Standards Incorporated

Section 195.5&blank;Conversion to service subject to this part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 195.5 regulates the conversion of steel pipelines to hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide service that is subject
to part 195. Under &sect;195.5(a)(4), a converted pipeline must be hydrostatically tested to substantiate the maximum
operating pressure (MOP) permitted by &sect;195.406.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 195.5(a)(4) actually uses the term ``maximum allowable operating pressure,'' but for consistency with
&sect;195.406, this term is changed below to MOP by removing the word ``allowable.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To substantiate the MOP of a converted pipeline, an operator must know the pipe design pressure (see current &sect;195.406(a)(1)).
Consequently, if pipe design pressure is unknown, a steel pipeline may not be converted under &sect;195.5. Although
the design pressure of components is an MOP factor under &sect;195.406(a)(2), pipeline components are normally
designed to be as strong or stronger than attached pipe. Thus, pipe design is the critical factor in substantiating
MOP under &sect;195.5(a)(4), and lack of knowledge of component design pressure is not a significant safety concern.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.5 to permit conversion using an approach found in section 845.214 and Appendix N
of ASME B31.8 for gas pipelines whose design pressure is unknown. Under this proposal, operators would pressure test
the pipeline under Appendix N until pipe yield occurs. Instead of design pressure, this yield test pressure would
be used to compute MOP by applying certain reduction factors to 80 percent of the first pressure that produces pipe
yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.5 supported it in concept. However, two members
thought the wording of Appendix N should be copied directly into part 195 to avoid referencing a gas pipeline code in
liquid pipeline regulations. We believe the principles of Appendix N apply equally to gas and liquid pipelines. And
since the B31.8 Code is widely used, operators of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipelines will not find it difficult
to obtain and apply Appendix N. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA received five comments on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.5. Two operators and a pipeline-related association
agreed with the proposed amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator suggested that if pipelines operating at less than 20 percent of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS)
are subject to &sect;195.5, RSPA should allow operators up to 10 years to meet the testing requirements. At present,
none of the standards in part 195, including &sect;195.5, applies to pipelines operating at less than 20 percent of
SMYS (see &sect;195.1(b)(3)). However, this commenter may have had in mind &sect;206 of the Pipeline Safety Act of
1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508), which provides that exceptions to regulations under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline
Safety Act of 1979 (49 U.S.C. app. 2001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), such as part 195, may not be based solely on low internal stress. Because of this statutory mandate, RSPA has proposed
to apply part 195 to certain low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines (Docket PS&hyph;117; 58 FR 12213; March 3, 1993).
Still, that proposal would not require any existing low-stress hazardous liquid pipeline to be tested under &sect;195.5,
because such pipelines would not be converted pipelines. Of course, if part 195 becomes applicable to low stress pipelines,
any pipeline converted to low stress hazardous liquid service subject to part 195 would have to be tested under &sect;195.5.
But, since testing is the backbone of the conversion process, RSPA does not believe &sect;195.5 should be amended
to extend the time for testing to 10 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A state agency was concerned that if test pressure must be measured at the high elevation point of test segments, the
test could stress the low point of the segment beyond yield. However, the Appendix N test method should not result in
overstress at the low elevation, because the method does not require increases in test pressure after the first yield
occurs in the test segment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate rulemaking proceeding (Docket No. PS&hyph;124; 57 FR 39572; August 31, 1992), RSPA proposed to allow
the use of the Appendix N method in converting pipelines to gas service under 49 CFR 192.14. This gas pipeline conversion
standard is similar to &sect;195.5. Comments to that notice argued that pressure testing to yield is unnecessary
to qualify certain pipelines that operate at low stress (generally pipelines 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside
diameter operating at pressures of 200 psig or less). RSPA believes these comments are also relevant to hazardous
liquid pipelines. All other factors being equal, hazardous liquid pipelines operating at low internal stress present
less risk of failure from time-dependent defects than higher stress hazardous liquid pipelines. Because of the lower
risk, RSPA has modified the final rule to provide that pipelines 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter to
be operated at a pressure of 200 psig or less may be converted without testing to yield. The MOP of such pipelines may
be determined under &sect;195.406 by using 200 psig as pipe design pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule has been redrafted to improve clarity, to better relate conversion to design pressure and MOP under
&sect;195.406, and to include the changes discussed supra. In the final rule, the proposed amendment to &sect;195.5(a)(1)
is revised and published as an amendment to &sect;195.406(a)(1). This latter section deals specifically with pipe
design pressure and MOP. As set forth infra, revised &sect;195.406(a)(1) provides that when pipe design pressure
is unknown for steel pipelines being converted, a reduced value of first yield hydrostatic test pressure may be used
as design pressure to compute MOP. If the pipeline to be converted is 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter
and is not yield tested, 200 psig may be used as design pressure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 195.50(f) and 195.52(a)(3) require operators to prepare reports and give telephonic notice of accidents,
respectively, when the estimated property damage due to an accident exceeds $5,000. RSPA discovered from its regulatory
review and previous enforcement cases that a significant amount of confusion exists among pipeline operators as
to which cost estimates must be included in calculating the ``estimated property damage to the property of the operator
or others *&blank;*&blank;*'' Frequently, when reporting accidents, pipeline operators fail to include as ``property
damage'' the fair market value of the product released or those costs associated with clean-up and recovery efforts.
RSPA believes these costs should be included when reporting accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the $5,000 reporting requirement requires the reporting of minor accidents, RSPA proposed amending &sect;&sect;195.50(f)
and 195.52(a)(3) to increase the reporting threshold to $50,000, the same level as required in 49 CFR part 192 and to
include as property damage the value of the product released and the costs associated with clean-up and recovery efforts.
The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the change (5 members did not vote). Two of those favoring the proposed changes recommended
that RSPA modify the final rule to limit property damage to fair market value of the lost product and initial clean-up
and product recovery costs. One member said that clean-up and recovery costs should not be included in total property
damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters disagreed with the proposed changes and recommended that the rule be withdrawn. One complaint was
that the statistical base would be discontinuous because, in the future, RSPA would not receive information on accidents
costing between $5,000 and $50,000. Another complaint was that the change could affect the development of environmental
protection requirements. RSPA understands that a change in reporting levels will cause a slight skewing due to truncation
of the data, but believes requiring operators to report accidents based solely on the $5,000 property damage criterion
is unnecessary and burdensome. Significant accidents will still be reported because the other criteria (especially
those that are environmentally related) requiring reports will be unchanged: (1) Explosion or fire, (2) loss of 50
barrels of liquid, (3) escape of five barrels a day of highly volatile liquids, (4) a death, (5) bodily harm, or (6) resulted
in the pollution of any stream. Because these requirements remain unchanged, those operators with more frequent
small releases will still be identified. As to a skewing of the data, those organizations that keep track of such statistical
data should be able to make adjustments to account for such changes. Also, as explained in the NPRM, this change will
make the liquid safety reporting requirements consistent with the gas safety reporting requirements which will
eliminate confusion. The rule change should have little, if any, effect on the environment because the same spill
volume reporting criteria remain in effect. Only the dollar level of the reporting criterion is being changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters supported the rule changes as they were written. Five others favored the changes, but proposed modification
of the rules to explain more fully the meaning of ``estimated total damage'' in order to spell out the items that must
be covered. They said that ``estimated total damage'' is ambiguous and confusing and subject to interpretation.
One commenter stated that the costs of subsurface restoration should be excluded from property damage because it
is nearly impossible to estimate the subsurface restoration costs within the time allowed to report the accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA agrees that early estimates of the costs to clean-up a liquid spill may not be exact; however, the operator should,
at a later date, submit a revised report that provides more reliable cost figures for the clean-up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA is clarifying the issue by amending &sect;195.50(f) to read: ``(f) Estimated property damage, including cost
of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding
$50,000'' and &sect;195.52(a)(3) to read: ``(3) Caused estimated property damage, including cost of clean-up and
recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000.''

Section 195.106&blank;Internal design pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 195.106(a) prescribes the formula for calculating the design pressure of steel pipe. In addition, &sect;195.106(b)
regulates the pipe yield strength used in the design pressure formula. When the specified minimum yield strength
(SMYS) of pipe is unknown, &sect;195.106(b) requires that yield strength be derived from tensile tests on random
samples of pipe. Based on a comparable gas pipeline safety standard (49 CFR 192.107(b)(2)), RSPA proposed to amend
&sect;195.106(b) to allow operators to use 24,000 psi as yield strength if pipe of unknown SMYS is not tensile tested.
Editing changes to &sect;195.106(b) were also proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10 THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment of &sect;195.106(b) supported it (5 did not vote). In addition,
RSPA received comments from four operators and one pipeline-related association. The association and three of the
operators agreed with the proposal. One of these operators suggested further editing, part of which RSPA has included
in the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator was concerned that the proposed rule could unjustifiably reduce the MOP of its pipelines. The operator
said its pipelines are made of Grade B pipe (yield strength at least 35,000 psi) or better. However, some pipelines
may contain pipe for which documentation of yield strength or tensile testing does not exist. For such pipe, without
new tensile testing, yield strength would have to be assumed to be 24,000 psi. The operator suggested that RSPA allow
operators to use appropriate evidence besides tensile tests to demonstrate the yield strength of pipe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this comment, we note, first, that the proposed amendment to &sect;195.106(b) would not affect the
design pressure of existing pipelines unless they are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed (see &sect;195.100).
Second, &sect;195.106(b) currently requires operators to use as yield strength either SMYS or a value based on tensile
testing. So the operator's apparent difficulty in verifying yield strength is a problem of compliance with the current
rule. Third, the proposed rule would relax the burden of tensile testing only when MOP does not exceed the level that
corresponds to a yield strength of 24,000 psi. When a higher MOP is desired, operators must use the tensile testing
option. Finally, RSPA is not aware of any acceptable evidence of the yield strength of pipe of unknown SMYS apart from
appropriate tensile testing. Thus, the amendments to &sect;195.106(b), as discussed above, are adopted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the comments we received on proposed amendments to nondestructive testing requirements under &sect;195.234(e)
(discussed infra) concerned the standards for acceptance of weld flaws (&sect;195.228(b)). A pipeline-related
association asked us to incorporate by reference the alternative acceptance standards for girth welds that are in
the Appendix to American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 1104 (17th edition). For weld acceptability, &sect;195.228(b)
now references the standards in Section 6 of API Standard 1104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a notice of proposed rulemaking involving our review of the gas pipeline safety standards in 49 CFR part 192 (Docket
PS&hyph;124; 57 FR 39572; August 31, 1992), RSPA proposed to allow gas operators to apply the API appendix in addition
to section 6 criteria. Although that proposal was based on a petition by API to incorporate the appendix by reference
in both parts 192 and 195, we overlooked the request to include such a proposal in the present rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the part 192 rulemaking, RSPA's gas pipeline safety advisory committee voted to support the proposed amendment.
Also, all but one of the public comments were in favor of allowing use of the Appendix of API Standard 1104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dissenting commenter was concerned that industry inspection personnel may not be qualified to apply the appendix.
However, this commenter may not have recognized that under &sect;&sect;192.243(b) and (c), operators must ensure
that nondestructive testing is performed in accordance with written procedures by persons who have been properly
trained and qualified. Sections 195.234(b) and (c) provide similar requirements for nondestructive testing of
welds on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. RSPA believes these requirements are adequate to assure
proper application of the appendix.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Appendix of API Standard 1104 applies equally to girth welds in gas and liquid pipelines. This amendment is not
mandatory, rather it provides pipeline operators an optional operating procedure. In view of the prior opportunity
for public comment on use of the appendix for gas pipelines, the favorable response by public commenters and RSPA's
advisory committee, and the fact that use of the appendix would not be mandatory, we believe that a further opportunity
for public comment is unnecessary to allow use of the appendix under &sect;195.228(b). We feel this amendment is a
logical outgrowth of the Notice and furthers our efforts to make parts 192 and 195 consistent wherever possible. This
amendment will not have a substantial impact on the regulated community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), we are amending &sect;195.228(b) to reference the appendix without
further rulemaking notice. However, should any person be adversely affected by this decision or wish to change the
final rule, that person may submit a petition for reconsideration under RSPA's rulemaking procedures in 49 CFR 106.35.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule provides that the appendix may be used only for girth welds to which the appendix applies. For example,
as section A.1 of the appendix states, neither welds in pump stations nor welds used to connect fittings and valves
are covered by the appendix. Also, the appendix applies only to girth welds between pipe of equal nominal wall thickness.

Section 195.234(e) requires that ``100 percent of each day's girth welds installed in *&blank;*&blank;* [certain]
locations must be nondestructively tested 100 percent unless impracticable, in which case at least 90 percent must
be tested.'' RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.234(e) to clarify that ``90 percent'' pertains to the number of girth
welds that must be tested over their entire circumference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;195.234(g) requires: ``At pipeline tie-ins 100 percent of the girth welds must be nondestructively
tested.'' RSPA proposed to clarify that this standard applies to tie-ins of replacement sections of pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The THLPSSC supported the proposed amendments, although one member thought part 195 should define the word ``impracticable.''
We did not adopt this recommendation because the word is used in its ordinary dictionary sense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three operators and two pipeline-related associations commented on the proposed amendments. Three commenters
agreed with the proposal, one suggested editing changes, and one made a related proposal discussed supra under the
heading, ``&sect;195.228(b) Welds; standards of acceptability.'' Although we did not adopt all the editing suggestions,
these comments helped us provide clarity to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, one commenter thought the proposed amendment of &sect;195.234(g) was unnecessary because &sect;195.200
already indicates that &sect;195.234(g) applies to replacement sections. Moreover, the commenter thought adding
the proposed phrase to &sect;195.234(g) would create confusion over whether &sect;&sect;195.234(a) through (f)
apply to replacement sections. While these observations have theoretical merit, in practice, some operators have
failed to recognize that ``pipeline tie-ins'' include tie-ins of replacement sections. The clarifying phrase adds
emphasis where it is apparently needed to assure compliance with the full extent of the rule. Section 195.234(g) is,
therefore, adopted as proposed.

Section 195.246(b) is inconsistent with &sect;195.413(b)(3) for pipe in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets (See &sect;195.2
Definitions) under water less than 15 feet deep but at least 12 feet deep, because &sect;195.246(b) permits the pipe
to be without cover or to be above the seabed if properly protected. Such pipe is a ``hazard to navigation'' under the
definition of that term in &sect;195.2, and must have the minimum cover required by &sect;195.413(b)(3). In addition,
&sect;&sect;195.248(a) and (b) are inconsistent with &sect;195.413(b)(3) for pipe in the Gulf of Mexico and its
inlets under water less than 12 feet deep. Section 195.248(a) allows pipe to be less than 12 inches below the seabed
(i.e., a hazard to navigation). In certain instances, &sect;195.248(b) allows pipe to be without cover or less than
12 inches below the seabed. Neither condition is allowed under &sect;195.413(b)(3). In light of these inconsistences,
RSPA proposed in the NPRM to amend &sect;&sect;195.246(b) and 195.248(a) and (b) to correct the problem.

Ten THLPSSC members favored the proposed changes (5 members did not vote). One of the members favoring the changes
said it would make more sense to retain the existing regulation which operators have adhered to for years. In similar
manner, two commenters and one pipeline-related organization agreed with the proposal. One commenter and two pipeline-related
organizations disagreed and suggested that references to a depth of 15 feet in the rule be eliminated. RSPA proposed
changes to &sect;&sect;195.246(b), 195.248(a) and 195.248(b) so these sections would conform with Public Law 101&hyph;599
(section 1, 104 Stat. 3038 (1990)) which requires burial of pipe where the subsurface is under 15 feet of water as measured
from mean low water. Therefore, &sect;&sect;195.246(b), 195.248(a) and 195.248(b) are adopted as proposed in the

Section 195.262(d) regulates the location of pumping equipment. The rule prohibits the installation of pumping
equipment on property not under the operator's control. It also prohibits installation less than 50 feet from the

apply conjunctively not alternatively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator suggested that instead of amending &sect;195.304(b), we should revise the definition of ``component''
to exclude pipe. We did not adopt this suggestion because the revision would affect every rule in part 195 that uses
the term ``component.'' Editing suggested by another operator was not adopted because it concerned matters not addressed

One operator felt pipe should be excluded from hydrostatic testing under &sect;195.304(b) to the same extent as other
components. The operator said that hydrostatically testing short sections of mill tested pipe is duplicative, costly,
and not needed for safety. Although the NPRM did not propose to alter the existing requirement that replacement sections
of pipe of any length must be hydrostatically tested to part 195 standards before operation, we do not agree with this
commenter's contention. Normal pipe mill tests are not duplicative of part 195 tests, and are not a proven safe alternative
to part 195 requirements. However, for short sections of replacement pipe, part 195 test requirements could be met
anywhere, including, by prior arrangement with the operator, in the pipe mill. So if an operator wishes to avoid field
testing of short replacement sections of pipe, it only needs to assure that the mill tests of those sections were done
in accordance with part 195 test requirements.

Section 195.412(a) requires an operator, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times each calendar year,
to inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way. Because some surface condition activities
that affect the safety and operation of pipelines are more visible from aerial patrols than from walking or driving
the right-of-way, RSPA proposed that the section be changed to clarify that aerial patrols are an optional method
of compliance. No comments were received regarding the change and the THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the change (5
members did not vote). Accordingly, the change to &sect;195.412(a) is adopted as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section (b) requires operators, at intervals not exceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 years, to inspect each crossing under a navigable waterway (except offshore) to determine the condition of the crossing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the inspection is to look for any damage, unanticipated loading, or loss of protection that could threaten
the safety of the pipeline. We stated in the NPRM that bored crossings are usually so deep that there is little likelihood
the pipeline could be affected by waterway-related events, such as scouring or anchor dragging. We proposed to add
an exception to &sect;195.412(b) to cover bored crossings that are too deep to be subject to waterway-related damage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the rule (5 members did not vote). However, a state pipeline agency suggested the
existing regulation be retained. The agency stated that a pipeline operator cannot be 100 percent sure a bored crossing
is so deep it cannot be affected as stated. RSPA received four additional comments, three of which expressed an opinion
that the phrase ``too deep to anticipate damage from waterway conditions or vessel traffic'' is vague and inappropriate.
The other commenter said the proposal is unduly restrictive and should be refocused from bored crossings to a more
generic performance standard potentially including all crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the comments received, RSPA agrees with those who opined that ``too deep to anticipate damage from waterway
conditions or vessel traffic'' is too vague. In the absence of a recognized standard on the subject, it is too speculative
to judge when bored crossings are buried at a sufficient depth to be safe from damage by external forces. Therefore,
it is in the interest of public safety that the current rule requiring inspection at intervals not exceeding 5 years
be retained. Accordingly, the proposed change to &sect;195.412(b) is not adopted.

Section 195.416(a) states that each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar
year, conduct tests on each underground facility that is under cathodic protection to determine whether protection
is adequate. RSPA is clarifying the rule to reduce any misunderstanding regarding what is meant by ``underground.''
The word ``underground'' in this paragraph has meant any facility that is buried or in contact with the ground. This
rule clarification will not change the burden on operators because RSPA compliance inspectors have consistently
required any facility in contact with the ground to be cathodically protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA received two comments regarding the change to &sect;195.416(a). One commenter recommended that offshore pipelines
be excluded from annual testing requirements. RSPA believes there is no acceptable substitute for regular testing
to determine if corrosion protection of all lines, both onshore and offshore, is adequate. Accordingly, ``in contact
with the ground or submerged'' is added to the rule to assure that all underwater pipelines, both onshore and offshore,
are included in the definition. The other commenter suggested requiring the testing of ``carrier pipes'' in casings.
``Carrier pipes'' are normally buried and subject to the rule. The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the proposed change
(5 members did not vote). The revision to &sect;195.416(a) is adopted as modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 195.416(f) requires that any pipe found to be generally corroded so that the remaining wall thickness is less
than the minimum thickness required by the pipe specification tolerances must either be replaced with coated pipe
that meets the requirements of part 195 or, if the area is small, must be repaired. However, the operator need not replace
generally corroded pipe if the operating pressure is reduced to be commensurate with the limits on operating pressure
specified in &sect;195.406, based on the actual remaining wall thickness.

Section 195.416(g) states that if localized corrosion pitting is found to exist to a degree where leakage might result,
the pipe must be replaced or repaired, or the operating pressure must be reduced commensurate with the strength of
the pipe based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the pits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA recognizes that paragraphs (f) and (g) do not provide guidance for an operator's use in determining the strength
of the actual remaining wall thickness of corroded steel pipe. To provide such guidance, RSPA proposed amending &sect;195.416(h)
to adopt the ASME Manual B31G procedure for determining the remaining strength of corroded steel pipe in existing
pipelines. Application of the procedure was proposed to be in accordance with the limitations set out in the B31G Manual.
The rule would provide guidance as to whether a corroded region (not penetrating the pipe wall) may be left in service;
this option might require a reduction in maximum allowable operating pressure, but may be more economical than replacement
or repair of the corroded pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten THLPSSC members voted for the proposal (5 members did not vote). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments relative to &sect;195.416(h) were received from five commenters. One commenter said the proposal to change
&sect;195.416(h) is inappropriate and should be redone to be consistent with &sect;192.485. Others stated that
the proposal was unnecessarily restrictive because it did not allow the use of other proven industry developed methods
for determining the remaining strength of corroded pipelines. The most noteworthy method mentioned was ``A Modified
Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with RSTRENG disk)'' developed by Battelle under
the Pipeline Research Committee of the American Gas Association (AGA). (Project PR 3&hyph;805, December 1989, AGA
catalog No. L51609). Project PR 3&hyph;805 was undertaken to devise a modified criterion that, while still assuring
pipeline integrity, would eliminate as much as possible the excessive specifications embodied in the ASME B31G manual.
The AGA modified criterion, using a complex analysis approach, can be carried out by means of a PC-based program called
RSTRENG. The modified criterion can also be applied via tables or curves or a long-hand equation if a simplified analysis
is preferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of the modified criterion to the rule does not compromise safety because it merely accepts an established
pipeline industry guideline, and does not impose new requirements on the operators. Accordingly, RSPA is amending
&sect;195.416(h) to include the AGA/Battelle_A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded
Pipe (with the computer disk RSTRENG).

A Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared and is available in the docket. RSPA estimates the proposed changes to existing
rules would result in an estimated savings of $1,534,000 per year for the hazardous liquid pipeline industry at no
cost to the industry, and with no adverse effect on safety. As discussed above, these savings would come largely from
the use of new technology, greater flexibility in constructing and operating pipelines, and the elimination of unnecessary

RSPA criteria for small companies or entities are those with less than $1,000,000 in revenues and are independently
owned and operated. Few of the companies subject to this rulemaking meet these criteria. Accordingly, based on the
facts available concerning the impact of this proposal, I certify under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule applies to intrastate and interstate pipeline facilities used in the transportation of hazardous liquids or
carbon dioxide.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to revise completely subpart A of part 82 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, concerning exotic
Newcastle disease in birds and poultry, and psittacosis or ornithosis in poultry. We have reviewed part 82 as part
of our ongoing review of existing regulations, and believe that a complete revision of subpart A is necessary. Revising
the regulations would make them easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance with the regulations, and would
make them more effective in preventing the interstate spread of these diseases. We are also proposing to amend parts
53, 71, 92, 94, and 161 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, to reflect the amendments to part 82 we are proposing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 82, subpart A, restrict the interstate movement of certain poultry, birds, and other
items from premises and areas quarantined because of exotic Newcastle disease, and psittacosis or ornithosis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Psittacosis and ornithosis are two different names for the same disease. However, ``psittacosis'' commonly refers
to the disease in humans and birds and ``ornithosis'' refers to the disease in poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have reviewed the exotic Newcastle disease and psittacosis/ornithosis regulations in accordance with our regulatory
review plan, which provides for ongoing review of existing regulations. Based on this review, we believe a complete
revision of these regulations is necessary.

We have also reviewed the regulations in 9 CFR part 82, subpart B, which provide for certain testing, restrictions
on movement, and other restrictions on certain chickens, eggs, and other articles due to the presence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella enteritidis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These regulations were established in February 1990 [Docket No. 88&hyph;161, 55 FR 5576&hyph;5584] and were most
recently amended in January 1992 [Docket No. 91&hyph;193, 57 FR 776&hyph;779]. These regulations are not being revised
as part of this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to revise the regulations in subpart A (referred to below as the regulations) to accomplish two goals.
One goal is to make the regulations easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance with them. The other goal
is to make the regulations more effective in preventing the interstate spread of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and psittacosis/ornithosis.

Psittacosis or Ornithosis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing to change the name of the disease ``psittacosis or ornithosis'' to ``chlamydiosis.'' Since the time
the regulations were last amended, accepted veterinary medical terminology has changed. The disease ``psittacosis
or ornithosis'' is now generally referred to as ``chlamydiosis.'' In this proposed rule, we will use the term ``chlamydiosis''
when referring to the disease referred to in the current regulations as ``psittacosis or ornithosis.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In current &sect;82.1, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is defined as the exotic viscerotropic type of Newcastle disease, a contagious, infectious, and communicable disease
of poultry. We are proposing to revise the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include any velogenic Newcastle disease. (``Velogenic'' refers to the severity of the strain of the virus in question.)
Velogenic Newcastle disease is an acute, rapidly spreading, and usually fatal exotic viral disease of birds and poultry.
If there were an outbreak of any velogenic Newcastle disease in this country, it would be treated in the same way as velogenic
viscerotropic Newcastle disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we are proposing in part 82, we are proposing to amend 9 CFR parts 92, 94, and 161 to use the term ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' instead of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND), and are proposing to revise the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 9 CFR part 94 to make it consistent with the proposed definition in part 82.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to make the regulations easier to understand, we are proposing to reorganize them. Under our proposal, part
82 would be divided into three portions, instead of the current two. The first portion (proposed subpart A) would concern
quarantines and other restrictions imposed only because of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (END). The second portion (proposed subpart B) would concern restrictions imposed only because of chlamydiosis.
Subpart C would contain the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella enteritidis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 serotype 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
enteritidis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in proposed subpart A would: (1) Set forth criteria for determining birds or poultry to be infected
with, exposed to, or free from END; (2) explain how and when we would impose a quarantine; (3) list specific requirements
for moving quarantined birds, poultry, and other items interstate; (4) explain how and when we would remove a quarantine;
and (5) Set forth provisions regarding replacement birds and poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in proposed subpart B would: (1) set forth general restrictions on the interstate movement of poultry
infected with chlamydiosis and on the interstate movement of other items related to infected poultry; and (2) list
requirements for cleaning and disinfecting premises, vehicles, and other equipment that are or that have been used
in holding or moving poultry infected with chlamydiosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing many other nonsubstantive and substantive changes to the regulations. These proposed changes,
which are all intended to make the regulations more effective in preventing the interstate spread of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exotic Newcastle disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and chlamydiosis, are discussed individually below. Some of these provisions are similar or identical with regard
to both the END and the chlamydiosis regulations (proposed subparts A and B). Other changes are particular to the END
regulations (proposed subpart A). In this preamble, we discuss first those provisions that are particular to proposed
subpart A. We then discuss those provisions that are similar or identical in proposed subparts A and B.

Provisions Particular to the END Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing to delete current &sect;82.2(a). This section states that ``poultry, psittacine and mynah birds,
and birds of all other species'' are susceptible to END and, therefore, that ``the provisions of [the regulations]
shall be applicable in relation to such birds in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions are applicable
in relation to poultry.'' This language is not needed in our proposal, because we clearly specify which requirements
apply to birds, to poultry, or to both birds and poultry.

Task Force
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing to remove or replace all references to ``task force'' and ``Director of the Task Force'' in the regulations.
In order to eradicate specific outbreaks of END, we have sometimes established task forces. However, because we do
not always do so, the current regulations can be confusing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infected group
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Footnotes to that definition describe these methods of determination in greater detail. In

this document, we are proposing to delete the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infected group
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to include the basis for determining whether birds or poultry are infected with END in proposed &sect;82.2, and to
describe more specifically the factors that will be considered in making that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing that the determination whether birds or poultry are infected with END would be based on one or more
of the following factors: clinical evidence (signs, post-mortem lesions, and history of the occurrence of END);
diagnostic tests; or epidemiological evidence (evaluation of clinical evidence and the degree of risk posed by the
potential spread of END based on population and exposure factors, including evaluation of whether the birds and poultry
have had the opportunity to be in contact with birds or poultry infected with END or with excrement from birds or poultry
infected with END, or if they have shared feed or water with birds or poultry infected with END). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Basis for Determining Exposure to END 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current and the proposed regulations, birds and poultry determined to be exposed to END, and certain articles
related to those birds and poultry, are subject to certain prohibitions and restrictions regarding their interstate
movement. We are proposing to set forth in proposed &sect;82.2 more specific factors for determining exposure to
END than those set forth in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed group
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;82.1 of the current regulations. The determination of whether birds and poultry are exposed to END would
be made by either a Federal or a State veterinarian and would be based on an evaluation of all related circumstances,
including: the proximity of the birds or poultry to birds or poultry infected with END, to excrement from birds or poultry
infected with END, and to other material touched by birds or poultry infected with END; the number of birds or poultry
infected with END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; the species involved; the virulence of the END to which
the birds and poultry were exposed; and the length of time the birds or poultry were in contact with birds or poultry
infected with END, and to material touched by birds and poultry infected with END. Birds or poultry determined to be
exposed to END would continue to be treated as exposed unless they are subsequently determined to be infected with
END or until either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian finds them to be free of END, based on the factors
used to determine that birds or poultry are infected with END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to include in &sect;82.1 a definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that would read as follows:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
At risk of developing END because of association with birds or poultry infected with END, excrement from birds or poultry
infected with END, or other material touched by birds or poultry infected with END, or because there is reason to believe
that association has occurred with END or with vectors of END, as determined by either a Federal veterinarian or a State
veterinarian.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Quarantines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In current &sect;82.3, we refer to the quarantining of ``premises'' containing birds and poultry that are infected
with or have been exposed to END. However, elsewhere in the regulations, we refer to quarantined ``areas'' rather
than premises. We believe this discrepancy in terms is confusing. The intent of the quarantine provisions in the current
regulations is that areas to be quarantined may include premises, but are not limited to specific premises. In this
proposed rule, we would clarify our intent by referring to quarantined areas, rather than quarantined premises.
Also, rather than providing that premises where either infected or exposed birds or poultry exist will be quarantined,
as in the current regulations, we are proposing to provide that any area where birds or poultry infected with END are
located will be quarantined. We would delineate these areas in such a way that they would be sufficient, as determined
by epidemiological evaluation, to include all known infected and exposed birds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;82.3 (a)(2) and (b)(3) of the current regulations, there are certain requirements that must be met before
we will remove a quarantine. If we have quarantined premises because of infected birds and poultry, one of the requirements
for removal of the quarantine is the destruction of all the birds and poultry on the premises where the infected birds
or poultry are located. However, if we have quarantined premises because of the presence of exposed birds and poultry,
the exposed birds and poultry do not have to be destroyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;82.14 of the proposed regulations, all birds and poultry in an area quarantined because of the presence
of birds or poultry infected with END would not have to be destroyed_rather, only those birds and poultry determined
to be infected with END. Improved testing technology now makes it easier to determine which birds or poultry in a quarantined
area are actually infected with END. Therefore, the total number of birds and poultry that would have to be destroyed
could be lower than under the current regulations.

Interstate Movement of Various Articles

Both the current regulations (&sect;82.4) and the proposed regulations

that could carry and spread the END virus. We are proposing not only to reorganize and rewrite this material to make
it clearer and easier to follow, but we are also proposing to make substantive changes in the restrictions.

Current &sect;82.4 prohibits the interstate movement from any quarantined area of poultry and birds that are not
being moved to a Federally inspected slaughtering establishment, and also prohibits the interstate movement from
any quarantined area of hatching eggs, carcasses, parts of carcasses, and litter. We propose to replace this general
prohibition with a list of specific articles prohibited from being moved interstate from a quarantined area (see
proposed &sect;82.4(a)). We propose to prohibit: (1) live birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END; (2) dead
birds and dead poultry, including any parts of the birds and poultry, that are infected with END; (3) any eggs from birds
or poultry infected with END; (4) hatching eggs from birds or poultry exposed to END; and (5) litter and manure from
birds and poultry infected with END. This list does not include some articles that are prohibited under the current
regulations_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
viz
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, carcasses and parts of carcasses of birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be infected with END,
and hatching eggs from birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be either infected with or exposed
to END. We believe that the restrictions we are proposing to place on the interstate movement of these articles from
a quarantined area (discussed below) would allow them to be moved interstate without significant risk of spreading
END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, we are proposing to specify in &sect;82.4(c) that the regulations would not apply to the interstate
movement of birds, poultry, and other articles from a quarantined area if the interstate movement is made by the United
States Department of Agriculture for purposes of research or diagnosis. We believe this provision is necessary to
allow the Department to efficiently diagnose an outbreak of END and to conduct research relating to END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Interstate Movement of Live Birds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations in &sect;82.4(c) allow the interstate movement from quarantined areas of birds that are
``personal pets'' and that are not known to be infected with or exposed to any communicable disease of poultry. We are
proposing to set forth these provisions in proposed &sect;82.5(a), with several changes. The current regulations
require in several places that the birds be in the owner's ``possession'' or ``personal possession.'' We believe
this wording does not clearly convey our intent. We do not consider it necessary for the birds to be in physical proximity
to the owner at all times. Rather, we consider it necessary for the owner to be responsible for the location and disposition
of the birds. Therefore, we are proposing to replace the terms ``possession'' and ``personal possession'' with the
requirement that the birds be under the owner's ``ownership and control.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulations require ``immediate'' notification of Federal or State officials if any pet birds that have
been moved interstate from a quarantined area show signs of disease or die. We believe the term ``immediate'' might
be confusing, and, therefore, are proposing that the notification be made within 24 hours of the bird's dying or showing
clinical signs of sickness. We believe that 24 hours allows a reasonable period of time for notification, without
creating a significant risk that the disease will spread during that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interstate Movement of Live Poultry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations restrict the interstate movement of live poultry from a quarantined area (see current &sect;82.4(a)),
and require that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be moved to a Federally inspected slaughtering establishment for ``immediate'' slaughter. We are proposing to amend
these requirements (see proposed &sect;82.5) to extend this provision to birds as well as poultry. While in most cases
birds other than poultry would not be moved to slaughter, such movement could occur in the case of ratites (e.g., ostriches),
which can be used commercially after slaughter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to require that the birds or poultry be accompanied by a permit and be slaughtered within 24 hours
of arrival at the recognized slaughtering establishment. Shipments of poultry normally arrive at slaughtering
facilities at night or early in the morning. (Currently, birds other than poultry are not being shipped to slaughter.)
They are kept under cover until the facility can handle them in turn. We believe that 24 hours provides the facility
with a reasonable amount of time to slaughter birds or poultry moved there, without posing a significant risk of disease
spread. Allowing a lengthier period of time before slaughter would unnecessarily increase the risk of END contamination
of personnel and equipment at the slaughtering establishment, and thus increase the risk that END would be carried
outside the establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to require that the shipment of birds or poultry be covered in such a way so as to prevent feathers
and other debris from blowing or falling off the means of conveyance. Additionally, we are proposing to require that,
except for emergencies, the birds and poultry not be unloaded until arrival at the destination listed on the permit.
We would consider events such as accidents, vehicular failure, or natural disasters to be emergencies. We believe
that each of these provisions is necessary to guard against the possibility of disease spread while the birds or poultry
are being transported.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations in &sect;82.4 prohibit the interstate movement from a quarantined area of carcasses and
parts of carcasses of birds and poultry, including birds and poultry that are not known to be infected with END. We believe
that this provision is unnecessarily restrictive, and that carcasses and parts of carcasses of birds and poultry
not known to be infected with END can be moved interstate under certain conditions without an undue risk of disease
spread. We are therefore proposing to allow such movement, as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the preceding paragraph, the current regulations refer to ``carcasses and parts of carcasses.'' We believe
that the term ``carcasses'' might give the impression that only dressed carcasses are being referred to, such as those
handled at slaughtering establishments. In some cases in this proposed rule, that is what we are referring to. In other
cases, however, we are referring to any dead birds or poultry, whether they have been dressed or not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid confusion as to what we are referring to, in this proposed rule we use the wording ``dead birds and dead poultry,
including any parts of the dead birds and dead poultry,'' when all dead birds and dead poultry, including dressed carcasses,
are being referred to. We use the term ``dressed carcasses'' when the intent is to limit the provisions to birds and
poultry that have been eviscerated, with heads and feet removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be moved interstate, dead birds and dead poultry that are not known to be infected with END and that are intended for
disposal, including any parts of the dead birds and dead poultry, would have to be accompanied by a permit, the dead
birds and dead poultry would have to be covered in such a way as to prevent feathers and other debris from blowing or falling
off the means of conveyance, and the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be either moved under official seal or
accompanied by a Federal representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Official seal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be defined in &sect;82.1 as a serially numbered metal or plastic strip, consisting of a self-locking device
on one end and a slot on the other end, that forms a loop when the ends are engaged and that cannot be reused if opened, or
a serially numbered, self-locking button that can be used for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would not allow the unloading of the dead birds and dead poultry until their arrival at the
destination listed on the permit, and the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be moved to the destination listed
on the permit without any stops, except for normal traffic conditions. The dead birds and dead poultry would have to
be disposed of by rendering, incineration, composting, burial, or other methods approved by the Administrator as
being adequate to prevent the dissemination of END, within 24 hours of the loading for shipment of the birds and poultry.
A copy of the permit that accompanied the dead birds and dead poultry interstate would have to be submitted so that it
is received by both the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in Charge in the State of destination within
72 hours of the arrival of the dead birds and dead poultry at the destination listed on the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for the interstate movement of dressed carcasses would be largely the same as those for the interstate
movement of other dead birds and dead poultry, with the following differences: (1) The dressed carcasses would have
to be from birds and poultry slaughtered in a recognized slaughtering establishment; (2) the requirement that the
means of conveyance be covered so as to prevent feathers and other debris from blowing or falling off would not apply
to dressed carcasses; and (3) the disposal requirements described above for other dead birds and dead poultry would
not apply to dressed carcasses, which are intended for consumption.

Interstate Movement of Manure and Litter

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;82.4(e) provides for the interstate movement from a quarantined area of manure from poultry or birds
that are not known to be infected with END. These provisions include requirements for heating the manure and sealing
it in an airtight container. Current &sect;82.4(e) also requires the submission to a Federal inspector of a declaration
that provides information regarding the shipment of manure. We are proposing to retain the requirements of current
&sect;82.4(e), and to set them forth in proposed &sect;82.7, with several changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we would extend the provisions that currently apply to shipments of manure to include litter as well. In proposed
&sect;82.1, we would define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
litter
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as ``material that is used to collect and absorb bodily wastes from birds or poultry.'' This material, which commonly
consists of wood shavings or a similar material, cannot be easily separated from the bodily wastes. Second, we would
require that shipments of manure and litter be accompanied by a permit.

Interstate Movement of Hatching Eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations in &sect;82.4 prohibit the interstate movement of hatching eggs from quarantined areas,
except for specific movements allowed by APHIS upon request and under special conditions. We believe, however, that
it is possible to establish general conditions under which hatching eggs from birds and poultry not known to be infected
with or exposed to END can be moved interstate from a quarantined area without a significant risk of spreading END.
Under these conditions, set forth in proposed &sect;82.9, the hatching eggs would have to be accompanied interstate
by a permit. The proposed regulations would require that a copy of the permit be submitted so that it is received by both
the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the
arrival of the hatching eggs at premises designated jointly by the Veterinarian in charge and the State animal health
official. The hatching eggs would have to be held at this designated premises from the time of arrival until hatched,
and the birds and poultry from the hatching eggs would have to remain at the designated premises for not less than 30
days following hatching. During this holding period, the eggs and any birds or poultry hatched from the eggs would
be subject to any inspections, disinfections, and tests as may be required by the Administrator to determine their
freedom from END.

Interstate Movement of Eggs Other Than Hatching Eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations currently require table eggs to be washed and sanitized for processing before they are moved interstate
from an area quarantined because of END. (See current &sect;82.4(b).) We propose to clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement in several ways. First, we propose in proposed &sect;82.8 to amend the requirement so that it refers
to eggs, other than hatching eggs, from birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be infected with
END. Second, we propose to require that the eggs be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with regulations issued by
the Agricultural Marketing Service, as set forth in 7 CFR part 59. These provisions are clearer and more specific than
our current requirement that the eggs be ``washed and sanitized.'' They are the industry standard for cleaning eggs,
and are suitable for eggs from quarantined areas. Also, the provisions in 7 CFR part 59 include a requirement that the
eggs be sanitized using a solution containing available chlorine of between 100 and 200 ppm. This solution would kill
any END virus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would also require that the eggs that are being moved be packed either in flats or cases that have not been used before,
or used plastic flats or cases that were cleaned and disinfected, since last being used, in accordance with the cleaning
and disinfection provisions set forth in 9 CFR part 71. Additionally, we are proposing to require that any containers
intended for reuse after arriving at a facility be cleaned and sanitized before being returned to premises where birds
or poultry are kept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Interstate Movement of Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;82.4(d) allows the movement of metal and hard plastic coops interstate from a quarantined area if those
items are first cleaned and disinfected under the supervision of a Federal or State inspector. Based on our experience
enforcing the regulations, we believe it is necessary to enhance our monitoring and tracking capabilities by expanding
the criteria that would have to be met before metal and hard plastic coops may be moved interstate from a quarantined
area. We would set forth these criteria in proposed &sect;82.10. Additionally, in proposed &sect;82.10 we would
extend these requirements to cages, containers, troughs, vehicles, and other equipment used for birds, poultry,
eggs, manure, and litter from a quarantined area. These items can be cleaned and disinfected to destroy the END virus
as effectively as can metal and hard plastic coops, using the same cleaning and disinfecting methods. For such items
to be moved interstate, they would have to be accompanied by a permit; they would have to be cleaned and disinfected
in accordance with 9 CFR part 71; the equipment would have to be inspected by a Federal or State representative after
it was cleaned but before it was disinfected; and it would have to be disinfected in the presence of a Federal or State
representative with a disinfectant listed in 9 CFR part 71. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to add like requirements for cleaning and disinfecting these items after they have been used to move
birds, poultry, eggs, manure, or litter interstate from a quarantined area. Proposed &sect;82.10(b)(1) would require
that the equipment be cleaned and disinfected at the place where it is unloaded or otherwise used, within 2 hours after
unloading or use. This 2 hour time limit is proposed to provide a person with a reasonable time in which to complete the
cleaning and disinfection. We recognize that in some cases such locations may not have the facilities necessary to
readily carry out the required cleaning and disinfection. Therefore, we would provide in proposed &sect;82.10(d),
that if the place where cleaning and disinfection would otherwise be required has no facilities for cleaning and disinfecting,
the items may be moved to a place where facilities are available for cleaning and disinfection, provided a Federal
representative or State representative has determined that such movement would not cause a risk of the spread of END.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under our proposal, the requirements described in the preceding paragraph would not apply to equipment used by or
to move pet birds moved interstate. We believe that the proposed conditions governing the movement of pet birds interstate
would be adequate to ensure that the pet birds so moved pose an insignificant risk of being infected with END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Interstate Movements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations provide, at &sect;82.4(f), that the Deputy Administrator may allow, under special conditions,
the interstate movement of any poultry not known to be infected with END, even if they could not otherwise be moved under
the regulations. However, the current regulations do not allow for similar movement of articles other than poultry.
We believe that the regulations should allow for the movement of articles other than poultry that could be moved without
risk of spreading END, but that would otherwise be prohibited movement under the regulations. Therefore, we are proposing
to expand this provision to provide for the interstate movement of any restricted articles, if the Administrator
determines that the articles can be moved without spreading END. (See proposed &sect;82.12. See also discussion
in this document under ``Internal Agency Policy.'') For these articles to be moved interstate, they would have to
be accompanied by a special permit, as we explain below under the heading ``Permits and Special Permits.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;82.4(f) also contains material pertaining to agency management that the Administrative Procedure
Act does not require us to publish in our regulations. We are therefore proposing to delete the statement that the Deputy
Administrator will notify State officials when a permit is granted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of Quarantines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations (current &sect;82.3(a)(2)(i)) require the disposal of all birds and poultry in the quarantined
area that are infected with END, before we will remove the quarantine. In proposed &sect;82.14, we are proposing that
all infected birds in the quarantined area that have been euthanized, and any other birds and poultry that died of any
other cause other than slaughter, must be disposed of by specified means. This would help ensure that the carcasses
of all birds and poultry infected with END, whether the birds and poultry were euthanized or died of the disease itself,
are disposed of in such a way as to prevent the dissemination of END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;82.3 requires that the carcasses of the birds and poultry be destroyed, buried, incinerated, or otherwise
properly disposed of as the Deputy Administrator may direct. We are proposing to make several changes in this requirement.
First, we are proposing to allow rendering or composting of the dead birds and poultry. Both rendering and composting
destroy the END virus. Second, we are proposing to delete the words ``otherwise properly disposed of as the Deputy
Administrator may direct.'' The exact meaning of this phrase is not clear. Under the proposed regulations, if a person
wants to dispose of dead birds or poultry, manure, or eggs from infected birds or poultry by using a method the regulations
do not allow, the person may be able to obtain a special permit to do so. (See ``Permits and Special Permits'' below,
regarding proposed &sect;82.12.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulations do not include any requirements for disposing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eggs, manure, and litter from infected and exposed birds and poultry before we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove a quarantine. However, each of these items can potentially spread END. Therefore, we are proposing to amend
the regulations to ensure that these possible sources of END infection are eliminated before we remove a quarantine.
In proposed &sect;82.14(d), we would require either the burial, reduction to ashes by incineration, or rendering
of all eggs from birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END. In proposed &sect;82.14(e), we would require that
all manure and litter from birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END be buried, reduced to ashes by incineration,
composted, or spread on a field and turned under. All of these methods of disposing of eggs, manure, and litter would
destroy the END virus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to add specific requirements to the regulations for the disposal of articles by burial, composting,
or spreading and turning under. As noted above, burial would be an option for the disposal of birds, poultry, eggs,
manure, and litter. If burial is used for disposal, it would have to be done in the quarantined area in a location that
meets all United States Environmental Protection Agency, State, and local requirements for landfills. The articles
would have to be buried at least 6 feet deep and covered at the time of burial with soil. Requiring burial at least 6 feet
deep would prevent most burrowing animals from coming in contact with the buried material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Composting would be an option for the disposal of birds and poultry infected with END, and for the disposal of manure
produced by and litter used by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END. Because of the difference in the nature
of the material being composted, the procedures for composting birds and poultry would differ from those for composting
manure and litter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To compost dead birds and poultry infected with END, the procedures set forth in &sect;82.14(c)(2) of this proposed
rule would have to be followed. These procedures would require the creation of a layered mixture consisting of manure
cake (litter and manure); a carbon source such as straw, peanut hulls, or wood chips; and the birds or poultry. The mixture
would need to sit for two 30-day heating cycles, during which its internal temperature would need to reach at least
140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (to kill fly larvae and disease organisms). After the first 30-day heating cycle, the compost pile would have
to be turned over and aerated, to provide the oxygen necessary for the composting bacteria. Following the second 30-day
heating cycle, the mixture would need to be covered with a material that will prevent penetration of air and moisture
for an additional 30-day period. The compost pile would have to be at least 50 yards from any building or pen where poultry
or birds are housed, to guard against wind-borne transmission of material that might be contaminated with END, and
would have to be inaccessible to any poultry and birds. This requirement would also be applied to disposal of manure
and litter by spreading and turning under. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To compost manure and litter, the procedures set forth in &sect;82.14(e)(2) would have to be followed. The manure
and litter would have to be placed in rows 3 to 5 feet high and 5 to 10 feet at the base, be kept moist, and be kept covered.
The internal temperature of the compost pile would need to rise to at least 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, and the manure or litter would have to be mixed every 10 to 15 days, in order to provide sufficient oxygen to the
composting bacteria. The composted manure or litter could not be utilized for at least 30 days from the time the 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F temperature is reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spreading and turning under would be an option only for the disposal of manure and litter. If the manure and litter is
spread on a field and turned under, the field would have to be in the quarantined area. The manure and litter would have
to be turned over within 24 hours of being spread on the field, and be left undisturbed for at least 30 days after being
turned under, to ensure that the END virus has become inactive. We believe a 24-hour time period for turning the manure
and litter over would be short enough to guard against transmission of the END virus, while providing a practicable
amount of time for completing the process of turning under.

The current regulations do not require cleaning and disinfection of cages, equipment, or similar articles that have
been used for END-infected birds and poultry. Since cages and other equipment that have been used to handle infected
birds and poultry could spread END, we are proposing in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;82.14(g) that, as a condition of removal of a quarantine, all cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other
equipment used for birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END, or their excrement or litter, must either be reduced
to ashes by incineration, or be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9 CFR part 71. If cleaning and disinfection is chosen, it would be required that the articles be inspected after cleaning,
and before disinfection, by a Federal or State representative, and then be disinfected in the presence of a Federal
or State representative. It would be required that a disinfectant listed in 9 CFR part 71 be used. The same cleaning
and disinfecting procedures would be required for premises where birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END
were located, to prevent the transmission of END from the premises to birds or poultry.

Footnote 6 to current &sect;82.4 states that we will give pet bird owners a copy of the agreement they sign and that it
will contain the names and addresses of Federal and State officials in the State where they are taking their pet birds.
This footnote also states that we will notify State officials in that State that the pet birds are being brought into
that State. None of this material is necessary as part of the regulations. Addresses of Federal and State officials
are available in local telephone directories. Because the statement that we will notify State officials relates
to agency management, the Administrative Procedure Act does not require us to publish it in our regulations. We are
therefore proposing to delete this material.

We are proposing to delete current &sect;82.6, which, among other things, requires the banding of certain psittacine
birds moved interstate from

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 11243&hyph;11246, Docket No. 82&hyph;019), amending the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to add &sect;82.6. Then, on April 20, 1982, we published another interim rule in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 16772&hyph;16773, Docket No. 82&hyph;037) suspending the section until further notice. The reason for suspending
the section was that we could not provide necessary inspection services. Although this section has been inactive
since April 20, 1982, it has continued to appear in the Code of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Regulations. We believe this is confusing. In addition, we are still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not able to provide the inspection services required by &sect;82.6. Therefore, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are proposing to delete this section.

Changes Affecting Both the END and the Chlamydiosis Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain of the substantive changes we are proposing to current part 82, subpart A, apply to both the END and the chlamydiosis
regulations. We discuss these proposed changes in the following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Permits and Special Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations in part 82, subpart A, regarding both END and psittacosis/ornithosis (chlamydiosis), do
not require a permit for the interstate movement of restricted items, if the items are moved in accordance with the
regulations. We are proposing to require that a permit accompany such movements (provisions regarding the issuance
of permits are set forth in proposed &sect;&sect;82.11 and 82.23), and that a copy of the permit be received by the State
animal health official and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of
the shipment at the destination listed on the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An application for a permit would have to include: (1) The applicant's name and mailing address; (2) the name and mailing
address of the person who would receive the birds, poultry, or other items; (3) the addresses of both the origin and
destination of the shipment; (4) the number and types of birds, poultry, and other items intended for interstate movement;
and (5) the reason for interstate movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of interstate movement under the END regulations, the applicant for a permit would also be required to submit
a declaration or affidavit listing the requirements in the regulations for interstate movement of the items in question,
and stating that the applicant will move the items interstate only if all of the listed requirements are met (&sect;82.11(b)).
This declaration or affidavit would help us determine whether to issue a permit, by demonstrating whether the applicant
has the knowledge of the regulations necessary to comply with them. Due to the highly infectious nature of END and the
high rate of mortality it causes among birds and poultry, we consider such knowledge a critical condition for the issuance
of a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing in both the END and the chlamydiosis regulations to provide for special permits for the movement
of restricted items interstate in any way or to any destination the regulations do not otherwise allow. Special permits
would be issued in those relatively infrequent occasions when articles could be moved without the risk of disease
spread under safeguards that are not specifically provided for in the regulations. As with permits, in the case of
interstate movements, a copy of the special permit would have to be received by both the State animal health official
and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of the shipment at the destination
listed on the special permit. A special permit would also be required for the disposal of items and the cleaning and
disinfection of items, vehicles, and premises using a method not provided in the regulations. (Provisions regarding
the issuance of special permits are set forth in proposed &sect;&sect;82.12 and 82.24.) We need to have information
in our files showing when, where, and what restricted items are being moved interstate. We also need to have information
in our files showing what items have been destroyed, or cleaned and disinfected, and the method used. This information
is important in helping us trace disease outbreaks to their source and to enforce the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the proposed permit requirements, we are proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that would allow us to deny an application for a permit or special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit and to withdraw a permit or special permit after we have issued it. (See proposed &sect;&sect;82.13, and 82.25.)
The Administrator could deny an application if he or she determines that the applicant is not complying with or could
not comply with the regulations or any special conditions needed to prevent the dissemination of END or chlamydiosis,
or, in the case of a special permit, that it is not required under the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, the Administrator may withdraw a permit or special permit, orally or in writing,
if he or she determines the person to whom the permit or special permit has been issued is violating either the regulations
or some condition specified in the permit or special permit. The Administrator could withdraw the permit or special
permit without advance notice if he or she determines that the public health, interest, or safety is threatened. The
Administrator would then provide reasons in writing why he or she denied or withdrew the permit or special permit.
The proposed provisions would also provide for an appeals process. In cases where there was a conflict as to any material
fact, the person denied the permit or special permit, or from whom a permit or special permit is withdrawn, would be
given an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial or withdrawal.

Cleaning and Disinfection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations regarding both END and chlamydiosis also require the cleaning and disinfection of vehicles,
premises, and accessories for various reasons. (See current &sect;&sect;82.3(a)(2)(ii), 82.4(d), and 82.5.)
We propose to make several changes in all of these regulations. (See proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;82.10, 82.14, 82.21, and 82.22.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we propose to replace the word ``accessories,'' wherever it is used, with the word ``equipment.'' We believe
``equipment'' is clearer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, we are proposing to clarify which functions may be carried out by an accredited veterinarian. The current
regulations have two provisions concerning cleaning and disinfecting of vehicles, premises, and equipment for
END that specify who must supervise the work. (See current &sect;&sect;82.4(d) and 82.5(a).) Section 82.4(d) states
that a Federal or State inspector must supervise. Section 82.5(a) states that a Federal or State inspector, or an accredited
veterinarian, must supervise. There is no reason why these requirements should be different. END is not endemic to
the United States. Should an outbreak occur, we and the States involved will handle it as an emergency, and send all
needed personnel to the scene. Therefore, we are proposing to amend the requirements to provide that only a Federal
or State representative may supervise cleaning and disinfection with regard to END. (See proposed &sect;&sect;82.10(c)
and 82.14 (f), (g), and (h).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that there are similar regulations concerning cleaning and disinfecting for chlamydiosis. These
regulations currently provide that a Federal or State inspector, or an accredited veterinarian, supervise cleaning
and disinfecting. (See current &sect;&sect;82.5 (a), (b), and (c).) This difference between the END regulations
and the chlamydiosis regulations exists because chlamydiosis occurs sporadically in the United States, and we handle
outbreaks on a routine basis. This type of program may require that a great number of personnel be available throughout
the country. Therefore, to ensure that personnel are available when and where they are needed, we provide in the proposed
regulations that accredited veterinarians, as well as Federal representatives and State representatives, may
supervise cleaning and disinfecting for chlamydiosis. The proposed regulations clarify what is meant by ``supervise,''
as discussed in the following paragraph, but do not change who can perform the work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulations require a Federal or State representative (or, in the case of psittacosis/ornithosis (chlamydiosis),
an accredited veterinarian) to ``supervise'' cleaning and disinfecting. It is not clear what ``supervise'' means.
We believe that requiring a Federal or State representative (or, in the case of chlamydiosis, an accredited veterinarian)
to inspect vehicles, premises, and equipment after they are cleaned, and to be present while they are disinfected,
would ensure that the cleaning and disinfecting are thorough and, therefore, effective. Accordingly, we are including
such provisions in the proposed regulations, instead of using the term ``supervise.''

and more exact. We are also proposing to remove some existing definitions and to add some new definitions to the definitions
already existing in current subpart A. This is necessary because the terms we use in the proposed regulations are not
all the same as the terms in the current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to remove the definitions of: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Director of the task force, Deputy Administrator, exposed group, Federal inspector, infected group, psittacosis
or ornithosis, State inspector,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the terms in current subpart A, except as noted above, we are proposing to include in proposed &sect;82.1
definitions of: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), dressed carcasses, exposed, Federal representative,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to those terms already defined in current &sect;82.1 for use in the psittacosis/ornithosis regulations,
we are proposing to include in proposed &sect;82.19 definitions of:

This description is outdated, and we are proposing to replace it with a description that reflects current understanding
of the disease. We would replace the reference to ``lethal avian influenza'' with a reference to ``highly pathogenic
avian influenza'' and would describe the disease as that caused by any influenza virus that results in not less than
75 percent mortality within 8 days in at least 8 healthy susceptible chickens, 4 to 8 weeks old, inoculated by the intramuscular,
intravenous, or caudal airsac route with bacteria-free infectious allantoic or cell culture fluids.

Part 71 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 71 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, contains general provisions regarding the interstate transportation
of animals and animal products. The regulations in Part 71 contain a reference to psittacosis or ornithosis. We are
proposing to amend this reference to use the updated name for the disease: chlamydiosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 71 also contains regulations concerning cleaning and disinfecting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 71.7 explains methods of cleaning and disinfecting means of conveyance, facilities, and premises. Section
71.10(a) lists ``substances permitted for use in disinfecting cars, boats, other vehicles, and premises.'' Neither
of these sections covers cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other equipment, although the cleaning and disinfectants
listed are suitable and effective for cleaning and disinfecting them. The current regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 82 (&sect;&sect;82.4(d), 82.5(b), and 82.5(c)) require coops, containers, troughs, and other ``accessories''
to be cleaned and disinfected with a disinfectant listed in &sect;71.10. We propose to retain this reference to part
71. Therefore, we are proposing to amend &sect;71.10 to state that the disinfectants listed in that section can be
used on cages and other equipment. We are also proposing to amend the cleaning and disinfection instructions in &sect;71.7
to cover cages and other equipment.

Also, the current heading for part 92 reads as follows: ``Importation of Certain Animals and Poultry and Certain Animal

In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 111&hyph;113, 114a, 115, 117, 120, 123, and 134a, the Secretary of Agriculture has the
authority to promulgate regulations and take measures to prevent the introduction into the United States and the
interstate dissemination within the United States of communicable diseases of livestock and poultry, and to pay
claims growing out of the destruction of animals. Animal health regulations promulgated by the Department under
this authority include those regarding END and chlamydiosis in 9 CFR part 82, and those regarding payment of claims
in 9 CFR part 53.

Chlamydiosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sporadic outbreaks of chlamydiosis in commercial poultry flocks have occurred in the United States over the past
decade. APHIS, working with State cooperators, has successfully eliminated chlamydiosis on each occasion. This
proposed rule includes only minor changes related to chlamydiosis, specifically the addition of a requirement for
a permit or special permit to move certain items interstate. We believe that these documents are necessary to allow
the Department to better monitor the interstate movement of the items moved. However, the economic impact from these
requirements would be negligible.

Statement of Need for Regulatory Changes Regarding END 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From the time the southern California END emergency eradication program reached its successful conclusion in 1974
(see discussion below), the U.S. poultry and egg industries have become increasingly vertically integrated. This
vertical integration has led to further concentration of poultry and egg production in specific geographic regions
of the United States. With large numbers of poultry facilities operating in close proximity to each other, there is
an increased opportunity for another major END outbreak. Current END regulations were drafted prior to the increased
level of industry concentration, and we believe they require revisions to reflect the changes that have taken place.
Current value of the domestic poultry and egg industry is estimated to be approximately $14.9 billion. Therefore,
we believe the proposed changes to the existing END regulations are necessary due to the dynamic nature of the disease
and its continued potential to devastate an important sector of U.S. agriculture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exotic birds are capable of transmitting the END virus to commercial poultry and egg flocks. Under current provisions,
APHIS routinely euthanizes entire shipments of imported birds when the END virus is detected. In the past two decades,
the domestic exotic bird industry has changed. Domestic production has intensified for those exotic species that
can be readily bred in captivity. Legal importation annually supplies the U.S. bird market with a significant number
of exotic species. The estimated value of this industry ranges between $300,000 to $500,000 annually. The actual
value of the exotic bird industry would be much higher if the value of smuggled shipments could be included in the total.
Illegal importation of exotic bird species continues to be an avenue for the introduction of END into the United States.

Proposed Rule Changes to END Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of an END outbreak, the proposed regulatory changes would have a negligible impact on the domestic poultry
and exotic bird industries. Proposed END revisions would strengthen APHIS's ability to prevent the interstate spread
of END in the event of a domestic outbreak, and in some cases relieve certain restrictions. The proposed changes include
new requirements for removing an area from quarantine; specific provisions for moving pet birds that are not known
to be infected with or exposed to END out of a quarantined area; new provisions regarding the interstate movement of
manure and litter from a quarantined area; and new provisions regarding the interstate movement of cages, coops,
and equipment from a quarantined area. A brief overview of the proposed END regulations is as follows:

Potential Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would enhance APHIS's ability to monitor interstate movement of birds and poultry from
areas quarantined because of END. Domestic poultry, egg, and exotic bird operations would be impacted only in the
event of an END outbreak. There has not been a major domestic outbreak of END since an epidemic in southern California
in 1971&hyph;74. However, END is periodically detected in isolated pet bird populations. Smuggled shipments of
exotic species are the source of most outbreaks of END. Historically, APHIS has euthanized all pet birds that are found
within a store in which birds are infected with END. The proposed rule changes would enable APHIS to be more selective
and destroy only those birds and poultry that have been diagnosed as being infected with END. We expect that the savings
to the industry from this more selective euthanization would outweigh any additional restrictions that would be
imposed by the proposed rule changes. Domestic entities would not be severely impacted by either the current regulations
or the proposed rule unless an END outbreak occurs.

Estimated Economic Impact of a Major END Outbreak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eliminating END requires the detection of the virus in a flock, appraisal, and rapid, humane destruction of the infected
flocks. It also requires that all premises that contained infected or exposed flocks be cleaned and disinfected.
Depopulation would not occur until an appraised value was determined and the owners had signed the appropriate forms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the 1971 END outbreak in southern California, there were approximately 1,115 commercial poultry and
bird flocks in that part of the State. Commercial flock populations ranged in size from approximately 1,000 to more
than 3.4 million birds and poultry. The estimated population of birds and poultry in southern California's commercial
operations totaled more than 38.9 million. The average poultry operation contained approximately 55,000 birds.
In southern California, the poultry industry was dominated by layer operations that produced table eggs for markets
in California and neighboring States. In addition to commercial flocks, there were approximately 39,960 backyard
poultry flocks with a total population of approximately 1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A national animal disease emergency was declared by the Secretary of Agriculture in March 1972, which placed the eight
southernmost counties in California under quarantine. The last case of END was diagnosed in June 1973, and surveillance
programs continued until July 1974. Eradicating END from the area required the destruction of nearly 12 million infected
and exposed birds and poultry. Most of the birds and poultry depopulated were laying hens. The effort cost approximately
$55 million. Approximately half ($27.5 million) was for indemnities paid to flock owners for poultry, birds, eggs,
and supplies destroyed. Approximately 91 percent of the depopulated birds and poultry were commercial layers, followed
by 6 percent for pullets and broilers, 1 percent each for turkeys and breeding poultry, and less than 1 percent each
for pigeons, backyard aviaries, game birds, and exotic birds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between March 1972 and December 1987, the poultry and bird population in the original quarantined area decreased
from approximately 38.9 million to 27.6 million. Conversely, the number of commercial flocks in the 1972 END quarantined
area increased from approximately 1,115 to 1,856. The increased number of bird and poultry flocks since 1972 can be
attributed to expansion of the exotic bird industry. Importers and producers of exotic birds are not as vertically
integrated as poultry producers. More exotic bird operations also helped to account for decreases in average flock
size since 1972. Additionally, increased urbanization in traditional poultry producing sections of southern California
have forced many poultry operations to close or relocate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APHIS estimates that if a similar END outbreak were to occur in southern California today, up to 7.8 million birds and
poultry could be required to be depopulated, and indemnities totaling $22.3 million dollars would be paid to producers.
Newly developed diagnostic techniques should enable APHIS to be more selective when euthanizing birds and poultry
in areas quarantined because of END. Although this should result in the destruction of fewer birds and poultry, the
actual potential impact of the proposed regulations is unknown.

Estimated Economic Impact of an Isolated END Outbreak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under APHIS regulations, all imported birds are quarantined for a minimum of 30 days to prevent the introduction of
foreign animal diseases, particularly END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exotic bird species have been imported into the United States primarily for use as pets for several decades. During
fiscal year 1991, approximately 136 lots, totaling approximately 250,000 exotic birds, were legally imported into
the United States. Only three lots were refused entry due to END. Two of these lots, totaling 827 birds, were euthanized,
the third was returned to the country of origin. APHIS estimates that the values of the euthanized lots were approximately
$8,000 and $19,500 respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to legal importation, exotic bird species are also smuggled into the United States. Birds are smuggled
for a variety of reasons, such as the avoidance of quarantine costs and illegal importation of prohibited species.
The inherent nature of smuggling makes reliable data impossible to obtain. However, APHIS estimates that the number
of smuggled birds entering the United States ranges from 100,000 to 150,000 annually. Smuggling increases the likelihood
that domestic birds and poultry could be exposed to END. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

During fiscal year 1991, an END outbreak resulted in the destruction of approximately 120 birds. APHIS estimated
the value of these euthanized birds to be approximately $40,000. Under the proposed regulations, APHIS would use
updated diagnostic techniques to determine which birds have actually been infected with END. This should permit
APHIS to be more selective when euthanasia is necessary. However, the actual potential effect of the proposed regulations
on domestic exotic bird producers is unknown.

Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APHIS estimates that the proposed rule changes for END would, short of a major END outbreak, have a negligible impact
on the daily activities of domestic poultry and egg producers, and on domestic producers and importers of exotic birds.
If a major outbreak occurred and an eradication program were initiated, the proposed rule changes would enable APHIS
to effectively prevent the interstate spread of END and eradicate END. Modern diagnostic techniques would enable
APHIS to determine which birds have been infected by the END virus. This would likely result in smaller quantities
of euthanized birds and poultry in areas quarantined because of END. We believe that revisions to the END regulations
are necessary to ensure that domestic poultry, egg, and exotic bird producers are protected against any potential
END outbreak. APHIS believes that the proposed regulations would effectively deal with a disease outbreak, while
at the same time imposing the minimum possible costs on affected entities.

(b) The determination that birds or poultry are exposed to END must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian. They will base that determination on an evaluation
of all related circumstances, including: the proximity of the birds or poultry to birds or poultry infected with END,
to excrement from birds or poultry infected with END, and to other material touched by birds or poultry infected with
END; the number of birds or poultry infected with END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; the species involved;
the virulence of the END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; and the length of time the birds or poultry were in
contact with birds or poultry infected with END, and to material touched by birds or poultry infected with END. Birds
or poultry determined to be exposed to END will continue to be treated as exposed unless they are subsequently determined
to be infected with END or until either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian finds them to be free of END based
on one or more of the factors listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Place a 1-foot layer of litter and manure in a free-standing composter bin, unless the compost pile will be covered
in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Add a 6-inch layer of straw, peanut hulls, or wood chips.
Add a layer of dead birds or dead poultry, leaving 6 inches between the carcasses and the bin walls. Add water sparingly
and cover with 6 inches of a dry mixture of litter and manure. Repeat the layering process two more times and cap with
a double layer of dry manure cake. After the bin is capped off and covered, monitor the temperature in the compost pile
daily, using a 36-inch probe-type thermometer. The temperature of the compost pile must reach at least 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. After 30 days from the date the compost pile is created, turn over to aerate the entire mixture. Allow mixture
to reach at least 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F once again. After completion of the second cycle, the mixture must remain covered with any material that prevents
penetration of air and moisture until spread or otherwise utilized. The composted material may not be spread or otherwise
utilized until at least 30 days following completion of the second heating cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Composting of birds and poultry may be accomplished outside of covered bins by following the layering and temperature
requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then covering the compost pile with tarpaulins or
6-mm polyethylene sheets anchored with tires or straw bales. The mixture must be kept moist. The final product may
not be spread or otherwise utilized until at least 30 days following completion of the second heating cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Composting of birds and poultry must be carried out at least 50 yards from any building or pen where poultry and
birds are housed and be inaccessible to birds and poultry. Composted material may not be commingled with, or otherwise
be brought into contact with, non-composted manure cake.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All eggs produced by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END in the quarantined area have been buried, reduced
to ashes by incineration, or rendered. If the eggs are buried, the eggs must be buried in the quarantined area in a location
that meets all United States Environmental Protection Agency requirements and all State and local requirements
for landfills. The eggs must be buried at least 6 feet deep and be covered at the time of burial with soil;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All manure generated by or litter used by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END in the quarantined area
has been reduced to ashes by incineration, or has been buried, composted, or spread on a field and turned under, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burial. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the manure or litter is buried, the manure and litter must be buried at least 6 feet deep and covered at the time of burial
with soil. The manure and litter must be buried in the quarantined area in a location that meets all United States Environmental
Protection Agency and State and local requirements for landfills;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Composting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the manure and litter is composted, the manure and litter must be composted in the quarantined area according to
the following method: Place the manure and litter in rows 3 to 5 feet high and 5 to 10 feet at the base. The area where the
manure, litter, and other material used in composting are placed must be such that there is no runoff from the composted
material out of the area, no saturation into the ground, and no moisture, except for that required by this paragraph,
onto the composted material from above. The composting area must be at least 50 yards from any building or pen where
birds or poultry are housed and be inaccessible to birds and poultry. The manure and litter must be mixed so as to attain
a carbon to nitrogen ratio of approximately 30:1, a moisture content of between 40 to 50 percent, and a supply of oxygen
to the composted material. If a carbon source other than manure or litter is needed, wood chips, straw, or peanut hulls
may be used. The manure and litter must be covered with tarpaulin or 6-mm polyethylene sheets, be anchored with tires
or straw bales, and be mixed to ensure adequate ventilation every 10 to 15 days. The composted material must rise to
a temperature of 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, as determined by use of a 36-inch probe-type thermometer. The composted material may not be spread or otherwise
utilized for at least 30 days from the time the 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F temperature is reached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spreading and turning under. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the manure or litter is spread on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field and turned under, the field must be in the quarantined area, at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 yards away from any building or pen where poultry or birds are housed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccessible to birds and poultry. The manure or litter must be turned under within 24 hours of being spread on the field,
and the field must be left undisturbed for at least 30 days;

an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial or withdrawal in accordance with rules
of practice adopted for the proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11,
&hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, that would have required a test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine
if the throttle lever bypasses the idle stop into the shut-off position, and modification of the throttle quadrant
or replacement of the throttle quadrant with a modified unit. That proposal was prompted by reports of unintentional
engine shutdown on certain of these airplanes. This action revises the proposed rule by requiring a different test
and eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent
inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD),
applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, was
published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5966). That NPRM would have required a test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if
the throttle lever bypasses the idle stop into the shut-off position, and modification of the throttle quadrant or
replacement of the throttle quadrant with a modified unit. That NPRM was prompted by reports of unintentional engine
shutdown on Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the issuance of that NPRM, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada,
advised the FAA of an additional unsafe condition that may exist on these, and additional, airplanes. While performing
a test of the engine throttle quadrant, one operator discovered that a quick, sharp pull of the throttle lever, combined
with contamination of the surfaces of the idle stop plate and pawl, could result in inadvertent run-through of the
lever past the idle stop and through the shut-off position. If this were to occur while the airplane was in flight or
while taxiing, it could result in the inadvertent shutdown of the engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadair has issued Challenger Service Bulletins 600&hyph;0629 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 series airplanes)
and 601&hyph;0410 (for Model CL&hyph;601&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993.
These service bulletins contain new procedures for conducting a check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant
and procedures for cleaning, retesting, and/or replacement of the throttle quadrant, if necessary. These service
bulletins also contain instructions for installing a modified throttle quadrant. Operators that have previously
accomplished the check and/or modification of the throttle quadrants in accordance with Canadair Challenger Service
Bulletin A600&hyph;0615, dated June 10, 1992 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 series airplanes), and Service
Bulletin A601&hyph;0374 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes), Revision 1, dated
September 30, 1992, must re-check and replace in accordance with the new service bulletins. The new service bulletins
list part numbers of additional affected throttle quadrants, and serial numbers of additional (Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16)
airplanes that may also be subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive
CF&hyph;92&hyph;23R1, dated March 31, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in
Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a check of the idle stop function of the throttle
quadrant, and repair or replacement of the throttle quadrant if the check fails. In addition, this proposed AD would
require the eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant with a new model. The proposed actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the new service bulletins described previously. Additionally, the applicability
of the proposed rule would be expanded to include additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since these changes expand the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to
reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 150 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed functional check of the throttle quadrant would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed functional
check on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,250, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed installation of a modified throttle quadrant would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no
cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed installation on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $82,500, or $550 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$90,750, or $605 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished
any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the East
Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA. The intended effect of this action is to allow aircraft executing
the Runway 6 Back Course Instrument Approach at the Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, MA (ACK) to remain in controlled
airspace at lower altitudes. This change would allow air traffic control to avoid unnecessary vectoring of aircraft
using the Runway 6 Back Course approach to keep those aircraft in controlled airspace. Since approximately 22% of
aircraft arriving at ACK use the Runway 6 approach, this change would result in improved air traffic control services
to over 6,000 aircraft per year. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations
for Low Control Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Offshore Airspace Area designation listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) Is
not a ``Significant Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 9, 1994, the Commission proposed for public comment amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and a new rule, Rule 15c2&hyph;13
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33743, 59 FR 12767). Those proposals
expanded the information that brokers, dealers, and municipal securities would be required to disclose on a customer
confirmation. The proposals are designed to aid investors in monitoring their securities transactions and update
the Commission's confirmation requirements to reflect changes in the securities markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time these proposals were published, the Commission established a 90-day comment period that expired on June
15, 1994. The Commission has received several requests from interested persons to extend the comment period. In light
of the complex issues raised by these proposals and the need to solicit the views of as many persons who will be affected
by the proposals as possible, the Commission is extending the comment period 30 days. Accordingly, the comment period
is extended to July 15, 1994.

The proposed revisions include additions and modifications to subpart S, part 51, title 40, Code of Federal Regulations,
regarding State Implementation Plan submissions for purposes of redesignation. The proposed revisions specify
SIP requirements only for areas that are subject to the basic Inspection/Maintenance program requirement and that
otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment for the carbon monoxide or ozone national
ambient air quality standards. This rule proposes to allow such areas to defer adoption and implementation of some
of the otherwise applicable requirements established in the original promulgation of the Inspection/Maintenance
rule. This proposed rule applies only to areas that by virtue or their air quality classification are required to implement
a basic I/M program and that submit, and otherwise qualify for, a redesignation request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act), states that an area can be redesignated to attainment
if the following conditions are met: EPA has determined that the national ambient air quality standards have been
attained; EPA has fully approved the applicable implementation plan under section 110(k); EPA has determined that
the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions due to the implementation
plan and other permanent and enforceable reductions; the State has met all applicable requirements of section 110
and part D; and, EPA has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area under section 175A of the Act. Section 175A in
turn requires states that submit a redesignation request to submit a plan, and any additional measures if necessary,
for maintenance of the air quality standard, for a least a 10 year period following EPA's approval of the redesignation.
It also requires the plan to include contingency provisions to ensure prompt correction of any violation of the standard
which occurs after redesignation. The contingency measures must include a provision requiring the state to implement
measures which were contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) prior to redesignation as an attainment area.

The purpose of this document is to propose amendments to the rules in subpart S of part 51 of title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (subpart S) to address Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program requirements for basic areas that qualify
for and will ultimately obtain approval by EPA of redesignation requests to attainment. This notice proposes to add
a new paragraph to the regulation pertaining to State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions for areas required to
implement a basic I/M program that are submitting and otherwise qualify for approval of a redesignation request.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 There are basic areas that will be submitting redesignation requests that do not currently have I/M programs, or have
either a basic program implemented pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act or a basic program upgraded to meet the
requirements of EPA's I/M regulations. This rule applies only to areas that by virtue of their air quality classification
are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit, and otherwise qualify for a redesignation request.

In a May 6, 1994 decision, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that EPA did not have authority to construe section 110(k)(4)
to authorize conditional approval of an I/M committal SIP that contains no specific enforceable measures, but a promise
to adopt specific enforceable measures within a year. Merely, section 110(k)(4) states that: The Administrator
may approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain,
but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Any such conditional approval shall be treated
as a disapproval if the State fails to comply with such commitment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This decision was based on the premise that the statute required all areas required to implement an I/M program to have
adopted regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority for this rulemaking is not based on section 110(k)(4), but on sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4),
which applies only to areas required to submit basic I/M programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4) of the Act, basic I/M areas must submit a SIP revision that includes
any ``provisions necessary to provide for a vehicle inspection and maintenance program'' of no less stringency than
either the program that was in the SIP at the time of passage of the Act or the minimum basic program requirements, whichever
is more stringent. Basic areas have a nominal requirement only for a schedule for implementation pursuant to section
172(b)(11)(B) of the 1977 Amendments and sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4) of the 1990 Amendments, plus any
other requirements established by EPA in guidance. The statutory language of section 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and section
182(b)(4) provides a degree of flexibility compared with the statutory language in section 182(c)(3), which requires
enhanced I/M areas to submit a SIP revision ``to provide for an enhanced program''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although for most purposes EPA will continue to interpret ``provisions to provide for'' a basic I/M program to require
full adoption and expeditious implementation of such a program, EPA believes based on this flexible language, that
it is appropriate to revise the SIP revisions requirements applicable to basic I/M areas that ultimately will qualify
for redesignation. For states which have attained the ambient standard with the benefit of only the current program,
or no program at all, EPA does not believe it is necessary to revise or adopt new regulations and undertake other significant
planning efforts which are not essential for clean air, and which would not be implemented after redesignation occurred
because they are not necessary for maintenance. It would be a wasteful exercise to force the state to go through full
adoption of regulations only to have these regulations converted to a contingency measure the moment the redesignation
is approved. EPA believes that such states need not submit an actual I/M program as long as there are ``provisions necessary
to provide'' for an I/M program as required by statute. For areas that qualify for redesignation to attainment and
ultimately are redesignated, EPA is proposing to amend Subpart S to interpret that statutory phrase to allow such
areas to be redesignated if they otherwise qualify for redesignation and submit a SIP that contains the following
four elements: (1) Legal authority for a basic I/M program (or an enhanced program if the state chooses to opt up), meeting
all of the requirements of Subpart S such that implementing regulations can be adopted without further legislation;
(2) a request to place the I/M plan or upgrades (as applicable) in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance
plan upon redesignation as described in the fourth element below; (3) a contingency measure consisting of a commitment
by the Governor or the Governor's designee to adopt regulations to implement the I/M program in response to a specified
triggering event; and (4) a commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adopting and implementing the I/M
program, including appropriate milestones, in the event the contingency measure is triggered (milestones shall
be defined by states in terms of months since the triggering event). EPA believes that for areas that otherwise qualify
for redesignation a SIP meeting these four requirements would satisfy the obligation to submit ``provisions to provide''
for a satisfactory I/M program, as required by the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without these amendments states that are being redesignated to attainment would have to adopt a full I/M program for
the purpose of obtaining full approval of their SIPs as meeting all applicable SIP requirements, which is a prerequisite
for approval of a redesignation request. Once redesignated these states could discontinue implementation of this
program as long as it was converted to a contingency measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these amendments the determination of whether a state fulfills the SIP requirements will depend, for the purposes
of redesignation approval only, on whether the state meets the four requirements listed above. EPA believes that
this flexibility is built into the basic I/M requirement and should apply only for the limited purpose of considering
a redesignation request to attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be understood, however, that, pursuant to section 175A(c), while EPA considers the redesignation request,
the state continues to be required to meet all the requirements of this subpart. This would include the submission
of another SIP revision meeting the existing requirements for fully adopted rules and the specific implementation
deadline applicable to the area as required under 40 CFR 51.372 or the I/M rule. If the state does not comply with these
requirements it could be subject to sanctions pursuant to section 179. Because the possibility for sanctions exists,
states which do not have a solid basis for approval of the redesignation request and maintenance plan should proceed
to fully prepare and plan to implement a basic I/M program that meets all the requirements of Subpart S.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIP revision must demonstrate that the performance standard in either 40 CFR 53.351 or 51.352 will be met using
an evaluation date (rounded to the nearest January for carbon monoxide and July for hydrocarbons) seven years after
the trigger date. Emission standards for vehicles subject to an IM240 test may be phased in during the program but full
standards must be in effect for at least one complete test cycle before the end of the five year period. All other requirements
shall take effect within 24 months of the trigger date. Furthermore, a state may not discontinue implementation of
an I/M program until the redesignation request and maintenance plan (that does not rely on reductions from I/M) are
finally approved. If the redesignation request is approved, any sanctions already imposed, or any sanctions clock
already triggered, would be terminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are four possible scenarios under which an area might present a redesignation request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Areas Without Operating I/M Programs_Section 182(b)(4) of the Act expanded the requirement for submission of
a schedule for a basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

I/M program to all moderate ozone nonattainment areas. As a result, about 25 new cities were affected by the I/M requirement.
Since passage of the Act however, some of these areas have experienced no violation of the standard and are in a position
to submit a request to redesignate. Some of these areas may be able to demonstrate maintenance of the standards without
implementation of an I/M program.

The proposed changes to Subpart S would allow a state to avoid having to prepare a detailed I/M plan and adopt regulations
at this time. EPA would require a detailed implementation plan and regulations would be required by EPA to be submitted
and incorporated into the previous SIP within 12 months and implemented within 24 months from the triggering event
as specified by the State. Section 175A(d) requires that each maintenance plan revision contain contingency provisions
necessary to assure that the State will ``promptly correct'' any violation of the standard which occurs after the
redesignation of an area to attainment. Given the time needed for states to submit and incorporate these measures
into the previous SIP and then implement them, EPA believes that these 12 and 24 month time periods are the minimum amount
of time in which states can ``promptly correct'' the violation which triggered the contingency measure. These time
periods are based on EPA's interpretation of a reasonable amount of time to allow the State to submit and implement
a new SIP after the triggering event.

2. Basic areas With Operating I/M Programs_Continued Operation Without Upgrades. Section 182(a)(2)(B)(ii) of
the Act requires EPA to ``review, revise, update, and republish'' I/M guidance. EPA did so on November 5, 1992 (as reflected
in subpart S) and established new requirements for basic and enhanced I/M programs. These regulations require improved
administration of the I/M program in a variety of ways and to meet the performance standard established for basic programs.
Some of these areas may be in a position to redesignate to attainment based on a maintenance plan which does not implement
these upgrades. EPA believes that its broad authority under section 182(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act to revise the guidance
for basic I/M areas allows it to structure subpart S such that a redesignation request could be approved for such areas
that continue to operate I/M programs provided that the state has the legal authority and regulations necessary to
make the upgrade, and submits as a contingency measure a commitment to implement the upgrade in the event of a violation,
according to an enforceable schedule, including milestones. The maintenance plan could not, however, claim the
full credit provided by the MOBILE model unless the upgrade was implemented. The purpose of the upgrade is to ensure
that the emission reduction benefits projected by the MOBILE model are in fact achieved in practice. The MOBILE model
is used to determine emission level targets and whether the local I/M program design meets the performance standard
as described in 40 CFR 51.351 or 51.352 of subpart S. Areas which continue operation of I/M programs as part of their
maintenance plan without an implemented upgrade shall be assumed to be 80% as effective as an implemented upgraded
version of the same I/M program design, unless a state can demonstrate using operating information that the I/M program
alone is more effective than the implemented upgraded version. The 80% benefit assumption is based on a 20% discount
for the lack of administrative requirements, especially quality assurance and quality control, not modeling factors.
The model does not include inputs for quality control and quality assurance.

3. Areas With Operating I/M Programs_Continuing Operation With Upgrades. If an area chooses to upgrade the I/M program
to meet the requirements of subpart S rather than to take advantage of the amendment proposed today, then a full SIP
submission as specified in &sect;51.372 of subpart S shall be made that addresses those requirements. In this case,
a state can claim full MOBILE model credit for the implemented upgrade in the maintenance plan as of its effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Areas With Operating I/M Programs_Discontinuing Operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Areas which receive approval of the redesignation request may cease operation of the I/M program after this approval
if and only if the following requirements are met. First, a modeling demonstration must be included in the maintenance
plan which shows the standards can be maintained without the program, and second, the I/M program must be transferred
by SIP revision to the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan and implemented as a contingency measure
in the event of a triggering condition. Emission reduction credit cannot be claimed in the maintenance plan if an I/M
program is to cease operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal does not affect redesignation requests submitted for serious or worse ozone or carbon monoxide areas,
moderate CO areas above 12.7 ppm, and for areas claiming full maintenance plan credits for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
I/M program without supporting evidence of emission reduction credits. Those areas must meet all the requirements
of subpart S. This is because section 182(c)(3) of the Act does not provide the flexibility granted under section 182(b)(4)
and explicitly requires areas subject to the enhanced I/M requirement to submit a full I/M program including regulations
and implementation requirements.

Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, not
subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. A small entity may include a small government entity or
jurisdiction. A small government jurisdiction is defined as ``governments of cities, counties, towns, townships,
villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than 50,000''. This certification is
based on the fact that the I/M areas impacted by the rule do not meet the definition of a small government jurisdiction,
that is, ``governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts,
with a population of less than 50,000''. It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action
under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. This rule would only relieve states
of some regulatory requirements, not add costs or otherwise adversely affect the economy.

. Any nonattainment area that EPA determines would otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment
may receive full approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal under sections 182(a)(2)(B) or 182(b)(4)
if the submittal contains the following elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Legal authority to implement a basic I/M program (or enhanced if the state chooses to opt up) as required by this
subpart. The legislative authority for an I/M program shall allow the adoption of implementing regulations without
requiring further legislation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A request to place the I/M plan (if no I/M program is currently in place or if an I/M program has been terminated) or
the I/M upgrade (if the existing I/M program is to continue without being upgraded) into the contingency measures
portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or the governor's designee to adopt regulations
to implement the required I/M program in response to a specified triggering event. Such contingency measures must
be implemented on the trigger date, which is a date determined by the State to be no later than the date EPA notifies the
state that it is in violation of the ozone or carbon monoxide standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adoption and implementation of the I/M program, and appropriate
milestones, including the items in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(vii) of this section. In addition, the
schedule shall include the date for submission of a SIP meeting all of the requirements of this subpart, excluding
schedule requirements. Schedule milestones shall be listed in months from the trigger date, and shall comply with
the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. SIP submission shall occur no more than 12 months after the trigger
date as specified by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Basic areas continuing operation of I/M programs as part of their maintenance plan without implemented upgrades
shall be assumed to be 80% as effective as an implemented, upgraded version of the same I/M program design, unless a
state can demonstrate using operating information that the I/M program is more effective than the 80% level.

SIP Submittals to Correct Violations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submissions required pursuant to a violation of the ambient ozone or CO standard (as discussed in paragraph (c)
of this section) shall address all of the requirements of this subpart. The SIP shall demonstrate that performance
standards in either &sect;51.351 or &sect;51.352 shall be met using an evaluation date (rounded to the nearest January
for carbon monoxide and July for hydrocarbons) seven years after the trigger date. Emission standards for vehicles
subject to an IM240 test may be phased in during the program but full standards must be in effect for at least one complete
test cycle before the end of the 5-year period. All other requirements shall take effect within 24 months of the trigger
date. The phase-in allowances of &sect;51.373(c) shall not apply.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of Oregon for the contingency measure plan for carbon monoxide (CO). The implementation plan was submitted
by the state to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for Grants Pass, Medford, Portland, and Klamath
Falls, Oregon. In the Final Rules Section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments,
the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice.

 Olin Corp., 350 Knotter Drive, P.O. Box 586, Cheshire, CT 06410-0586, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4325 to
EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
(21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct (CAS Reg. No. 102900-02-7) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest under 40 CFR 180.1001(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene)
monoalkyl(C

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct conforms to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the
following criteria that are used to identify low-risk polymers: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)ether-sodium fumerate adduct is 1,900. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed
through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through
the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable
of eliciting a toxic response.

practice this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes
that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

the PHS to assume responsibility for ensuring that the financial interests of the employees of the Institution do
not compromise the objectivity with which such research is designed, conducted, or reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rules, investigators are required to disclose to an official(s) designated by the Institution
a listing of Significant Financial Interests. The institutional official(s) will review these disclosures in accordance
with an administrative process to be established by each institution. Following this review, the institutional
official(s) will determine the acceptability of the reported financial interests and act to protect PHS-funded
research from any bias that is reasonably expected to arise from those interests.

Technology Transfer and Conflict of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Effective interaction between PHS-funded Institutions conducting research and industry is essential to ensure
the rapid application of scientific discoveries to the health needs of the Nation and to maintain the international
competitiveness of domestic industry. Nonetheless, prudent stewardship of public funds includes protecting Federally
funded research from being compromised by the conflicting financial interests of any Investigator responsible
for the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous statutes and programs demonstrate the Federal interest in the promotion of interactions among Government,
academia and industry. For example, the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (Public Law (P.L.) 96&hyph;480)
encourages technology transfer, particularly through industrial-academic collaborations. The Patent and Trademark
Act Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96&hyph;517) allow universities and other funding recipients to apply for patents developed
with Federal funding, and expressly promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations.
The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (P.L. 97&hyph;34) is aimed at fostering research and development by small companies
and associated university partners. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (P.L. 99&hyph;502), which amended
P.L. 96&hyph;480, and Executive Order 12592 provide similar patent and licensing authority to Federal laboratories,
and encourage them to participate in cooperative research and development agreements with the private sector and
nonprofit organizations, including universities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These legal authorities facilitate the movement of intellectual capital between the Federal Government, academic
institutions, and the private sector. This kind of cross-fertilization is critical to the development of the U.S.
biotechnology industry. However, these and other inducements for collaboration, as well as the rapid growth of the
biotechnology industry, have created a climate in which the stewardship of public funding for biomedical and behavioral
research is increasingly complex and challenging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the results of PHS-funded research to the health and the economy of the Nation must not be compromised by
any financial interest that will, or may be reasonably expected to, bias the design, conduct or reporting of the research.
The proposed regulations seek to maintain a reasonable balance between these competing interests, give applicants
for PHS research funding responsibility and discretion to identify and manage financial interests that may bias
the research, and minimize reporting and other burdens on the applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulations are the result of a lengthy process of consideration. Throughout that process, the PHS has
carefully considered and changed its approach in response to public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 27 and 28, 1989, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA) sponsored an open meeting to discuss issues related to financial conflict of interest. At that meeting there
was general agreement that an Institution that receives research funds from a PHS Awarding Component should develop
policies to identify and manage any financial conflict of interest in the funded research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 15, 1989, the NIH and ADAMHA published a Request for Comment on Proposed Guidelines for Policies on Conflict
of Interest in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Volume 18, Number 32). Seven hundred fifty-one responses were received from individuals associated with medical
schools, other academic and research institutions, biotechnology companies, local governments, and non-profit
organizations; venture capitalists; attorneys; biomedical journal editors; Federal employees and contractors
at Government facilities; and others. In general, those submitting comments were concerned that the proposed guidelines
imposed undue burdens on funded institutions and would impede mutually beneficial research collaboration between
universities and industry. In response to these comments, the Secretary determined that regulations should be developed
that would address those concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public meeting was held at NIH on November 30, 1990, to discuss further the regulation of financial conflict of interest
by the PHS. The 18 written comments received at that time reflected views similar to those received earlier.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents to earlier proposals stated that the primary responsibility for setting guidelines and maintaining
compliance should rest with each awardee Institution. The present proposed rule, like PHS policy in other areas involving
protection of the public interest (such as the protection of human subjects in research and the investigation of alleged
scientific misconduct), sets standards for performance and assigns the primary responsibility for procedural
development and compliance to the Institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of those commenting on prior proposals agreed with the importance of disclosure, but thought that the requirement
to disclose all financial interests, as set forth in the previously proposed guidelines, should be reduced in scope
to prevent needless invasion of privacy and creation of paperwork burdens. The proposed regulations achieve this
end by limiting the disclosures that must be made to ``Significant Financial Interests,'' any interest of monetary
value exceeding a defined threshold of value ($5,000) or percentage of ownership (five percent or more) that would
reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS or proposed for funding.
PHS specifically requests public comment on whether the minimum threshold for disclosure is appropriate to ensure
that PHS-funded research projects are not biased by conflicting financial interests of those responsible for the
design, conduct, or reporting of the research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a wide range of opinion among those commenting on previous proposals regarding which types of financial
interest should be permissible. In these proposed rules a Significant Financial Interest (defined in &sect;50.603)
of the type specified in &sect;50.605(a) must be managed as provided in &sect;50.605(b) and the existence and management,
reduction, or elimination of that financial interest must be certified in the application. The PHS may at any time
request submission of, or review on site, all records pertinent to the certification. This procedure gives Institutions
broad discretion in determining how to manage Significant Financial Interests that reasonably appear to directly
and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research while providing for appropriate PHS oversight.
PHS may undertake periodic reviews of the records in order to assess the reliability of institutional and investigator
certifications, and to determine whether institutional safeguards do, in fact, protect the integrity of PHS-funded
research. In undertaking any such review HHS will coordinate, to the extent feasible, with the National Science Foundation
(NSF) to ensure that institutions are not unnecessarily subjected to multi-agency reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Managing potential conflicts carefully; avoiding unnecessary burden and useless paperwork; and preserving appropriate
incentives for productive research represent challenges individually and collectively. Even after we issue a final
rule some unforeseen problems will certainly emerge. Therefore, approximately one year after the final rule is issued
we plan to initiate an evaluation, to include a conference and other mechanisms to consult with investigators and
institutions. Based on that evaluation, we would revise these rules if and as appropriate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Types of Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations implement section 493A of the PHS Act, added by Public Law 103&hyph;43, which mandates the
issuance of regulations defining, and setting standards for, the management of financial interests that will, or
may be reasonably expected to, bias a clinical research project whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness
of a drug, medical device, or treatment. In addition, the proposed regulations implement section 924 of the PHS Act,
as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, which requires the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
(AHCPR) to issue regulations defining the financial interests that will, or may be reasonably expected to, create
a bias in the health care services research projects funded by the AHCPR. The proposed regulations are not limited
to the implementation of these statutory authorities, however. Pursuant to the Secretary's authority to issue regulations
governing those who seek or receive PHS funding, they apply broadly to all research funded by the PHS, whether under
the authority of the PHS Act or other statutes, except Phase I projects under the Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Program. Very limited amounts of funding are provided under Phase I of the SIBR Program to plan and determine
the feasibility of the research project for further funding under Phase II. Because potentially biasing financial
interests will be assessed at the time of the Phase II application, it would be burdensome and unproductive to require
such a review for Phase I applications. With this exception, it is believed that financial interests can create a bias
in all types of research, although the likelihood of such a bias may diminish if the outcome of the research would have
little effect on the commercial potential of any product, device, or other property in which the Investigator may
have a financial interest. However, this distinction can not be so clearly drawn that the need to protect the integrity
of all PHS-funded research uniformly is alleviated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual vs. Institutional Financial Interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed regulations provide for the disclosure and consideration of the financial interests of individuals
involved in the design, conduct, and reporting of the research. Section 493A of the PHS Act, added by Public Law 103&hyph;43,
refers to financial interests of entities (e.g., institutions), as well as individuals, in clinical research projects.
We are considering the following alternatives with respect to the coverage of institutions that apply for clinical
research funding under the PHS Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Exempting Institutional Financial Interests That Would Not Bias the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under the statute, adoption of this alternative would be based on a determination that the exempted institutional
financial interests would not be reasonably expected to bias the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research.
This conclusion might be based on a finding that the limited size of the interest would preclude any biasing effect,
or a finding that the institutional financial interest would have only an indirect and unpredictable effect on the
project, in the absence of a personal financial interest on the part of those responsible for the design, conduct or
reporting of the research. There would, of course, have to be a reasonable factual basis for such findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) Requiring Institutional Applicants To Certify Whether They Have Significant Financial Interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adoption of this alternative would involve establishing a procedure for institutions similar to the procedure in
the proposed regulation for individuals. This option would be based on the same rationale as the preceding option,
i.e. that there is no need to regulate institutional financial interests that aren't reasonably expected to bias
the conduct of the research. Significant Financial Interest might be defined for institutions as limited only to
direct financial interests (such as a patent application on, or a financial arrangement with a company regarding,
the product of the research). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) Requiring Full Disclosure to the PHS of the Financial Interests of Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This alternative would impose a reporting burden upon the institutions, but would ensure a complete PHS review of
any potential conflict of interest prior to a funding decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
(4) Other Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We will also consider combinations of these three alternatives and other alternatives that may be suggested in the
public comments. We will choose an alternative based on the requirements of the statute, and, to the extent consistent
with the statute, based upon our weighing of the burdens on the institutions, the potential that institutional financial
interests will bias PHS-funded research, and the potential adverse effect of the alternative upon technology transfer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

c. Types of Interests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed regulations require disclosure of ``significant financial interests'' of the Investigator that would
reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS or proposed for funding
or of the investigator in an entity whose financial interest would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly
affected by the PHS research. The following are examples of the types of significant financial interests that would
fall within the categories in &sect;50.605: ownership of stock, stock options, or any equity, debt, security, capital
holding, salary or other remuneration, or financial consideration, or thing of value for services as an employee,
consultant, officer, or board member in (1) any business enterprise, including the applicant for PHS funds (except
SBIR applicants are not included), that owns or has applied for the patent, manufacturing or marketing rights to a
drug, vaccine, device, procedure or any other product involved in or that will predictably result from the research
described in the application or (2) a business enterprise that is known by the investigator to own or have applied for
such rights in any product that can reasonably be expected to compete with the product or procedure that will predictably
result from the research described in the application. We request comments on a range of disclosures that would on
the one hand, include interests that may threaten objectivity; and, on the other exclude those interests that cannot
reasonably be regulated or that are so obvious as not to warrant regulations. We also request comments on whether specific
examples of biasing significant financial interests, such as those set forth above, should be included in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, we request comments on whether interests in a business enterprise that is known by the investigator
to have an interest in a product that competes with the product involved in the application should fall within the categories
of significant financial interests described in &sect;50.605. There may not be any reasonable way for an investigator
either to identify all competing products or to determine what companies own them. For example, for most medical devices
there may be dozens of competing products, many made by subsidiaries of ``Fortune 500'' conglomerates. How would
an investigator determine just what products were ``competing''? Should we be concerned if an investigator owns
$5,000 of stock in a company in which only a small fraction of revenues and profits derive from the competing product?
We request comments on whether, and how best, to cover interests in competing products.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We also request comments on whether an employee's stock or other non-salary financial interests in the applicant
institution should be covered. This is of particular relevance when the grant or contract is with a for-profit enterprise.
Specifically, should we be concerned, and how could we expect the company to ``manage'' against conflict, when the
company's employees obviously stand to benefit if the product is a commercial success? The proposed rule includes
an exemption for an ownership interest in the institution if it is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) applicant.
Can we justify exempting SBIR awards and not all other awards to both large and small profit-making enterprises? Should
we exempt from disclosure any equity or ownership interest in the applicant institution? Should we exempt disclosure
of interests other than bonuses or other compensation tied to the outcome of the research? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
II. Burdens Upon Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed regulation is intended to minimize reporting and other burdens upon applicants to the maximum extent
feasible. Certain types or amounts of financial interests that cannot be reasonably expected to bias the research
are excluded from the requirements for disclosure by investigators. Such interests are also excluded from the certification
of whether these are Significant Financial Interests that must accompany each application. Even when there is a Significant
Financial Interest of the type specified in the proposed rule, the institutions are given broad discretion in managing
the conflict; details of the interest need not be reported to the PHS awarding component. It is the responsibility
of that component to determine whether to review the institutional records relating to the disclosure and management
of that interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will also seek to reduce burdens upon applicants by being available to provide advice and assistance
as applicants establish the policies and procedures required by this subpart. The PHS Awarding Components will be
available to respond to general inquiries regarding compliance with this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another way of reducing burdens upon applicants is to exempt certain types of applicants from the requirements or
to impose different, less burdensome requirements on them. The proposed &sect;50.602 provides that the regulations
do not apply to SBIR Phase I applications and that where the applicant for a research grant is an individual, determinations
of the procedures to be followed to ensure the objectivity of the research will be made on a case-by-case basis. The
National Science Foundation (NSF) exempts from its Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy that is being published
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grantees employing fifty persons or less. Comment on whether HHS should adopt a similar exclusion is requested. Our
experiences with conflict of interest situations indicate that investigators working for small entities may be
just as subject to conflicts of interest as investigators working at large institutions. The interests of appropriate
coverage and of reducing burdens might both be served by determining the procedures to be followed by small entities
on a case-by-case basis as is proposed for individuals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Uniform Federal Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have been working closely with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to ensure that this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
and the policy published by NSF in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be consistent, and will impose the same obligations on funding recipients. In addition, HHS has been working
with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office Management and Budget, NSF, and other interested agencies
to develop and propose a common Federal policy on investigator conflicts of interest. It is expected that this policy,
when completed, will ensure consistent treatment of investigator conflicts issues by all Federal funding agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the statutes described above have necessitated some inconsistencies between these proposed regulations
and the policy being published by the NSF. Unlike the NSF policy, there is no provision permitting institutions to
waive the management, reduction, or elimination of an actual or potential conflicting interest when such action
would be either ineffective or inequitable, and the potential negative impacts that might arise from the conflicting
interest are outweighed by interests of scientific progress, technology transfer, or the public health and welfare.
Because section 493A of the Public Health Service Act requires institutions conducting PHS-funded clinical research
projects to manage or eliminate financial interests that would potentially bias the project, we do not believe HHS
has the discretion to permit institutions to waive this requirement. Similarly, section 493A necessitates the requirements
for institutional notification of the PHS Awarding Component in &sect;50.604(a)(7)(ii) and (8). In addition, the
statute specifically requires the announcement, with each public presentation of the research, of a conflicting
financial interest that was not managed, reduced, or eliminated, as set forth in &sect;50.606(d). This requirement
is limited to PHS-funded clinical research projects, but the requirements of institutional notification to the
PHS have not been so limited, because we believe that such notification serves a useful purpose for all PHS-funded
research, and that disparate reporting requirements for different types of research would cause confusion and create
burdens for the institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that ``management of a financial interest that could potentially bias a project'' may include
recognition by the institution that a potential conflict exists, and monitoring progress of the research to insure
that the financial interest does not bias the project. The Department specifically requests comment on whether this
interpretation maximizes consistency between this NPRM and the NSF's final policy, in the light of the statutory
distinctions discussed above. The Department seeks comment on whether this expansion of the statutory requirement
is appropriate in the context of PHS-funded research and the need to minimize burden on institutions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Relationship to Other Laws
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many Institutions funded by the PHS Awarding Components are State Institutions whose employees are subject to State
laws designed to prevent financial conflict of interest. The proposed rules would not supplant these requirements
and are intended to be applied in addition to other applicable Federal and State restrictions related to potential
financial conflicts of interest, including Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit trading in securities
with knowledge of privileged or non-public information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide for enforcement remedies both against researchers that fail to comply with institutional
policies issued under the regulation and Institutions that fail to comply with the regulation. The proposed rules
specifically state that the requirements constitute a condition of award and as such could be enforced through the
suspension or termination of a grant or cooperative agreement. A Termination for Convenience or a Stop Work Order
could be issued in accordance with the FAR if a contractor fails to enforce the Special Standards. Each contractor
would be required to meet the specified responsibility requirements prior to award of a contract. PHS awarding components
will work diligently with applicants to resolve compliance problems informally, to avoid the need for formal enforcement
action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments, and communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materially alter the budgetary impact of grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, if
the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons outlined below, we do not believe this rule is economically significant nor do we believe that it will have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, this rule is not inconsistent with the
actions of any other agency. However, we recognize that there are potential inconsistencies depending on what other
agencies may later propose. Several agencies are now considering issuing policies on what circumstances are likely
to lead to bias in research that is funded or relied upon by the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any rule in this area has the potential to inhibit socially beneficial research, and to hamper the technological progress
so essential to the American economy and to the advance of science. We are further mindful of the importance of the requirements
in Executive Order 12866 that any new regulatory system be based on a showing that there is a significant problem requiring
regulation, that regulatory priorities be based on the degree and nature of risks, and that regulations be designed
to be cost-effective. Moreover, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires us to minimize adverse effects not only
on small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, but also on almost all non-profit entities including universities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the hearings that preceded enactment of the requirement in the NIH Revitalization Act, known cases were described
in which scientists have stood to make large sums of money contingent on the positive outcome of research on a particular
product, where this fact was not known to those reviewing the research, and where bias did occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have drafted this rule to address these instances of abuse, while minimizing unnecessary burden to researchers.
We did not consider any option that would routinely require all researchers to list all of their significant assets
(unrelated to the research project), that would encourage searches for hypothetical or speculative conflicts,
that would require divestiture of ownership of a product undergoing research, or that would discourage in any way
funding grants or contracts to scientists to develop products with significant profit potential. We have not inhibited
research in any way, other than requiring that it be managed to assure that potential bias is minimized. Such management
methods are common in the sciences and impose no undue burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We request comment on whether there are any provisions of the proposed rule that might inadvertently hamper socially
desirable research. For example, we have proposed allowing institutions to require that researcher employees divest
themselves of stock in companies owning products undergoing research. Conversely, if there are other types of situations
in which a financial conflict of interest has a substantial risk of biasing research results, we will consider expanding
the scope of the rule. We ask that commenters provide evidence as to magnitude and frequency of any claimed adverse
effects or loopholes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that the annual costs of implementing this rule will reach as much as $1,000 an institution in staff
time, or as much as $1 million a year across all institutions. Most of the cost will arise from the several seconds or
minutes spent certifying the absence of significant financial interests for individual awards. Spread across thousands
of grantee and contractor institutions, these costs are infinitesimal. Therefore, we have determined that this
rule would not create an ``unfunded mandate'' imposed on state-owned institutions and would not trigger the requirements
of Executive Order 12875, on ``Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these same reasons, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, and that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules contain information collection requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Appropriate instructions for making certifications
to the PHS Awarding Components will be issued as an addendum to the instructions for applications for PHS research
funding. It is contemplated that the certification will be provided by checking a box on the application. The title,
description, and respondent description applicable to the information collection are shown below with an estimate
of the annual reporting and record-keeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information.

This subpart is applicable to each Institution that applies for PHS grants or cooperative agreements for research
and, through the implementation of this subpart by each Institution, to each Investigator participating in research
covered by this subpart; provided, that this subpart does not apply to SBIR Program Phase I applications. In those
few cases where an individual, rather than an institution, is an applicant for PHS grants or cooperative agreements
for research, PHS Awarding Components will make case-by-case determinations on the steps to be taken to ensure that
the design, conduct, and reporting of the research will not be biased by any Significant Financial Interest of the
individual.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each Institution must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Inform each Investigator of the Institution's policy for identifying and managing Significant Financial Interests,
the Investigator's reporting responsibilities, and of this subpart.

planning to participate in PHS-funded research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ensure that Investigators have provided to the designated official(s) a listing of Significant Financial Interests
that ensures disclosure of all Significant Financial Interests of the type described in &sect;50.605(a) prior to
the time an application is submitted to PHS. All financial disclosures must be updated during the pendency of the award,
either on an annual basis, or as new reportable Significant Financial Interests are obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provide guidelines consistent with this subpart for the designated official(s) to identify Significant Financial
Interests of the type described in &sect;50.605(a) and take such actions as necessary to ensure that any such financial
interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be managed, reduced, or eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maintain records, identifiable to each award, of all financial disclosures and all actions taken by the Institution
with respect to each Significant Financial Interest of the type described in &sect;50.605 for at least three years
beyond the termination or completion of the award, or until resolution of any action by the HHS involving the records,
whichever is longer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Establish procedures for resolving any alleged violation of the financial conflict of interest policy of the
Institution and establish appropriate enforcement action for failure to comply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Certify, in each application for the funding to which this subpart applies, that; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There is in effect at that Institution a written and enforced administrative process to identify and manage, reduce
or eliminate Significant Financial Interests of the type described in &sect;50.605(a) with respect to all research
projects for which funding is sought from the PHS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Institution either has, or has not found a Significant Financial Interest of the type described in &sect;50.606
and, where such interest is found, certify that actions will be taken prior to the award of funding to manage, reduce
or eliminate that interest in accordance with this subpart; and that the Institution will notify the PHS Awarding
Component of such action prior to issuance of the Notice of Grant Award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Institution agrees to make information available, upon request, to the HHS regarding all Significant Financial
Interests identified by the Institution of the type described in &sect;50.605 and how those interests have been managed,
reduced, or eliminated to protect the research from bias; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Institution will otherwise comply with this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) (i) Notify the PHS Awarding Component of the identification and management, reduction or elimination of any Significant
Financial Interest of the type described in &sect;50.605 that originates or becomes known to the institution after
the grant or cooperative agreement has been awarded, within sixty days of its becoming aware of that interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) Institutions applying for PHS funding for research shall ensure that the following types of Significant Financial
Interests attributable to an Investigator are managed, reduced, or eliminated, in accordance with paragraph (b)
of this section, prior to award of the grant: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any Significant Financial Interest of the Investigator that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly
affected by the research funded by PHS, or proposed for funding; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any Significant Financial Interest of the Investigator in an entity whose financial Interest would reasonably
appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS, or proposed for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the types of Significant Financial Interests described in this paragraph that must be managed,
an Institution may require the management of other financial interests as the Institution deems appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The designated official(s) must review all financial disclosures, determine whether Significant Financial
Interests could affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research activities funded by PHS, or proposed for
such funding, and determine what conditions or restrictions, if any, should be imposed by the institution to manage
such interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Public disclosure of significant financial interests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Monitoring of research by independent reviewers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Modification of the research plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disqualification from participation in all or a portion of the research funded by the PHS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Divestiture of significant financial interests; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each Institution that applies for research funding from the PHS must include in its policy for the identification
and management of Significant Financial Interest procedures for enforcement action against employees who do not
comply with the Institution's policy. If the failure of an employee to comply with the policy of the Institution has
biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the PHS
Awarding Component of the corrective action taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the situation and, as
necessary, take appropriate action, or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include
directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the funded project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The HHS may inquire into the Institutional procedures and actions regarding financial interests in PHS-funded
research, including the disposition of a particular financial interest. Such inquiry may be initiated based on information
obtained by the HHS under this subpart, from an award-related document (application, progress report, publication
of results), or any other source. Based on a specific inquiry, the HHS may decide that a particular Significant Financial
Interest of the type described in &sect;50.606 will bias the objectivity of the PHS-funded research to such an extent
that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed a Significant Financial Interest
described in &sect;50.606 in accordance with this subpart. The PHS may determine that suspension of funding is necessary
until the matter is resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In any case in which the Department determines that a PHS-funded project of clinical research whose purpose is
to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed, conducted, or reported
by an Investigator with a Significant Financial Interest that was not disclosed or managed as required by this subpart,
the Institution must require disclosure of the financial interest in each public presentation of the results of the
research.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (RRA), as amended, requires landholders (landowners and lessees) to meet certain
requirements in order to be eligible to receive irrigation water from Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) projects.
The purposes of the proposed rule are to improve compliance with the form submittal requirements of the RRA and the
Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations (43 CFR Part 426), help ensure that irrigation water is delivered only to
eligible landholders, and recoup administrative costs Reclamation incurs in conjunction with noncompliance with
these requirements. The proposed rule revises the existing rules by adding a section that will impose fees on districts
when statutory and regulatory requirements concerning the submittal of forms are not met.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The RRA limits the amount of owned land on which a landholder can receive irrigation water and places a limit on the amount
of leased land that can receive such water at a subsidized water rate. In order to ensure compliance with the ownership
limitations and the limitations on subsidies, certain statutory and regulatory requirements must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of these requirements applies to all landholders whose landholdings in districts subject to the acreage limitation
provisions total more than 40 acres. These landholders must complete RRA certification or reporting forms prior
to receipt of irrigation water. The forms must be completed annually and submitted to each district in which the landholder
receives irrigation water. Landholders must disclose on the forms all the land they own and lease directly or indirectly
in Reclamation projects that are subject to the acreage limitation provisions. The forms must be resubmitted whenever
a landholding change occurs. If a landholding does not change, a verification statement to that effect must be submitted
each year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the RRA and 43 CFR Part 426 set limits on the receipt of irrigation water and establish requirements that must
be met in order to receive such water, the current rules do not address situations in which water has been delivered
to landholders who failed to meet all the requirements. These situations were not addressed because the RRA does not
contemplate such deliveries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Districts, rather than Reclamation, generally control the deliveries of irrigation water to landholders. Pursuant
to their contracts with the United States, the districts are legally obligated not to deliver irrigation water to
landholders who do not meet the eligibility requirements in the RRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the form requirements discussed previously, 43 CFR 426.10(k) specifically states that failure by
landholders to submit the required certification or reporting form(s) will result in loss of eligibility to receive
irrigation water. However, during its water district reviews, Reclamation has found that in some instances, districts
have delivered irrigation water to landholders who had failed to meet the form requirements and other requirements
of the law and rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, Reclamation adopted a compensation policy whereby full-cost charges were assessed for irrigation water
that had been delivered to ineligible landholders. This policy is based on the legal theory that when irrigation water
is delivered to ineligible recipients, it is an unlawful conversion of the Government's property interest in the
water, and the Government is therefore entitled to be compensated for the conversion. Since Reclamation cannot recover
the water that was delivered to the ineligible recipients, it has been Reclamation's position that it is entitled
to recover the value of its property interest in that water and that the full-cost water rate prescribed in the RRA is
an appropriate measure of the water's value.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the new administration came into office in 1993, Reclamation decided to review certain agency policies, one
of which was the full-cost compensation policy for RRA form violations. The Commissioner of Reclamation asked the
Department of the Interior's Office of the Solicitor whether Reclamation is permitted to impose charges other than
full-cost compensation charges for such violations. In a July 23, 1993, memorandum, the Associate Solicitor, Division
of Energy and Resources, advised the Commissioner that several laws ``*&blank;*&blank;* authorize Reclamation
to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out its mission, including those which would assess fees. This means
that Reclamation may, by regulation, impose administrative fees or other charges designed to recover the costs it
incurs for processing improperly submitted forms or for collecting forms from those who have not submitted them.''
The Associate Solicitor further concluded that ``*&blank;*&blank;* Reclamation has considerable discretion
in determining how to calculate those costs, so long as the charges imposed bear a demonstrable relationship to the
costs incurred by the agency and have the intended effect of improving compliance with the Act and achieving congressional
objectives.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Associate Solicitor's conclusions, Reclamation decided to consider the imposition of assessments
to recover its administrative costs. Under this approach, an assessment would be established based on the costs incurred
by Reclamation for additional actions the agency must take to correct instances of noncompliance. An average cost
per violation would be determined and applied uniformly throughout Reclamation projects. The assessments would
provide an equitable method for addressing RRA violations and result in charges that are reasonable, while recovering
the incremental costs Reclamation incurs. In addition, even though such assessments would be applied after a violation
had taken place, they would provide an incentive for landholders and districts to comply in upcoming water years.
Thereby, the assessments would help to ensure that ineligible landholders do not receive irrigation water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the concept of assessments for administrative costs, Reclamation decided to revise the current
rules to provide for such assessments. However, before initiating the rulemaking, Reclamation notified the public
of its intent and asked for their comments. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period, 32 responses were received. Most responses were submitted by district personnel or attorneys
representing districts or other water user organizations; some individual landholders also submitted comments.
Approximately 50 percent of the respondents approved of Reclamation's intent to establish the proposed assessments.
The remaining 50 percent were either opposed to the concept or did not express a strong position on the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most frequently expressed comment was that the assessments should not be based on the full-cost water rate as that
term is defined in the RRA. Many respondents gave suggestions for establishing the proposed assessments; they are
summarized in the following list.

In addition to the above comments, some respondents questioned Reclamation's authority to impose assessments for
administrative costs. A few respondents also questioned whether the assessments will have the intended effect of
improving compliance with the requirements of the RRA. One respondent commented that Reclamation should not use
the assessments to replace the current requirement that landholders must submit an RRA form as a condition for receipt
of irrigation water. Another stated that RRA compliance levels would improve if Reclamation conducted water district
reviews and district training sessions more frequently. Two respondents requested Reclamation to increase the
40-acre threshold for exemption from the RRA form requirements, while another requested that the current class 1
equivalency provisions be revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reclamation received several suggestions for establishing the amount of the assessments. Two respondents thought
the assessment should be $100 for instances where RRA forms contain minor errors. One suggested that in cases where
form errors are more significant; for example, failure to disclose land held in excess of a non-full-cost entitlement,
the full-cost rate plus a $2,000 fee should be charged. Another suggestion was that Reclamation should ask Congress
to pass legislation authorizing the agency to charge twice the full-cost rate if irrigation water is delivered to
excess land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments were considered during preparation of the proposed rule except for those relating to the forms exemption
threshold, equivalency provisions, deliveries to excess land, water district reviews, and RRA training. These
topics are outside the scope of the subject rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides for the imposition of assessments for administrative costs incurred by Reclamation in
conjunction with noncompliance with the form requirements. A district will be assessed for administrative costs
when RRA forms are not submitted prior to receipt of irrigation water. The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis
in each district for each direct and indirect landholder that failed to comply with the form requirements. A district
will also be assessed for administrative costs when corrections to RRA forms are not provided within a 45-day grace
period. The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis in each district for each direct and indirect landholder for
which corrected forms are not provided within the grace period. These assessments for administrative costs will
replace the full-cost charges that Reclamation currently assesses for form violations pursuant to its compensation
policy. The administrative cost assessments will not be subject to the underpayment interest component as set forth
in &sect;426.23. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment for administrative costs is initially set at $260 per form violation. The amount is based on a review
of the costs Reclamation incurred in 1991, 1992, and 1993 performing activities to address RRA form violations. The
assessment reflects the average direct and indirect costs incurred Reclamation-wide for: (1) communicating with
district representatives or landholders to obtain missing or corrected forms, (2) assisting landholders in completing
certification or reporting forms for the period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they were not in compliance with the form requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) performing onsite visits to determine if irrigation water deliveries have been terminated to landholders that
failed to submit the required forms, and (4) performing other activities necessary to address form violations. The
assessment will be reviewed at least once every 5 years and, if needed, will be adjusted to reflect new cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with other assessments, districts will be held responsible for payment of the assessments because of their contractual
obligation with the United States. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3302, charges collected through the imposition of assessments
for administrative costs will be credited to the general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payment of the assessments set forth in the proposed rule does not exempt districts and landholders from the form requirements
of the RRA or Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations. Districts are not permitted to continue water deliveries
to ineligible recipients simply because they are willing to pay the assessments. Reclamation will take all necessary
actions to prevent the delivery of irrigation water to ineligible land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rule does not constitute a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866 because it will not: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in the executive order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment for administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment for administrative costs shall initially be set at $260. This is based on an average of the direct and
indirect costs the Bureau of Reclamation incurs performing activities to obtain certification or reporting forms
from landholders that failed to submit such forms prior to receipt of irrigation water and form corrections that are
not submitted by the designated due date. This initial $260 assessment for administrative costs will be reviewed
at least once every 5 years and adjusted, if needed, to reflect new cost data based upon the Bureau's costs for communicating
with district representatives and landholders to obtain missing or corrected forms; assisting landholders in completing
certification or reporting forms for the period of time they were not in compliance with the form requirements; performing
onsite visits to determine if irrigation water deliveries have been terminated to landholders that failed to submit
the required forms; and performing other activities necessary to address form violations. Notice of the revised
assessment for administrative costs will be published in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to amend the regulations pertaining to precontract costs to specify the content of letters to contractors
which authorize the incurrence of precontract costs, make clear the circumstances when precontract costs would
be appropriate, and clarify that precontract costs are not allowable unless the clause ``Precontract Costs'' is
included in the contract. In addition, the proposed rule revises the prescription for the clause to allow its use in
other than cost-reimbursement contracts. Also, the rule proposes to change the title of that clause from ``Date of
Incurrence of Costs'' to ``Precontract Costs'' to more accurately reflect its purpose.

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although NASA has used authorization letters for precontract costs for many years, there has been little standardization
in the contents of the letters. In addition, the current NASA FAR Supplement coverage at 1831.205&hyph;32 does not
make it clear when the use of precontract costs would be appropriate, or that the clause at 1852.231&hyph;70 is required
to be in the contract in order for precontract costs to be allowable. In addition, the clause prescription incorrectly
states that the clause only should go in cost-reimbursement contracts. The clause would also be applicable to fixed-price
incentive or redeterminable contracts and to terminated firm-fixed price contracts, as the cost principles at (FAR)
48 CFR Subpart 31.2 would be applicable. The proposed rule specifies the information to be included in precontract
cost authorization letters to contractors, identifies when the use of precontract costs would be appropriate, as
well as requires the clause at 1852.231&hyph;70 be used for precontract costs to be allowable. The proposed rule also
retitles the clause at 1852.231&hyph;70 from the ``Date of Incurrence of Costs'' to ``Precontract Costs'' to more
accurately reflect the purpose of the clause.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As part of its comprehensive efforts to address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem of light vehicle rollover, this agency is proposing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new consumer information regulation that would require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger cars and light multipurpose passenger vehicles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trucks be labeled with information about their resistance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rollover. This information would enable prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasers to make choices about new vehicles based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences in rollover risk; motivate manufacturers to give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more priority to rollover stability in designing their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles; and inform motorists that they can reduce the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of injury in a rollover by wearing their safety belts. NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that this would reduce the number of injuries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities from rollover accidents.

I. The Rollover Crash Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rollover crashes occur for many reasons, and involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of a variety of factors including the driver, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roadway, the vehicle, and environmental conditions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship of these various factors to rollover crashes can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be examined by analyzing data from various sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency estimates that there were 220,000 rollover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crashes involving passenger cars, and multipurpose passenger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles and trucks under 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross vehicle weight rating (collectively, ``light trucks'') in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. These resulted in 9,186 fatalities; 56,000 occupants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these vehicles received serious, incapacitating injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These numbers have remained relatively constant over the past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six years. Ejections are responsible for 63 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities. Safety belts are used by only 13 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatally injured occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 220,000 rollover crashes, 207,000, or 94 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were single vehicle crashes and 192,000 of these, or 93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, occurred off the road. Various accident studies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that loss of vehicle directional control is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prelude to rollover in 50 percent to 80 percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rollover crashes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the years 1985&hyph;1991, small cars had the greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of rollover fatalities, followed by standard-size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pickup trucks. However, pickup trucks and sport utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles have fatality rates per million registered vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between two and three times as great as that of passenger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cars. The difference between the numbers of rollover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities and the rollover fatality rates for particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle types is a result of the relative proportions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various types of vehicles in the fleet. There are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many more small cars than pickup trucks and sport utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles on the road today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A more extensive discussion of rollover statistics, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sources for this information, can be found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper,'' NHTSA 1994, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Agency Efforts To Address the Rollover Crash Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that no single type of rulemaking or other agency action could solve all, or even a majority of,
the problems associated with rollover. Accordingly, it is pursuing a broad range of actions to address those problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, NHTSA has published an NPRM to reduce the potential for injuries to the head from contact with upper interior
components (58 FR 7506, February 8, 1993). The comment period was reopened to December 1, 1993 (58 FR 54099, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 20, 1993) and a public hearing was held on November 15, 1993. As explained in the Addendum to Technical Assessment
Paper, NHTSA's research indicates that head injuries are the most prevalent type of injury associated with rollovers.
The agency expects to issue a final rule on this subject in late 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, with respect to anti-lock brake systems, the agency has published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) for light duty vehicles (January 4, 1994, 59 FR 281). (``Light duty vehicles'' include cars, vans, pickup
trucks and sport utility vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) or less.) Since most vehicles involved in rollovers lose their longitudinal stability
before leaving the roadway, where they then trip and roll over, and since anti-lock brake systems are designed to enhance
the longitudinal stability of a vehicle, a requirement for anti- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lock brakes could reduce the number of rollovers. NHTSA's preliminary evaluation of rear-wheel anti-lock brake
systems, the type of anti-lock brakes most often found on light trucks, indicates that anti-lock brakes on light trucks
are effective in reducing the number of nonfatal single vehicle accident rollovers for almost every type of truck,
under any type of road condition. Reductions of single vehicle accident rollovers were typically in the range of 30
percent to 40 percent. NHTSA is continuing to analyze the data and a comprehensive report of the findings will be published
at a later date. (The preliminary evaluation is available in Docket No. 70&hyph;27&hyph;GR&hyph;026.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, as noted above, ejections are a frequent occurrence in fatal rollover crashes. To attempt to reduce the frequency
of ejections, the agency is conducting research on glass/plastic side windows and improved door latches. Preliminary
research results should be available within the next year to enable NHTSA to determine if rulemaking should be pursued
in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the agency is conducting research on improvements to vehicles' roof strength that could reduce head and neck
injuries. A decision whether to begin rulemaking on this subject is expected in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, as noted above, safety belt use is very low among persons fatally or seriously injured in rollover crashes.
NHTSA promotes increased use of safety belts through public awareness and education efforts and by supporting the
implementation and enforcement of state safety belt use laws. Agency occupant protection awareness and education
activities include national media campaigns; outreach through national health, medical, civic, and intergovernmental
organizations; and, administration of Section 402 state highway safety program funds. The agency promotes effective
state safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belt usage laws by conducting evaluation studies and demonstration projects, training law enforcement personnel,
and by administering the Section 153 state incentive grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NHTSA has contracted with the Advertising Council to prepare two ``Vince and Larry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
SM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (the agency's safety belt ``spokespersons'') public service announcements (PSAs) for television, and one ``Vince
and Larry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
SM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' PSA for radio, on the specific benefits of safety belts in rollover crashes. One of the television PSAs and the radio
PSA were available at the end of March, 1994. The other television PSA will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available approximately six months later. These safety belt initiatives will supplement the other actions to address
the rollover problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixth, it is well known that rollover crashes have a high incidence of alcohol involvement. The agency has numerous
programs and activities aimed at reducing alcohol-related crashes, injuries, and fatalities, which follow two

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fundamental strategies: information-education (such as Advertising Council PSAs on television) and laws-enforcement-sanctions
(such as .08 BAC, sobriety checkpoints, and increasingly severe sanctions for repeat offenders). Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
410 grants to states provide incentives to states to use these strategies. These combined strategies have been effective
as alcohol-related fatalities have decreased 30 percent over the past 10 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventh, and finally, the agency is issuing this notice regarding vehicle stability requirements and consumer information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Consumer Information Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that consumer and manufacturer behavior can be affected through the provision of consumer information
regarding vehicle safety. The agency's experience with the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) demonstrates the power
of consumer information. Under the NCAP Program, the agency tests the ability of vehicles to protect their front seat
occupants in frontal crash tests. The tests are similar to those conducted under Standard No. 208, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupant Protection,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to determine whether vehicles meet the Standard's injury criteria, except that the Standard's tests are conducted
at 30 mph, while NCAP tests are conducted at 35 mph. Several manufacturers have informed the agency that they view it
as important to perform well in the NCAP tests, even though there is no regulatory requirement to do so. The decline
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury scores in NCAP tests over time for all manufacturers, as reported in ``Report on the Historical Performance
of Different Auto Manufacturers in the New Car Assessment Program Tests,'' NHTSA, August 1993, can also be attributed
partially to NCAP.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that further safety improvements could be gained through providing consumers with information
about additional aspects of new vehicle safety performance. NHTSA recently conducted a series of 15 focus groups,
comprised of members of the public, to examine the type and format of desired consumer information about vehicle safety.
(See ``Focus Groups on Traffic Safety Issues: Public Response to NCAP,'' S.W. Morris &amp; Company, Inc., August
1993, which can be found in Docket No. 79&hyph;17, Notice 01, or ``New Car 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment Program_Response to the NCAP FY 1992 Congressional Requirements,'' Report to the Congress, December
1993, which can be found in Docket No. 97&hyph;17, Notice 39). One of the topics examined was the current NCAP and how
it could be improved. In response to the results of the focus group work, the agency has changed the format for NCAP test
results. The new format responds to consumer demand for reporting results in a way that is less technical and easier
to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus groups also indicated that the agency's consumer safety information activities should be expanded to include
additional kinds of crashes, including side impacts and rollovers. The potential importance of providing broader
safety information about new light duty vehicle performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be seen from figures regarding the proportion of fatalities in each of the three most important types of crashes.
In 1991, frontal crashes accounted for 39 percent of all fatalities involving light duty vehicle occupants, rollover
crashes for 30 percent, and side impact crashes for 25 percent. Together, these three types of crashes account for
94 percent of all fatalities. Information on performance in all three types of crashes could provide consumers with
a comprehensive, balanced picture of the safety of new vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its efforts to expand its consumer safety information programs, NHTSA has sought participation and guidance
from the general public on the types and format of safety information to be provided to consumers. On January 3, 1994,
the agency published a request for comments on whether to supplement the agency's efforts by holding a public meeting
to discuss, among other items, the expansion of the NCAP program to other crash modes (59 FR 104). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the agency plans to supplement this rollover proposal with a future proposal for requiring
that each new vehicle have a window sticker providing information not only on vehicle rollover resistance, but also
on frontal and side impact crash performance.

A. Statutory Requirement for Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (the Act) (part of the Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) requires
the agency to address several vehicle safety subjects through rulemaking. One of the subjects, set forth in section
2503(1), is protection against unreasonable risk of rollovers of passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles,
and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds
or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2502(b)(2)(A) of the Act required that NHTSA publish, no later than May 31, 1992, an ANPRM or a notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) on this subject. The January 3, 1992, ANPRM fulfilled this mandate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides that the agency must complete a rulemaking action on rollover within
26 months of publishing the ANPRM. The ANPRM was published on January 3, 1992; thus, this rulemaking action was to have
been completed by March 3, 1994. Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that this rulemaking will be considered
completed when NHTSA either publishes a final rule or decides and announces that it is not promulgating a rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA announced in its January 3, 1992 ANPRM on the rollover problem that it was considering various regulatory actions
to reduce the frequency of vehicle rollovers and/or the number and severity of injuries resulting from vehicle rollovers
(57 FR 242). The agency requested comments on potential regulatory actions in the areas of: (1) Improved stability;
(2) improved crashworthiness; and (3) consumer information. NHTSA said that it might issue a rule or rules in any one
of these three categories, or in any combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ANPRM discussed the agency's statistical analyses of the interaction of driver characteristics, vehicle stability
metrics, roadway and environmental conditions. The notice described the following vehicle stability metrics as
having a potentially significant role in vehicle rollover: center of gravity height; static stability factor; tilt
table ratio; side pull ratio; wheelbase; critical sliding velocity; rollover prevention metric; braking stability
metric; and percent of total vehicle weight on the rear axle. A vehicle stability metric is a measured vehicle parameter
that presumably is related to the vehicle's likelihood of rollover involvement. To supplement the ANPRM, a Technical
Assessment Paper that discussed testing activities, testing results, accident data collection, and analysis of
the data was placed in the docket on January 6, 1992. A description of the individual metrics can be found in the Technical
Assessment Paper.

 For the remainder of this notice, ``tilt table angle'' is used in place of ``tilt table ratio,'' regardless of the term
used in any other document. NHTSA is using ``tilt table angle'' because the agency is proposing tilt table angle as
one of the possible measurements to be used in the proposed consumer information regulation. Tilt table angle is the
angle at which the last uphill tire of a vehicle lifts off a tilting platform. Tilt table ratio is the tangent of the tilt
table angle and is believed to be harder for the average consumer to understand.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the development of the ANPRM and subsequent to receiving and analyzing comments to the ANPRM, it became obvious
that no single type of rulemaking could solve all, or even a majority of, the problems associated with rollover. This
view was strengthened by the agency's review and analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the comments on the ANPRM. To emphasize this conclusion and inform the public further about the complicated nature
of the light duty vehicle rollover problem, the agency released a document titled ``Planning Document for Rollover
Prevention and Injury Mitigation'' at a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting on rollover on September 23, 1992.
The Planning Document gave an overview of the rollover problem and a list of alternative actions that NHTSA was examining
to address the problem. Alternatives for regulatory action and a schedule for decisions on each were included. The
current status of the presented alternative actions was discussed earlier in this notice. The document was placed
in Docket No. 91&hyph;68; Notice 02, on the same day. NHTSA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-two comments concerning the ANPRM and the Planning Document were received. A Summary of Comments was placed
in the docket on September 15, 1993. Ten commenters addressed the Planning Document, eight of whom had also commented
on the ANPRM. Responses to the Planning Document, for the most part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were abridged forms of the commenters' responses to the ANPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the commenting vehicle manufacturers asserted that, while stability metrics are statistically related to the
rates with which single vehicle accidents result in rollovers, they are not causally related to rollover. Therefore,
the manufacturers asserted, the agency cannot issue a regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on any one of these metrics solely because of its statistical correlation with accident data. Automotive Testing,
BMW, Ford, GM, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA, then known as the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association), and VW claimed that stability metrics are insufficient by themselves to explain a vehicle's degree
of involvement in rollover crashes. These commenters stated that driver and environmental factors outweigh the
contributions of vehicle factors to the likelihood of a single vehicle accident becoming a rollover. Nevertheless,
most commenters addressed the relevancy of several of the individual metrics the agency considered for a vehicle
stability rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tilt table angle, one of the metrics being proposed in this notice, appeared to be more acceptable to the commenters
than the other stability metrics. While side pull ratio was favored by Automotive Testing, Chrysler, GM, and Nissan,
all these commenters also commented favorably on aspects of tilt table angle. Static stability factor was favored
by only Perrone Forensic Consulting, who also commented favorably on tilt table angle. All other commenters who indicated
a preference among the metrics discussed in the ANPRM favored tilt table angle. However, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Isuzu,
and VW claim vehicle changes made to improve a vehicle's tilt table performance may degrade a vehicle's control and
handling attributes. Chrysler said that the repeatability of results from the tilt table procedure was unknown.
On the other hand, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the International 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, and GM stated they believe that the procedure is repeatable. Chrysler
and AAMA also commented that the tilt table test is not a standard practice and its measurement error has not been established.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters did not respond directly to the idea of using critical sliding velocity, which is also being proposed for
use in this notice. However, most manufacturers commented that center of gravity height (a measurement necessary
to calculate critical sliding velocity) is difficult to measure and that the measurement is not repeatable. Therefore,
according to these commenters, any metric which uses center of gravity height would be impracticable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also focussed on crashworthiness improvements. By far the most favorable crashworthiness countermeasure
cited by the commenters was increased seat belt use to prevent ejections. In general, commenters believe that more
benefits could be gained through increased seat belt use than through any vehicle related crashworthiness or crash
avoidance countermeasure. Some commenters also favored improved roof structures including roll bars or cages,
but Ford, GM, Nissan, and VW believe the installation of a roll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bar or cage raises the vehicle's center of gravity and decreases rollover stability. Other suggestions were for improved
glazing, improved latch/lock/hinge systems for doors, anti-lock brakes, bumper height regulations, removal of
drunk and otherwise impaired drivers from the road, stricter enforcement of speed limits, and improved public awareness
of the causes of rollover crashes as ways to reduce rollover casualties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Chrysler, GM, AAMA, and Toyota claimed that labeling vehicles with a stability metric would be simplistic
and could mislead consumers, giving them a false sense of security in a vehicle labeled with a high stability metric
(i.e., a metric indicating comparatively high resistance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rollover). These commenters believe that consumers could consider the metric to be an absolute measure of rollover
likelihood, regardless of driver behavior or roadway conditions.

IV. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Summary of Agency Decision Not To Propose a Vehicle Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In analyzing whether to proceed with a vehicle stability rulemaking, the agency identified several criteria that
had to be met before proposing a safety standard. First, the identified vehicle metrics had to have a causal relationship
to the likelihood of rollover. For example, center of gravity height affects rollover likelihood; the color of the
vehicle does not. Second, the metric had to have a statistical relationship to rollover frequency. Third, improvement
in the metric should result in significant safety benefits at a reasonable cost without having the effect of necessitating
the radical redesigning of one or more types of vehicles. As discussed below, the agency identified two metrics that
met the first two criteria, but not the third. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether it was appropriate to propose a new vehicle safety standard, NHTSA examined the complex interactions
between driver behavior, vehicle properties, and roadway characteristics which result in rollovers. The suitability
of a vehicle safety standard based on rollover stability depends on the importance of rollover stability, as represented
by a vehicle metric, relative to other rollover influences, such as vehicle handling properties, vehicle condition,
the nature of the roadway and shoulder terrain, and driver behavior. The agency sought to determine whether vehicle
stability metrics are significant variables in a statistical model of the risk of rollover. If they are, then a standard
regulating stability might be justified, depending on the results of a comparison of benefits and costs for such a
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After analyzing a number of static and dynamic rollover metrics, the agency concluded that two vehicle metrics, tilt
table angle and critical sliding velocity, can account for about 50 percent of the variability in rollover risk in
single vehicle accidents, after considering driver, roadway, and environmental factors. (Rollover risk is the
number of single vehicle rollovers involving a particular make/model divided by the number of single vehicle crashes
of all types involving the same make/model.) This statistical analysis was conducted on all light duty vehicles treated
as a group. However, analysis of accident data indicated that certain subgroups of light duty vehicles are more likely
to roll over than other subgroups. For example, sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks tend to be the most
likely vehicles to roll over. Large passenger cars tend to be the least likely to roll over. The importance of this difference
is that if significant benefits are to be achieved, then changes in the metric should be made that affect passenger
cars since nearly 60 percent of rollover fatalities occur in those vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's analysis showed that setting a performance level high enough to affect passenger cars, would require
redesign of nearly all sport utility vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks. Using a single value of one of these metrics
as the performance standard for all light duty vehicles would have resulted in the radical redesign of the characteristics
many, and in some cases all, vehicles of certain classes. That degree of redesign would have raised issues of public
acceptance and possibly even the elimination of certain classes of vehicles as they are known today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid this consequence, the agency then examined whether several values for these metrics, each applying to a different
class of vehicles (e.g., one value for passenger cars and a different value for light trucks) would be feasible. Since
the statistical analyses discussed above were conducted on all light duty vehicles treated as a group, it was necessary
to determine whether either of the stability metrics exhibited sufficiently high levels of correlation to assure
the agency that a requirement applying to only one class of vehicle would be expected to reduce the incidence of rollovers
for vehicles in that class. As explained later in this notice, the agency found that the statistical correlations
of the metrics with rollover accident data within a class of vehicles was not so consistent as for all vehicles grouped
together. This weakening of the predictive ability of the metric is, to some extent, the result of the smaller range
of the metric within any class of vehicles together with the inherent variability in the data. Based on this analysis,
and the general analysis of costs and benefits discussed later, the agency determined that proposing a standard specifying
one minimum stability value for cars and others for various classes of light trucks could not be justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also determined that, considering the costs and benefits involved, proposing a safety standard specifying
a single minimum stability value for both cars and light trucks could not be justified. While light trucks have lower
stability measurements than cars do, the greatest number of rollover-related deaths and injuries occur in passenger
cars because of their larger population size. Therefore, if the agency wished to set a stability minimum high enough
to realize significant reductions in the number of fatalities in all light duty vehicles, it would have to set the minimum
above the stability number of most light trucks. The costs of such a standard, in terms of the cost of vehicle redesign
and the loss of consumer-desired attributes, were determined to be very high, as entire classes of light trucks would
probably need to be substantially redesigned to meet such a standard. This redesign could result in the elimination
of some vehicle types, e.g., sport utility vehicles, as they are known today.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on this analysis, NHTSA has decided not to propose a vehicle stability rule, and is deferring any further action
on this subject until such time as information becomes available demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such a rule.
The agency may reinitiate such a rulemaking upon receipt of such information. This termination of rulemaking on vehicle
stability fulfills the statutory mandate of section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i). However, through the consumer information
proposal being published today, and the other actions mentioned above, NHTSA is continuing to take a comprehensive
approach to reducing rollover casualties.

B. Summary of Proposed Consumer Information Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While NHTSA is terminating rulemaking on a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA believes that the correlation between
stability and rollover risk is significant enough to justify proposing a consumer information regulation to relieve
the possibility of uninformed risk. The agency believes that informing consumers of the relative resistance of different
vehicles to rollover will influence consumers to purchase more stable vehicles and encourage manufacturers to improve
the stability of their vehicles. The agency believes that these results are possible based on its assessment of how
consumers and manufacturers reacted to the provision of frontal crashworthiness information through the New Car
Assessment Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consumer information regulation being proposed by the agency would require manufacturers of passenger cars
and light trucks to label their vehicles with information relating to rollover stability. To that end, manufacturers
would be required to report a stability metric for each vehicle make/model to NHTSA by January 1 of each year. Manufacturers
would decide how to group vehicle make/models for the purpose of reporting stability metrics for those groups. To
ensure that the information is neither understated nor overstated, the reported stability metric would be measured
with a specified procedure and an accuracy tolerance on reported data would be required. NHTSA would use the information
reported by manufacturers to provide the manufacturers with the ranges of metrics for both passenger cars and light
trucks by April 1 of each year. For comparison purposes, these ranges would be included on vehicle labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New vehicles manufactured after September 1, 1996 would be required to have a prescribed window label listing the
metric of the labeled vehicle, the range of that metric for cars and the range for light trucks. In addition, prescribed
language on the label would explain the significance of the metric, warn consumers that all vehicles can and do roll
over, and remind consumers to always wear seat belts. The proposed regulation would also require manufacturers to
include the information on the vehicle label in the vehicle's owner's manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests comment on whether or not the proposed vehicle label should be a permanent sticker, in addition
to the window label which would be removed after first sale. If a commenter believes the label should be permanent,
NHTSA requests comment on whether the permanent sticker should be required on all vehicles, or only some subset of
vehicles with lower rollover stability. Finally, NHTSA requests suggestions on placement and size of a permanent
sticker. A permanent sticker would be useful to purchasers of used vehicles and drivers of rental vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is considering two metrics for providing information regarding rollover stability: critical sliding velocity
and tilt table angle. Critical sliding velocity is a measure of the minimum lateral (sideways) vehicle velocity required
to initiate rollover when the vehicle is tripped by something in the roadway environment, e.g., a curb. Tilt table
angle is the angle at which the last uphill tire of the vehicle lifts off a platform as the platform is increasingly tilted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is proposing two different options for specifying stability information using these metrics. First, NHTSA
may select one of the two metrics to appear on the label. For example, if the agency selected tilt table angle, it would
require that the specific angle for each vehicle be shown on its label. Second, NHTSA may require the label to include
a nonquantitative statement concerning the vehicle's rollover resistance based on one or both of the metrics. For
example, instead of stating a specific angle, the label might use symbols such as one, two, or three stars.

The agency has concluded that the two metrics with the best correlation to accident statistics are tilt table angle,
a static measurement, and critical sliding velocity, a metric calculated from static and dynamic vehicle measurements
and expressed as velocity, i.e., units of feet per second, miles per hour, or kilometers per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tilt table angle includes the influences of the vehicle's mass, center of gravity height, track width, and suspension
movement, all of which are physically related to rollover stability. Because it does not require an independent measurement
of center of gravity height, it is more practicable, less costly, and more repeatable than most static rollover metrics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical sliding velocity includes the roll moment of inertia as well as the various static factors mentioned above
in its calculation. The Technical Assessment Paper found critical sliding velocity alone to have less correlation
with rollover accident statistics than tilt table angle, but found it to be a statistically significant addition
to a model already containing tilt table angle. However, an error in the computation of critical sliding velocity
was made in the Technical Assessment Paper. When the logistic regression was repeated with the correct critical sliding
velocity values and data for more vehicle make/models and additional accident years, NHTSA found the correlation
of critical sliding velocity to accident statistics for all light duty vehicles grouped together and for the light
truck and passenger car categories to be better than that for tilt table angle. The Addendum to Technical Assessment
Paper contains the corrected analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the ANPRM, new vehicles have been added to the data base and their metrics measured. Several make/models have
been tested in different configurations to determine the range of metrics within a make/model, given the different
available original equipment options. Also included are several make/models of trucks and vans with anti-lock brakes
as standard equipment and several make/models of high sales volume passenger cars equipped with anti-lock brakes.
A complete list of all vehicles measured to date, their tilt table angles and critical sliding velocities, and the
ratio of the number of rollovers involving a particular vehicle model to the number of single vehicle accidents involving
the same model (RO/SVA) in Michigan from 1986 through 1990 can be found in Docket 91&hyph;68, Notice 2.

2. Predictive Power of the Metrics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency performed two types of analyses attempting to separate the influence of driver characteristics, road,
and environmental variables in the accident data so that the effect of vehicle rollover stability could be isolated.
A logistic regression analysis individually considered every accident in a very large data base. Make/models represented
in a great number of accidents influenced the results more than make/models with fewer accidents. A linear regression
analysis was also done on the rollover risk of make/models, adjusted for differences in driver and road characteristics
within their individual accident data bases, but not weighted by differences in accident numbers. The two analyses
are discussed in detail in the Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These analyses were conducted using three statistical models: (a) A model containing only driver, roadway, and environmental
characteristics; (b) a model containing driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics, and critical sliding
velocity; and (c) a model containing driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics, and tilt table angle.
For the purposes of comparison, the analyses were limited to accidents involving those make/models for which the
agency had both tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity data. This results in an equal number of accidents,
or observations (88,397), in each statistical model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The logistic regression predicts whether a single vehicle accident will be a rollover based on the factors in a particular
model. Then the predicted outcomes of the individual accidents are compiled to predict a rollover risk (rollovers
per single vehicle accident) for each of the 128 make/models for which the agency has data on both metrics. This predicted
risk is then compared to the actual risk known from accident data on these make/models. Two numbers are presented in
the table below for each of the statistical models. The first is the percent variability explained by the comparison
of the rollover risk predicted by the logistic regression model and the actual rollover risk. The second number is
the percentage of the variability unexplained by the model containing only driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics
which is explained by the addition of either tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity. For example, the driver/road/environmental
model leaves 77 percent of the variability in the data unexplained; 23 percent is explained. When tilt table angle
was added to the model to represent vehicle stability, 65 percent of the variability in rollover risk was explained.
The difference between the 77 percent unexplained variability in the driver/road variable model and the 35 percent
unexplained variability of the driver/road variable plus tilt table angle model is 42 percent, which is 55 percent
of the unexplained variability in the driver/road variable model (42 percent/77 percent). Slightly more than half
of the variability unaccounted for by driver and road characteristics was explained by the addition of tilt table
angle. Thus, the logistic regression analysis indicates that stability, as measured by tilt table angle, is an important
predictor of the likelihood of a single vehicle accident becoming a rollover. Substitution of critical sliding velocity
produced similar results. A complete discussion of the results of these analyses can be found in the Addendum to Technical
Assessment Paper in the docket.

The linear regression analysis also demonstrates the predictive power of tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity.
This analysis showed that tilt table angle accounts for about 53 percent of the variability in rollover risk remaining
after adjustment for differences in driver and road characteristics. The analysis showed that critical sliding
velocity accounts for about 66 percent of the variability in rollover risk remaining after adjustments for driver
and road characteristics. These compare to the 55 percent and 68 percent values found by logistic regression. These
figures demonstrate that the two analytic methods are essentially in agreement regarding the statistical significance
of stability metrics to the prediction of rollover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of both the logistic and linear regression analyses performed by the agency suggest that a vehicle stability
metric alone can account for approximately 50 percent of the variability in rollover risk in single vehicle accidents,
for the population of make/models studied. While ideally it would be desirable to have these variables explain 100
percent of the remaining variability, such statistical correlations are almost never achieved. The agency views
these analyses as demonstrating sound statistical and causal relationships between these variables and the likelihood
of rollover. At the same time, the analyses show that other factors in addition to those analyzed are affecting rollover
risk, as 35 percent to 25 percent of the variability in rollover risk is still unexplained after accounting for the
driver, roadway, and tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above analyses used a Michigan accident data base combining passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility
vehicles. As explained in section I, the rate of rollover fatalities and injuries per million registered vehicles
is higher for sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks, but the absolute majority of harm occurs in passenger
cars, because of their large numbers in use. In the current vehicle fleet, passenger cars generally have higher measured
stability than light trucks. Thus, a safety standard requiring a minimum level of stability appropriate for all light
duty vehicles would not be expected to affect many present or future small cars and therefore would not result in significant
safety benefits. (For a further discussion of the problems associated with a minimum standard, see the section below
entitled, ``Estimate of the Costs of a Standard.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, the agency also examined the relative predictive capability of the stability metrics to rollover risk for
passenger cars and light trucks separately, to investigate the possibility of setting a higher minimum level of stability
for passenger cars. The results are shown in the table below, including a comparison to the results for all vehicles
considered as a single group (see Table 1). As with the analysis of all vehicles considered as a single group, these
analyses were limited to make/models for which both tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity were known.

These results show that, while a good proportion of the variability remaining in the driver/road/environmental
model is explained by either metric for the group containing all vehicles, when the vehicles are divided into classes,
the results are not consistent. The inconsistency seen in the model results by vehicle class is, to some extent, the
result of the smaller range of the metric within any subgroup of vehicles together with the inherent variability in
the data. These analyses and the analyses of benefits and costs discussed later, indicate that different minimum
standards for passenger cars and light trucks cannot be supported using either tilt table angle or critical sliding
velocity.

As discussed previously, NHTSA concluded that both of the vehicle metrics, tilt table angle and critical sliding
velocity, were statistically and causally related to the likelihood of rollover in a single vehicle crash. To determine
whether to propose a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA next compared the benefits and costs of such a standard. A detailed
discussion of the benefits analysis can be found in ``Potential Reductions in Fatalities and Injuries in Single Vehicle
Rollover Crashes as a Result of a Minimum Rollover Stability Standard,'' which has been placed in Docket No. 91&hyph;68,
Notice 03. A detailed discussion of the cost estimates can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation, which
has also been placed in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03.

A. Estimate of the Benefits of a Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency made two basic estimates of benefits of a minimum standard for rollover stability. One was based on the reductions
in RO/SVA predicted by the logistic regression model for increases in critical sliding velocity. The other was based
on reductions in RO/SVA predicted for increases in tilt table angle. All other factors being equal, it is reasonable
to expect an inverse relationship between rollover risk and either critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle.
Thus, the higher the lateral sliding velocity necessary to trip a vehicle, the less likely it is to roll over, and vice
versa. Similarly, the greater the angle necessary to tip a vehicle from the tilt table, the less likely it is to roll
over, and vice versa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To quantify the benefits of potential minimum standards for rollover stability, NHTSA examined the net prevention
of fatalities and serious injuries associated with various minimum levels of critical sliding velocity and tilt
table angle. Fatality and injury levels were estimated by using: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The reduction of the rollover risk predicted for increases in critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The number of single vehicle accidents per registered vehicle expected to occur; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The reduction in fatalities and/or injuries if a single vehicle accident does not result in a rollover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimate of the benefits of a minimum stability safety standard incorporated several simplifying assumptions.
First, the agency assumed that the severity of the accidents would be reduced but that the accidents would not be prevented.
Because single vehicle rollover accidents are more severe than single vehicle non-rollover accidents, prevention
of rollover reduces the number of serious injuries and fatalities. However, under this scenario, the total number
of single vehicle accidents is assumed to remain constant. This assumption is somewhat pessimistic, because an unknown
number of crashes would most likely be avoided. But the remaining assumptions used may tend to overestimate the benefits
since NHTSA also assumed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The numbers of rollover injuries and fatalities prevented would be proportional to the number of rollovers prevented,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The fatality and injury rates of the late 1980s for the make/models which would be affected by a minimum standard
will remain representative in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second assumption may overstate the benefits if increased safety belt use in the 1990s, as is the goal of NHTSA,
reduces the overall harm from rollover accidents. That is, as belt use increases, rollover casualties decrease,
even though the number of rollover crashes remains constant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. Rollover Risk Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To estimate the reduction in the rollover risk that would be obtained by changing a vehicle metric, the agency used
logistic regression to determine the sensitivity of rollover risk to changes in critical sliding velocity or tilt
table angle. The outcome of each accident of the subject make/model in the data base was re-evaluated individually
changing the stability metric but retaining the other vehicle, driver, and road characteristics present in the actual
crash. A new RO/SVA ratio was determined on the basis of the predicted outcome of each accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To examine the sensitivity of the model to a change in critical sliding velocity, the agency divided the range of critical
sliding velocities from 14.26 to 16.73 kilometers per hour (kph). The low end of this range is representative of vehicles
in NHTSA's database with the lowest critical sliding velocity. The high end of this range is representative of a critical
sliding velocity equivalent to the 1.20 value for static stability factor recommended in the Wirth petition (also
equivalent to a tilt table angle of 46.4 degrees). (A discussion of the Wirth petition can be found in the ANPRM, 57 FR
242, 244&hyph;45.) The highest value in the range is greater than the proposed European tilt table angle limit of 44.3
degrees, and in the agency's judgement represents the highest practicable standard. A standard at the upper limit
of the range would affect 1,648,000 vehicles manufactured in 1991, including 87 percent of compact sport utility
vehicles, 100 percent of standard vans, and 31 percent of compact pickups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency then divided this range into six even increments and calculated the RO/SVA for each increment for various
classes of vehicles. Each successively higher increment represents an increase in critical sliding velocity of
0.41 kph. The agency then predicted the decrease in single vehicle accident rollovers for each incremental increase
in critical sliding velocity. (See Table 3.)

As an example, for vehicles with a critical sliding velocity between 14.26 and 16.73 kph, an increase of 12 percent
in critical sliding velocity was predicted to decrease single vehicle accident rollovers of compact sport utility
vehicles by about 13 percent, standard sport utility vehicles by about 15 percent, compact pickups by about 15 percent,
and minivans by about 16 percent. There is only one standard van with a critical sliding velocity below 16.73 kph. Its
rollover risk is predicted to decrease 17 percent if its critical sliding velocity were to increase 12 percent. A 12
percent increase in critical sliding velocity represents a change of 1.65 kph, or four increments. A complete discussion
of these analyses can be found in the paper ``Potential Reductions in Fatalities and Injuries in Single Vehicle Crashes
as a Result of a Minimum Stability Standard'' in the docket.

A similar analysis was done using tilt table angle. For tilt table angle, each increment was approximately equivalent
to 0.75 degrees. For vehicles with a tilt table angle between 42 and 46.4 degrees (the equivalent of the critical sliding
velocity range), an increase of 11 percent (also four increments, or 3.00 degrees) in tilt table angle was predicted
to decrease single vehicle accident rollovers among compact sport utility vehicles by about 15 percent, standard
sport utility vehicles by about 19 percent, compact pickups by about 17 percent, minivans by about 20 percent, and
standard vans by about 22 percent. (See Table 4.)

2. Predicted Single Vehicle Accident Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To estimate the number of single vehicle accidents in a hypothetical future vehicle population, NHTSA assumed that
the future population would have the same proportion of vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles as the 1991 production,
and that the population would have the same proportion of high and low critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle
vehicles within these categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA then distributed the numbers of serious injuries by vehicle category (as tabulated by Data Link Inc., under
contract to NHTSA) among the 1991 example vehicles on the basis of relative production volume, relative single vehicle
accident involvement rate, and relative rollover risk per single vehicle accident. (The Data Link reports are available
in Docket 91&hyph;68, Notice 2.) Data Link reported injuries and fatalities by vehicle types: pickup truck, van,
sport utility vehicle (called MPV in Data Link reports), and car. NHTSA further divided the vehicle types into subcategories
of compact and standard to make average accident rate and rollover risk more meaningful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also divided injuries and fatalities between compact and standard versions of each vehicle type. To do this,
NHTSA assumed that rollover harm was proportional to the number of rollover accidents within a vehicle type. The numbers
of rollover accidents among compact vehicles relative to those among their standard counterparts were estimated
by multiplying their 1991 production ratios by their single vehicle accident per registered vehicle ratios and their
RO/SVA ratios. The total number of injuries and fatalities was then divided proportionally.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reduction in rollover harm for each type/size category is a summary of the reductions in injuries and fatalities
for each example vehicle within the category if the tilt table angle for the category were increased a specified level.
The reduction in harm associated with each affected vehicle is assumed to be proportional to its projected reduction
in rollover risk. A minimum tilt table angle standard of 42.8 degrees, an increase of one increment explained above,
would be expected to reduce serious rollover injuries by 13 and rollover fatalities by 8. A minimum tilt table angle
standard of 46.4 degrees, the highest measurement in the range studied, would be expected to reduce serious rollover
injuries by 233 and rollover fatalities by 121, if rollover avoidance were viewed as crash avoidance. A parallel exercise
was done using the rollover risk predicted using critical sliding velocity as the stability metric in the logistic
regression model.

3. Injury/Fatality Rate Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the agency assumed that a single vehicle accident would still occur even though a rollover was prevented,
it reduced these estimates of benefits based on a comparison of the relative harm of single vehicle accidents with
rollover to that of similar accidents without rollover. The comparison indicated that the overall fatality rate
for single vehicle rollover accidents was 2.07 times the fatality rate for single vehicle accidents without rollover.
When only accidents occurring on roads with speed limits of 40&hyph;50 mph are considered, the rollover accidents
are 2.3 times as likely to result in fatality. When accidents on 55&hyph;65 mph roads are considered, the fatality
rate of rollover accidents is 1.6 times that for other accidents. These statistics suggest that rollover prevention
is equivalent to about a 50 percent reduction in fatalities for the number of accidents in which rollovers would be
prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the injury data indicate an overall relative rate of serious injuries (AIS 3+) 1.36 times greater for single
vehicle accidents with rollover than without rollover. The ratio of AIS 3+ injuries in non-rollover to AIS 3+ injuries
in rollovers was 1.38 for accidents occurring on roads with speed limits of 40&hyph;50 mph and 1.47 for accidents occurring
on 55&hyph;65 mph roads. These statistics suggest that rollover prevention is roughly equivalent to a 25 percent
reduction in serious injuries for the number of accidents in which rollovers would be prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Viewing rollover prevention as roughly a 50 percent mitigation of fatalities and a 25 percent mitigation of serious
injuries leads to an estimate of net benefits resulting from the reduction in harm from rollover accidents. Net reductions
of 3 to 61 serious injuries and 4 to 63 fatalities would be expected for a minimum tilt table angle standard in the range
of 42.8 to 46.4 degrees. Net reductions of 3 to 68 serious injuries and 2 to 68 fatalities would be expected for a minimum
critical sliding velocity standard in the range studied, i.e., 14.68 to 16.73 kph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimum rollover stability requirements at the levels examined would have minimal impact on the annual single vehicle
accident rollover fatality toll, because the vehicles affected would be less than 20 percent of the total light duty
vehicle fleet and the vehicles' stability would only be improved by a marginal amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The great majority of rollover fatalities would be unaffected by a minimum stability standard set at any of these levels,
because they occur in cars, which greatly outnumber light trucks in use, and which, with few exceptions, have significantly
higher rollover stability than sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans.

B. Estimate of the Costs of a Standard

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained above, the agency's analyses predicted a saving of 63 lives for a minimum tilt table angle of 46.4 degrees.
This level would necessitate the modification of an estimated 87 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles
and virtually all present standard vans. A minimum tilt table angle of 45 degrees, which is higher than the tilt table
angle of 69 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles, could save 23 lives. Similarly, a minimum critical
sliding velocity standard of 16.73 kph would affect 89 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles, 38 percent
of standard sport utility vehicles, and 38 percent of compact pickups, while saving 68 lives. A critical sliding velocity
minimum standard of 15.91 kph would affect 71 percent of compact sport utility vehicles and 31 percent of compact pickups,
while saving 34 lives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, inexpensive vehicle changes, such as offset wheels or modified tire and rim width combinations,
cannot be counted on to improve stability without producing handling or steering problems. An increase in track width,
derived from frame or suspension alterations, or a decrease in center of gravity height are the only methods of improving
stability without potential safety liabilities. Such changes would require large initial costs related to the design
and development of major vehicle components, if not the entire vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These costs do not take into account the cost of the tests necessary to determine the tilt table angle or critical sliding
velocity. Because these costs will also be associated with the proposed consumer information regulation, the testing
costs are discussed later in this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the changes necessary to comply with a minimum standard may also be incompatible with some of the vehicle characteristics
many consumers seek in vehicles such as sport utility vehicles, vans, motor homes, and campers. For example, in the
case of sport utility vehicles, the capability to operate in off-road conditions may require both high ground clearance
(necessitating a relatively high center of gravity) and narrow width to maneuver in wooded or rocky areas (necessitating
a relatively narrow track width). Section 103(f)(3) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act provides
that a Federal motor vehicle safety standard must be reasonable and appropriate for each vehicle type to which it applies,
and therefore NHTSA could not mandate a stability requirement incompatible with certain types of vehicles. In addition,
the manufacturers of many of these types of vehicles would be considered small businesses, and a standard could raise
concerns under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another possible cost of a minimum rollover standard is decreased fuel economy. Compact sport utility vehicles have
become popular, in part, because the original sport utility vehicles, which were larger, heavier, and more stable
against rollover, were also more difficult to park and maneuver and had very poor fuel mileage. The compact sport utility
vehicles with higher stability tend to be the larger vehicles in the class, or open vehicles with less mass in the top.
A stability standard would be expected to cause a growth in size and weight of compact sport utility vehicles and a reduction
in fuel mileage.

C. Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on these estimates of the benefits and costs of a minimum stability standard, NHTSA believes that the benefits
would not be sufficient to justify the expected costs. Therefore, as noted above, NHTSA has decided to defer any further
action on this subject until information becomes available demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such a rule.
The agency may reinitiate such a rulemaking upon receipt of such information. This termination of rulemaking on vehicle
stability fulfills the statutory mandate of Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency is terminating rulemaking on a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA believes that the correlation
between stability and rollover risk is significant enough to justify proposing a consumer information regulation
to relieve the possibility of uninformed risk. The agency's decision to propose such a regulation is explained below.

VII. Proposed Consumer Information Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing a new consumer information regulation requiring manufacturers to report the stability metric
of cars and light trucks to enable consumers to make more informed choices concerning the trade-offs of vehicle attributes
and rollover stability. NHTSA believes that a consumer information regulation would inform drivers of general differences
in stability between light trucks and cars, and among vehicles in those classes so that consumers can make an informed
choice concerning relative rollover risk. This regulation would inform drivers who still chose a less stable vehicle
that they may wish to drive more cautiously in certain circumstances and that the higher risk of driving low stability
vehicles can be greatly reduced by using safety belts. In addition, NHTSA believes that a consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regulation would motivate manufacturers to give more priority to rollover stability in the design of
new vehicles. NHTSA believes these goals can be accomplished with a minimum burden on industry and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that consumer and manufacturer behavior can be affected through the provision of consumer information.
The agency's experience with the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) demonstrates the power of consumer information.
Several manufacturers have informed the agency that they have internal goals of performing well in these 35 mph frontal
crash tests, even though there is no regulatory requirement to do so. The lowering of the injury scores over time for
all manufacturers, as reported in ``Report on the Historical Performance of Different Auto Manufacturers in the
New Car Assessment Program Tests'', NHTSA, August 1993, can also be attributed partially to NCAP. The attention of
the media to the program and the more than 20,000 calls annually to NHTSA's Hotline, the most for any NHTSA consumer
information activity, speak to the consumer's interest in relevant consumer safety information. As to whether consumers
want information on rollover, recent agency focus groups indicate they would (``Focus Groups on Traffic Safety Issues:
Public Response to NCAP,'' S.W. Morris &amp; Company, Inc., August 1993, which can be found in Docket No. 79&hyph;17,
Notice 01). The consensus of the focus groups was that the agency's consumer safety information activities should
be expanded to include additional kinds of crashes, including rollover. Consumers also desired point of sale information,
which would be satisfied with the proposed vehicle sticker requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA does not agree with those manufacturers who believe that labeling vehicles with stability information will
mislead consumers or that consumers would consider the metric an absolute measure of the likelihood of rollover,
regardless of driver behavior or roadway conditions. It has never been shown that improvements in safety or availability
of information regarding safety increase risk-taking. In addition, the proposed label not only contains the stability
information, it contains the statements: ``All vehicles roll over! Always wear seat belts! In a rollover crash, an

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unbelted
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 person is 6 to 9 times more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.'' These statements emphasize to the consumer
that a vehicle with a higher stability rating can still roll over. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is considering two possible options for specifying the stability metric. Under option one, NHTSA would select
one of two metrics, critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle, and require the metric to be stated for each vehicle.
NHTSA requests comments on which metric is preferable if NHTSA selects only one metric. (Note: The proposed regulatory
text in this notice illustrates this option first for critical sliding velocity, and then for tilt table angle.) Under
option two, NHTSA would not require a metric to be stated. Instead, the agency would require vehicles to be labeled
with a statement concerning the rollover stability (e.g., one, two, or three stars) based on vehicle performance
when tested for one or both of the metrics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Proposed Label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require three types of information on the label and in owner's manuals. First, manufacturers
would be required to include the stability metric for that vehicle. This information would either be the same as that
reported by the manufacturer to NHTSA (for option one) or the ``rating'' provided by NHTSA (for option two). This metric
would be required to be reported ``accurate to the nearest kilometer per hour'' for critical sliding velocity and
``accurate to the nearest degree'' for tilt table angle. As explained in the discussion of the two metrics in this notice,
NHTSA believes that the test procedure for both metrics produces results repeatable to this degree of accuracy. Manufacturers
would be allowed to choose which models and configurations could be grouped together, because they have the same metric,
for the purpose of reporting metrics. However, for each metric reported by a manufacturer, the manufacturer would
have to fully describe the vehicles to which the metric applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the label would be required to contain the metric or rating ranges provided by NHTSA for both passenger cars
and light trucks. The purpose of this requirement is to emphasize to consumers that there are significant differences
between the stability of the average passenger car and that of the average truck-based vehicle. This information
would allow consumers to make an informed choice in purchasing a passenger car or a truck-based vehicle and to compare
a vehicle they are considering to other vehicles in its class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, NHTSA is proposing to require a warning to inform consumers that all vehicles can, and do, roll over and that
the best protection against injury or fatality, should a rollover occur, is wearing seat belts.

C. Stability Metrics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, NHTSA's analyses indicate that there are two metrics, critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle,
which correlate well with rollover accident data. Either of these metrics could be used in a stability labeling regulation.
Each has its advantages and disadvantages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical sliding velocity, a dynamic metric, includes the influence of roll moment of inertia as well as the various
static factors included by the static metrics such as tilt table angle. The advantage of critical sliding velocity
is that it more consistently predicts rollover risk for light trucks. The disadvantage is that calculation of critical
sliding velocity requires knowledge of the vehicle's center of gravity height and roll mass moment of inertia. These
two parameters are difficult to measure on complete vehicles and require specialized equipment to obtain accurate
results. However, these parameters can be measured on vehicle components and manufacturers of complete vehicles
could calculate center of gravity height and roll mass moment of inertia of complete vehicles from data they have on
component parameters. However, the agency is unsure whether final stage manufacturers and alterers of specialty
vehicles are provided enough information from incomplete vehicle manufacturers to do this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tilt table angle, a static metric, is simple and inexpensive to measure. The nature of the test is easy for the consumer
to understand. The disadvantage of this metric stems from the statistical relationship between tilt table angle
and accident data. The correlation between tilt table angle and accident data breaks down if passenger cars are analyzed
separately from light trucks. Further, statistical models containing tilt table angle data consistently overestimate
the rollover risk for standard vans.

Calculation of critical sliding velocity requires knowledge of the vehicle's mass, track width, center of gravity
height, and roll moment of inertia. NHTSA agrees with commenters that the center of gravity height and roll moment
of inertia are complicated measurements. To address comments on the repeatability of center of gravity height measurement,
NHTSA reviewed two reports.

The study ``Center of Gravity Height: A Round-Robin Measurement Program,'' sponsored by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association and conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI&hyph;91&hyph;4)
compared the test facilities, procedures, and results of center of gravity height measurements at four laboratories.
Each of the four laboratories used different test equipment and procedures. The study concluded that different measurement
procedures can produce significantly different results. However, the study also concluded that for each laboratory
and test procedure, repeatability was very good.

facility to be 0.8 percent. The measurements used in the analyses of the relationship of critical sliding velocity
and single vehicle rollover accidents came from the VRTC facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these studies, NHTSA believes that measurements of center of gravity height and roll moment of inertia are
repeatable within an individual laboratory using a specified procedure. NHTSA also believes that these measurements
would be repeatable among different laboratories if all were using the same test procedure. The agency has data on
a group of six make/models of light trucks and one make/model of car for which tests were run on identical vehicles,
or repeated tests were run on the same vehicle. The results for all of these tests show the repeatability of critical
sliding velocity to be well within the required accuracy of one kilometer per hour. Therefore, NHTSA tentatively
concludes that the test procedure proposed in this notice would produce repeatable results. The proposed regulatory
text does not include language for either the test equipment or the test procedure. The test equipment to be used in
the procedure is VTRC's Inertial Parameter Measuring Device (IPMD). The equipment is described in United States
Patent No. 5,177,998. VRTC is in the process of refining the test procedure for use with the IPMD, which is described
in the report, ``Vehicle Inertial Parameters_Measured Values and Approximations,'' by Garrott

2. Tilt Table Angle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters to the ANPRM stated that the tilt table procedure is not standard practice and its repeatability is
not known. Other commenters stated that the procedure was repeatable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA examined two studies which concluded that the tilt table test is a simple, repeatable method of estimating the
static roll stability of a vehicle. ``Sensitivity Analysis of the Tilt Table Test Methodology'' is a study sponsored
by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute (UMTRI&hyph;91&hyph;48 December 1991). UMTRI found the tilt table test to be repeatable in their laboratory
and found nothing to prevent site-to-site reproducibility. The other study is a NHTSA study which found the following
parameters to be critical to achieving an accurate tilt table angle: slow, steady lift rate, minimal platform deflection,
platform angle measurement accurate to 0.1 degree, and accuracy of measurement of the point at which the last tire
leaves the table (DOT HS 807 747 May 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these studies, NHTSA believes that the tilt table test would result in repeatable measurements if conducted
under specified conditions. The agency's results for either tests on identical vehicles or multiple tests on the
same vehicle show the repeatability of tilt table angle to be within the required accuracy of one degree. To ensure
repeatability, NHTSA has included specific test conditions in the tilt table angle test procedure.

D. Timing of Information Provided by the Manufacturers and NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By each January 1st, each manufacturer would be required to report to NHTSA the stability metric for each vehicle to
be manufactured on or after the next September 1 and on or before the first August 31 following that September 1st. Thus,
the information for ``1997 model year'' vehicles (vehicles manufactured between September 1, 1996 and August 31,
1997) would have to be reported by January 1, 1996. NHTSA recognizes that not all manufacturers change to production
of a new model year on the same date. If a manufacturer changes production on a date after September 1, and the difference
between model years affects the stability metric, the manufacturer would have to report a metric for two ``vehicles''
for a single make/model. NHTSA requests comments on these proposed dates. NHTSA would consider changing the beginning
and ending date of the annual production period specified in this regulation if there was a different date that coincides
with a majority of manufacturers' ``model year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If option one, which is a quantitative measure based on vehicle metric calculations, were chosen for a final rule,
NHTSA would use the information provided by the manufacturers to supply manufacturers with ranges for all passenger
cars and light trucks for the upcoming model year by April 1 of that year (i.e., in the above example, NHTSA would provide
manufacturers ranges for 1997 model year vehicles by April 1, 1996.) If option two were chosen, NHTSA would use the
information provided to provide manufacturers with the ``rating'' which must be labeled on the vehicle. Since there
is a possibility that this information could not be provided by April 1, the agency requests comments on how much leadtime
manufacturers would need to place the information on labels and in owner's manuals on all vehicles manufactured on
or after September 1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to make this new regulation effective on January 1, 1996, based on the presumption that this would
give manufacturers at least one year to complete testing necessary to report the tilt table angle and/or critical
sliding velocity for all vehicles following publication of a final rule.

E. Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, NHTSA anticipates that this consumer information regulation will result in a more informed
public which, through purchasing and/or driving decisions, could improve motor vehicle safety. Similarly, consumer
purchasing behavior could affect manufacturers' design and/or marketing of vehicles. The agency is unable to quantify
at this time the benefits of this rulemaking. A more detailed discussion of the possible benefits of this rulemaking
can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs associated with the proposed consumer information regulation would arise from three different activities:
generating the stability metric for the label, printing the labels, and affixing labels to the vehicles. This rule
would not require manufacturers to make vehicle changes. While such modifications are desirable, they are not mandated,
and if they occurred, would be the indirect result of market forces and not a direct result of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in detail in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA estimates that the total testing and labeling
costs of a regulation based on critical sliding velocity would range from $4.71 to $6.35 million and the total cost
of a regulation based on tilt table angle would range from $3.93 to $5.57 million.

VIII. Final Stage Manufacturers and Alterers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA requests comments on how final stage manufacturers and alterers would comply with the proposed consumer information
regulation. Would final stage manufacturers and alterers have sufficient information on upcoming model year vehicles
to report the tilt table angle and/or critical sliding velocity of the vehicles they will be producing by January 1
as required? How much information can incomplete vehicle manufacturers pass on to final stage manufacturers to assist
them in predicting the tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity of the final vehicle, and when? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also asks for comment on how many vehicles in this category would have a GVWR of 4,536 kilograms or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that many of these vehicles are manufactured for special uses, NHTSA requests comments on whether certain types
of vehicles (e.g., walk-in van-type vehicles, campers, and motor homes) should be excluded from the consumer information
requirement. Would consumer choice for these special-use vehicles be affected by the information provided by this
proposed regulation?

under E.O. 12866. The agency's detailed analysis of the economic effects can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory
Evaluation available in the docket for this rulemaking. The agency estimates that the proposed regulation would
cost $3.93 to $6.35 million annually.

NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As explained
above, NHTSA does not expect any significant economic impacts from this proposed rule. While the agency has asked
questions regarding the availability of data to certain manufacturers who could be small businesses (final stage
manufacturers and alterers), NHTSA believes that these manufacturers will be able to obtain sufficient information
on the vehicles they complete or alter that this proposed regulation will not impose a significantly different burden
on these manufacturers.

Vehicle Positioning
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The test vehicle is positioned on the tilt table such that the vehicle's longitudinal axis is parallel to the axis
of rotation of the table and the left side of the vehicle is positioned such that the driver's side of the vehicle will
be on the low side when the table is tilted. The wheels are parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After the vehicle has been positioned in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the engine is turned
off. For automatic transmission vehicles, the transmission is in Park or, if the vehicle does not have a Park position,
the transmission is placed in the Neutral position and the parking brake applied such that the vehicle does not roll
during the test. For manual transmission vehicles, the transmission is in first gear and the parking brake is applied
such that the vehicle does not roll during the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 31 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI), Amendment 35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA),
and a regulatory amendment affecting the fishery for Pacific halibut in and off the State of Alaska (Alaska or State).
This action is being proposed to implement the Modified Block Proposal, to clarify the transfer process for the Individual
Fishing Quota (IFQ) program, and to prevent excessive consolidation of the Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries
off Alaska. If approved, these FMP and regulatory amendments would require the issuance of quota share (QS) blocks
for QS resulting in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ for halibut or sablefish, based on the 1994 total allowable catch
(TAC) for fixed gear in those fisheries, allow the combination of QS blocks that are less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ
for halibut and less than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish, restrict the number of blocks that may be held by a person
in any IFQ regulatory area, and clarify the transfer process for QS and IFQ. It is intended to ensure that small part-time
operators and diversified operations can continue to participate profitably in the IFQ fisheries.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Sitka Block proposed amendment, the Full/Partial Block proposed amendment, the Modified Block proposed amendment,
and the status quo alternative for the IFQ program for fixed-gear sablefish fisheries off Alaska and for the fixed-gear
Pacific halibut fisheries in and off Alaska are described in the EA/RIR/IRFA dated December 17, 1993. Language amending
the BSAI and the GOA FMPs was developed for the Modified Block Proposal, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council's
(Council) chosen alternative. The amendments to the FMPs affect the sablefish fisheries in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Alaska, which are managed in accordance with the BSAI and the GOA groundfish FMPs. The Council prepared
both FMPs under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The BSAI FMP is
implemented by regulations appearing at 50 CFR 611.93 for the foreign fishery and 50 CFR part 675 for the U.S. fishery.
The GOA FMP is implemented by regulations appearing at 50 CFR 611.92 for the foreign fishery and at 50 CFR part 672 for
the U.S. fishery. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council does not have an FMP for halibut. The domestic fishery for halibut in and off Alaska is managed by the International
Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation
of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention), signed at Washington, DC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 29, 1979, and the Halibut Act. The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the Regional Fishery Management
Councils established by the Magnuson Act to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with,
regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop,
for approval by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), limited-access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery
in Convention waters in and off Alaska. ``Convention waters'' means the maritime areas off the west coast of the United
States and Canada, as described in Article I of the Convention (see 16 U.S.C. 773(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council acted under these authorities in recommending changes to the IFQ program for the halibut and sablefish
fisheries. These recommended changes would be implemented by this proposed action and are intended by the Council
to promote the conservation and management of sablefish and halibut resources, and to further the objectives of the
Magnuson Act and the Halibut Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern over the potential for excessive consolidation of fishing privileges under the IFQ program was the impetus
for the QS block proposals. The Council asked its staff to analyze the first of the QS block proposals, the Sitka Block
proposal, at its April 1992 meeting. The Sitka Block proposal provided that (1) initial QS for each IFQ regulatory
area would be allocated in blocks, (2) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to be transferred as a block,
and (3) the ``maximum block size'' allowed in each IFQ regulatory area would be one-half the most restrictive QS use
limit for an area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Full/Partial Block proposal was considered at the January 1993 Council meeting. It provided that (1) initial
QS for each IFQ regulatory area would be allocated in blocks, (2) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to
be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred as a block, (3) QS that represented 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year would be issued
as a ``full block'' for that IFQ regulatory area, and (4) QS that represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) would be issued
as a ``partial block'' for that IFQ regulatory area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Modified Block proposed amendment was passed after the Council took public testimony and discussed the other
two block proposals at its September 1993 meeting. The Modified Block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposal retained most of the features of the current IFQ program, including the same ownership constraints and the
same vessel size categories. The Modified Block Proposal also provided that (1) only initial allocations of QS that
represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year would be issued as a block, (2) QS that represented
20,000 lb 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year would be ``unblocked'' QS, and (3) QS in a block could not be separated
and would have to be transferred as a block. For each species in each IFQ regulatory area, a person who did not hold any
unblocked QS could hold up to two QS blocks for that area, but the sum of the two QS blocks could not exceed use limits in
50 CFR 676.22 (e) and (f). A person who held unblocked QS for an IFQ regulatory area could hold only one QS block for that
area, provided that the total QS held, blocked and unblocked, for that IFQ regulatory area did not exceed use limits
referenced above. The Modified Block Proposal also provided that QS blocks resulting in less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt)
of IFQ for halibut (or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish) in the implementation year could be combined. The QS block
resulting from this combination could not exceed 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) for halibut or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish. This
``sweeping-up'' provision was designed to allow very small QS allocations to be combined into ``fishable'' amounts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All three block proposals, the Sitka Block Proposal, the Full/Partial Block Proposal, and the Modified Block Proposal,
were designed to reduce the maximum potential consolidation relative to the current IFQ program. The EA/RIR/IRFA
indicated that, if actual consolidation is proportional to the estimates of maximum potential consolidation, more
QS holders likely would remain in the halibut and sablefish fisheries under any of the three block proposals than under
the current IFQ program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council adopted the Modified Block Proposal because it prevented excessive consolidation of QS by blocking any
QS allocation for an IFQ regulatory area that would have represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation
year (1994). Also, it did not unnecessarily interfere with the opportunities currently available under the IFQ program
for larger operations, because QS allocations for an IFQ regulatory area that would have represented 20,000 lb (9
mt) or more of IFQ in 1994 would remain unblocked. The Council decided that the Modified Block Proposal would achieve
the objectives of the other block proposals (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, protect small producers, part-time participants, and entry level participants that may tend to disappear because
of excessive consolidation under the current IFQ program), with fewer restrictions on the flexibility and the economic
efficiency of the IFQ program as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether QS is blocked or unblocked would be determined by the QS pools for each IFQ regulatory area as they exist on October
17, 1994. Using a specific date to calculate whether to block QS ensures that all persons would be treated in a similar
manner, regardless of when their QS is issued. October 17, 1994, was chosen as the date to calculate QS because it was
long enough after the application period (ends July 15, 1994) to allow the QS pools to achieve QS amounts reflective
of their eventual range, but long enough before the 1995 fishing season to allow for transfers of QS for that fishing
season.

Transfer of QS Blocks

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Blocked and unblocked QS would be transferable subject to the approval of the Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS,
and compliance with the transfer regulations found in 50 CFR part 676. The Modified Block Proposal creates the potential
that some QS blocks would become non-transferable, because their size would exceed the QS use limits in 50 CFR 676.22
(e) and (f). This potential was addressed in the EA/RIR/IRFA dated December 17, 1993. Since there was only a slight
potential of having a QS block that would be non-transferable, and only a few regulatory areas were affected, an alternative
was developed to solve the issue of non-transferability, rather than totally abandoning the Modified Block Proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This alternative would permit the transfer of a QS block that exceeded the QS use limits by dividing the block into two
blocks. The sizes of the resulting blocks would depend on the QS use limit preventing the transfer_one block would
be the maximum size allowable under the QS use limit, the other block would contain the residual QS. Dividing a block
to allow its transfer when it would be otherwise non-transferable because it exceeded the QS use limit is an exception
to the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;676.21(d)(1)). Under any other circumstance, a QS block could not be divided.

Furthermore, this alternative does not waive any of the other use limits under the existing IFQ program or under the
changes proposed to the program by this action. For example, a person may only hold two QS blocks for an IFQ regulatory
area, or one QS block if any unblocked QS is held. Also, a person cannot exceed the QS use limit by transfer. These limits
would prevent a person from receiving, by transfer, the two blocks created by dividing a block because its size exceeded
the QS use limit. If a person held any QS for an IFQ regulatory area, blocked or unblocked, the most he/she would be able
to receive by transfer would be one block. If a person did not hold any QS for an IFQ regulatory area, he/she would still
be prevented from receiving both blocks, because the sum of the QS in both blocks would exceed the QS use limit for that
regulatory area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action proposes changes to the transfer procedure in 50 CFR part 676 to accommodate the Modified Block Proposal,
and to further clarify the transfer process. First, a definition of transfer of QS or IFQ would be included in the introductory
paragraph of &sect;676.21. Second, &sect;676.21(e) would be revised and placed at &sect;676.21 (a), (b), and (c).
Third, procedures designed specifically for transferring QS blocks would be placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;676.21(d). Fourth, procedures for transfers of QS or IFQ resulting from court orders, operation of law, or
as part of security agreements would be clarified and placed in &sect;676.21(e). Fifth, transfer restrictions specific
to regulatory areas would be expanded and placed in &sect;676.21(f). Making the transfer process easier to understand
is the impetus for these proposed changes. NMFS is particularly interested in public comments regarding these changes
to the existing transfer process for QS and IFQ, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by a Council within
15 days of receipt of the FMP amendments and regulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined that the FMP
amendments these regulations would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the
Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making final determinations about the FMP amendments
and in promulgating final rules under both the Magnuson and Halibut Acts, will take into account the data, views, and
comments received during the comment period.

The Council prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which describes the impact this proposed rule would have on small entities,
if adopted. The analysis in the IRFA indicates that by reducing consolidation, the Modified Block Proposal may increase
the total cost of harvesting the fishery resource, thereby decreasing the net economic benefits of the IFQ program
and increasing harvesting costs to small entities. The analysis also indicates that by reducing consolidation,
the Modified Block Proposal may result in higher levels of harvesting employment. Higher levels of harvesting employment
and the maintenance of diversity in fishing operations participating in the IFQ program are the main goals of the Modified
Block Proposal. A copy of the analysis is available from the Council (see

 A person who receives QS by transfer may not use IFQ resulting from that QS for harvesting halibut or sablefish with
fixed gear until an Application for Transfer of QS/IFQ (Application for Transfer) is approved by the Regional Director.
The Regional Director shall provide an Application for Transfer form to any person on request. Persons who submit
an Application for Transfer to the Regional Director for approval will receive notice of the Regional Director's
decision to approve or disapprove the Application for Transfer, and, if applicable, the reason(s) for disapproval,
by mail posted on the date of that decision, unless another communication mode is requested on the Application for
Transfer. QS or IFQ accounts affected by an Application for Transfer approved by the Regional Director will change
on the date of approval. Any necessary IFQ permits will be sent with the notice of the Regional Director's decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfers of QS blocks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A QS block must be transferred as an undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block exceeds the use limits specified
at &sect;676.22. If the QS block to be transferred exceeds the use limits specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;676.22, the Regional Director will divide the block into two blocks, one block containing the maximum amount
of QS allowable under the QS use limits and the other block containing the residual QS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) QS blocks representing less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut or less than 3,000 lb (1.9 mt) for sablefish,
based on the factors listed in &sect;676.20(a), for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, may be consolidated
into larger QS blocks, provided that the consolidated QS blocks do not represent greater than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ
for halibut or greater than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish based on the factors listed in &sect;676.20(a). A
consolidated QS block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use and transferability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfer of QS or IFQ with restrictions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If QS or IFQ must be transferred as a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement, but
the person receiving the QS or IFQ by transfer does not meet all of the eligibility requirements of this section, the
Regional Director will approve the Application for Transfer with restrictions. The Regional Director will not assign
IFQ resulting from the restricted QS to any person. IFQ with restrictions may not be used for harvesting halibut or
sablefish with fixed gear. The QS or IFQ will remain restricted until: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions meets the eligibility requirements of this section and
the Regional Director approves an Application for Eligibility for that person; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Regional Director approves the Application for Transfer from the person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions
to a person who meets the requirements of this section.

Transfer restrictions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) or paragraph (f)(2)) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members,
or that were initially assigned catcher vessel QS, and meet the other requirements in this section may receive catcher
vessel QS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members may receive catcher
vessel QS in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;W. long. for sablefish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Catcher vessel QS initially assigned to an individual may be transferred to a corporation that is solely owned
by the same individual. Such transfers of catcher vessel QS in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory
area east of 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;W. long. for sablefish will be governed by the use provisions of &sect;676.22(i); the use provisions pertaining
to corporations at &sect;676.22(j) shall not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Regional Director will not approve an Application for Transfer of catcher vessel QS subject to a lease or any
other condition of repossession or resale by the person transferring QS, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this
section, or by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. The Regional Director may request
a copy of the sales contract or other terms and conditions of transfer between two persons as supplementary information
to the transfer application.

Leasing QS (applicable until January 2, 1998).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A person may not use IFQ resulting from a QS lease for harvesting halibut or sablefish until an Application for Transfer
complying with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and the lease agreement are approved by the Regional
Director. A person may lease no more than 10 percent of that person's total catcher vessel QS for any IFQ species in any
IFQ regulatory area to one or more persons for any fishing year. After approving the Application for Transfer, the
Regional Director shall change any IFQ accounts affected by an approved QS lease and issue all necessary IFQ permits.
QS leases must comply with all transfer requirements specified in this section. All leases will expire on December
31 of the calendar year for which they are approved.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is seeking comments on a proposal for a national, industry-funded
promotion and information program for fresh cut flowers and fresh cut greens (cut flowers and greens). An order for
the proposed program_the Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and Information Order_was submitted to
the Department by the Promoflor Organizing Group, Inc. The Department is also seeking comments on proposals submitted
by the Florists' Transworld Delivery Association and the Produce Marketing Association which cover only one portion
of the proposed order. Under the proposed order, handlers would pay an assessment based on their gross sales of cut
flowers and greens, regardless of the country of origin, to the proposed National PromoFlor Council. Composed of
handlers, growers, importers, and retailers, the Council would use the assessments collected to conduct a generic
promotion and information program to maintain, expand, and develop markets for cut flowers and greens.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed order is issued under the Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and Information Act of 1993
[Pub. L. 103&hyph;190] approved December 14, 1993, hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and the Office of Management
and Budget has determined that it is a ``significant regulatory action.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;8
of the Act, after an order is implemented, a person subject to the order may file a petition with the Secretary stating
that the order or any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance
with law and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption from the order. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity
for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides
that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries
on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that
purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this proposed action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only those wholesale handlers, retail distribution centers, producers, and importers who have annual sales of $750,000
or more of cut flowers and greens and sell those products to exempt handlers, retailers, or consumers would be considered
to be qualified handlers and assessed under the order. There are approximately 900 wholesalers, 150 importers, and
200 domestic producers who would be qualified handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of these qualified handlers would be classified as small businesses. As defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] small agricultural service firms, which would include the qualified handlers who
would be required to pay assessments under the order, have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than
$5,000,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistics reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service show that 1993 sales at wholesale of domestic
cut flowers and greens total approximately $535 million while the value of imports during 1993 was approximately
$382 million. The leading States in the United States producing cut flowers and greens, by wholesale value, are California,
which produces approximately 60 percent of the domestic crop, followed by Florida, Colorado, Washington, New York,
Hawaii, and Pennsylvania. Major countries exporting cut flowers and greens into the United States, by value, are
Colombia, which accounts for approximately 60 percent, followed by The Netherlands, Mexico, and Costa Rica. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first three years the order is in effect, the rate of assessment may not exceed 0.5 percent of the gross sales
of cut flowers and greens. After the order has been in effect for three years, the assessment rate may be increased or
decreased by no more that 0.25 percent each year when recommended by two-thirds of the members of the National PromoFlor
Council (Council) and approved by the Secretary. However, at no time may the assessment rate exceed 1.0 percent of
gross sales of cut flowers and greens. Notice and comment rulemaking would be required to change the assessment rate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the maximum assessment collection is expected to total about $10 million annually, the economic impact
of a 1.0 percent or less assessment on each qualified handler would not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the proposed order would impose certain recordkeeping requirements on qualified handlers, information required
under the proposed order could be compiled from records currently maintained. Thus, any added burden resulting from
increased recordkeeping would not be significant when compared to the benefits that should accrue to such businesses.
The proposed order's provisions have been carefully reviewed, and every effort has been made to minimize any unnecessary
recordkeeping costs or requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the order would impose some additional costs and requirements on qualified handlers, it is anticipated
that the program under the proposed order would help to increase the demand for cut flowers and greens. Therefore,
any additional costs should be offset by the benefits derived from expanded markets and sales benefiting all segments
of the floral industry. Accordingly, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the provisions of the proposed
order would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to establish a national cut flowers and greens promotion
and consumer information program. The program would be funded by an assessment levied on qualified handlers not to
exceed 1 percent of their gross sales of cut flowers and greens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for the submission of proposals for a cut flowers and greens promotion and consumer information order
by industry organizations or any other interested person affected by the Act. The Act requires that such a proposed
order provide for the establishment of a National PromoFlor Council. The Council would be composed of 25 voting members:
14 members representing qualified wholesale handlers of domestic and imported cut flowers and greens; 3 members
representing producers who are qualified handlers of cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing importers who
are qualified handlers of cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing traditional retailers of cut flowers and
greens; and 2 members representing persons who produce cut flowers and greens. Each member shall have an alternate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department issued a news release on February 17, 1994, requesting proposals for an initial order or portions of
an initial order.

Proposal I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An entire proposed order was submitted by the PromoFlor Organizing Group, Inc. (PromoFlor). PromoFlor is an industry
group created and sponsored by 68 floral industry organizations and more than 700 floral businesses solely for the
purpose of developing and implementing a promotion and consumer information order for cut flowers and greens. PromoFlor
represents a substantial number of industry members who would be assessed under the proposed order. Once the order
is established, PromoFlor would no longer exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is publishing PromoFlor's proposed order as Proposal I. The Department has modified PromoFlor's
proposed text (1) to make it consistent with the Act and other similar national research and promotion programs supervised
by the Department, (2) to simplify the language and format of some provisions, and (3) to add certain sections necessary
for proper administration of the Order by the Department.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed order submitted by PromoFlor is summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.1&hyph;1208.22 of the proposed order define certain terms, such as floral products, qualified handler,
producer, and retailer, which are used in the proposed order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.30&hyph;1208.37 include provisions relating to the establishment, membership, nomination procedures,
appointment, terms of office, and reimbursement of members of the Council. Also PromoFlor would be designated as
an election committee for the initial nomination of members to the Council. After the Council is appointed, the Council
would be the election committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.40&hyph;1208.43 include powers and duties of the Council, which would be the body organized to administer
the order through the implementation of plans, projects, budgets, and contracts to promote and disseminate information
about cut flowers and greens, under the supervision of the Secretary. Further, the Council would be authorized to
incur expenses necessary for the performance of its duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.50&hyph;1208.57 would authorize the collection of assessments, specify who pays them and how, set
forth procedures for granting a postponement of the payment of an assessment for any qualified handler who is financially
unable to pay such assessment, set forth procedures for the handling of a one-time refund should the order fail to be
approved in referendum, authorize the Council to make determinations as to who are qualified handlers and who are
exempt handlers, and for establishing an operating monetary reserve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial assessment rate would be 0.5 percent of a qualified handler's gross sales during the first three years
the order is in effect. Thereafter, the rate may be increased or decreased by no more than 0.25 percent per year. A uniform
factor would be used for determining the assessment due on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-sale transfers to retailers and sales by importers who are qualified handlers directly to consumers. Another
uniform factor would be used for determining the assessment due on sales directly to consumers by producers who are
qualified handlers. Sales of cut flowers and greens to export markets would be exempt from assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment sections also outline the procedures to be followed by qualified handlers for remitting assessments;
establish a 1.5 percent per month interest charge for unpaid or late assessments; and provide for refunds of assessments
paid if the program does not continue after the initial referendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.60&hyph;1208.62 authorize the Secretary to suspend or terminate the order when deemed appropriate,
and prescribes proceedings after suspension or termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.70&hyph;1208.72 concern reporting and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for persons subject to the order and protect the confidentiality of information obtained from such
books, records, or reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1208.80&hyph;1208.85 are miscellaneous provisions including the provisions involving authority of
the Secretary; personal liability of Council members and employees; separability of order provisions; handling
of intellectual property, such as patents, arising from funds collected by the Council; and amendments to the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the proposal from PromoFlor, the Department received proposals addressing the nomination of the Council's
retailer members from Florists' Transworld Delivery Association (FTD) (see Proposal II) and the Produce Marketing
Association (PMA) (see Proposal III). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposal II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTD's proposal specifies that one of the three retailer members be appointed from nominations submitted by the American
Floral Marketing Council (AFMC) in accordance with the Act, that one retailer member be appointed from nominations
submitted by FTD, and that one retailer member be appointed from nominations submitted by a coalition of traditional
retail florist organizations. The FTD proposal also defines ``traditional retail florist organization'' as an
organization having membership exceeding 1,000 of which 75 percent would be traditional cut flowers and greens retailers
and such organization spends a portion of its revenue on marketing cut flowers and greens. The FTD proposal defines
``traditional cut flowers and greens retailer'' as small business establishments that operate from owned or leased
premises and derive 40 percent of their total volume of sales from cut flowers and greens. This definition would not
allow for mass-market retailers such as supermarket chains to be eligible to nominate candidates as members on the
Council. The FTD proposal further states that no traditional retail florist organization, including AFMC, would
be eligible to nominate members for more than one of the three retailer member positions. It is FTD's position that
it is the largest traditional retail florist organization in the industry and that it should be entitled to one member
and alternate on the Council.

Proposal III

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Produce Marketing Association (PMA) also submitted proposed definitions of ``traditional retailer'' and ``traditional
retail florist organization'' which would be used in determining eligibility to nominate retailer members for the
Council. PMA is the national trade association that represents the mass-market floral industry though its division,
the Floral Marketing Association. It is PMA's position that the definition of the term ``traditional'' should be
very broad and include any retailer whose primary business is the sale of floral products, including cut flowers and
greens or has a specific department dedicated to the sale of floral products including cut flowers and greens. Also,
PMA recommended that nominations be limited to national organizations. Further, PMA is in favor of keeping the two
retailer seats that were not designated for AFMC open to as large a segment of the floral industry as possible.

In addition to these proposals, the Department has received letters from several other floral industry groups regarding
qualifications for the retailer member seats on the Council. They include American Floral Services, Inc., Redbook
Floral Services, Teleflora, and Wholesale Florists and Florist Suppliers of America. Copies of these letters will

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) During the first three years after the effective date of this subpart:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of non-sale transfers to a retailer by a qualified handler that is a distribution center and in the case

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After the first three years that this subpart is in effect, the uniform assessment rate may be increased or decreased

the valuation of the cut flowers and greens for assessment purposes shall be the price paid by the distribution center
or importer to acquire the cut flowers and greens, and determined by multiplying the acquisition price by a uniform
factor of 1.43 to represent the markup of a wholesale handler on a sale to a retailer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of a direct sale to a consumer by a producer who is a qualified handler, the valuation of the cut flowers
and greens for assessment purposes shall be equal to an amount determined by multiplying the price paid by the consumer
by a uniform factor of 0.50 to represent the cost of producing the article and the markup of a wholesale handler on a sale
to a retailer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Council may consider and adopt changes in the uniform factors specified in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above.
Any such change shall not become effective until it has been adopted by a majority vote of the Council and approved by
the Secretary after public notice and opportunity to comment on such change as provided in the Act. Changes so adopted
and approved shall become effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that was determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a failure to submit a report when due shall
be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due. The timeliness
of a payment to the Council shall be based on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the Council,

Refunds of assessments and escrow account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any qualified handler may demand and receive from the escrow account, subject to the limitation on such payments
provided in paragraph (c), a one-time refund of any assessments paid by or on behalf of the handler if the handler requests
the refund before the initial referendum on this subpart is held and this subpart is rejected by the voters when it is
submitted to the referendum in accordance with &sect;1208.60(a). Such a refund will be paid only if all of the following
conditions are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The handler has paid the assessments sought to be refunded and has submitted proof of such payment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The handler does not support the program established under this subpart and so states in the handler's demand for
a refund;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The handler's demand for a refund is made on a form specified by the Council and filed not less than 10 days prior to
the date when the initial referendum, conducted pursuant to &sect;1208.60(a) to ascertain whether this subpart
shall remain in effect, is scheduled to begin; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) This subpart is not approved by a simple majority of the votes cast by qualified handlers in the initial referendum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Council shall establish an escrow account to be used for assessment refunds, as needed, and shall place into
the account an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of assessments collected during the period beginning
on the date this subpart becomes effective and ending on the date the results of the initial referendum are issued and
the initial referendum is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to refund the total amount of assessments demanded by all qualified
handlers determined eligible for refunds and this subpart is not approved in the referendum, the Council shall prorate
the amount of all such refunds among all eligible qualified handlers that demand the refund. If there is any amount
in excess of the amount needed to pay refunds and expenses, it shall be returned pro rata to those who paid assessments.
If this subpart is approved in the referendum, there shall be no refunds made, and all funds in the escrow account shall
be returned to the Council for use by the Council in accordance with the other provisions of this subpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Council may grant a postponement of the payment of an assessment under this subpart for any qualified handler
that establishes that it is financially unable to make the payment. In order that a qualified handler that is financially
unable to pay an assessment may have the opportunity to petition the Council to postpone payment of such an assessment,
as provided in the Act, the Council shall develop forms and procedures for this purpose as expeditiously as possible
and submit them to the Secretary for approval and issuance after notice and an opportunity for public comment thereon.
Such procedures shall, among other things, require that the handler demonstrate the handler's inability to pay through
the submission of an opinion prepared by an independent certified public accountant (at the handler's expense) and
any other documentation specified therein to the effect that the handler is insolvent or will be unable to continue
to operate if the handler is required to pay the assessment when due.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The procedures for obtaining a postponement of payment to be developed by the Council for submission to the Secretary
shall also include provisions with respect to the period of postponement, the conditions of payment that may be imposed
and the basis, if any, on which further extensions of the time for payment will be granted so as to appropriately reflect
the demonstrated needs of the qualified handler.

distribution centers that are qualified handlers, producers that are qualified handlers, importers that are qualified
handlers, as well as such other determinations of status and facts as may be required for the effective administration
of this subpart. Based on such determinations, the Council from time to time shall publish lists of exempt handlers
who are not required to pay assessments, and lists of qualified handlers who are required to pay assessments under
this subpart.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) For the purpose of applying the $750,000 annual sales limitation to a specific person in order to determine the
status of the person as a qualified handler or an exempt handler or to a specific facility in order to determine the status
of the facility as an eligible separate facility for the purpose of referenda, the Council is authorized to determine
the annual sales volume of a person or facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any such determination shall be based on the sales of cut flowers and greens by the person or facility during the
most recently-completed calendar year, except that in the case of a new business or other operation for which complete
data on sales during all or part of the most recently-completed calendar year are not available to the Council, the
determination may be made using an alternative time period or other alternative procedures as the Council may find
appropriate. In making such determinations, the Council is authorized to make attributions in accordance with the
following rules and for the purpose of determining the annual sales volume of a person or a separate facility of a person,
sales attributable to a person shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In the case of an individual, sales attributable to the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents
of the person;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of a partnership or member of a partnership, sales attributable to the partnership and other partners
of the partnership;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case of an individual or a partnership, sales attributable to any corporation or other entity in which the
individual or partnership owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity is not a corporation) that the individual
or partnership controls; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In the case of a corporation, sales attributable to any corporate subsidiary or other corporation or entity in
which the corporation owns more than 50 percent of the stock or (if the entity is not a corporation) that the corporation
controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Council is also authorized to attribute any stock ownership interest as may be required to carry out this subpart.
In doing so a stock ownership interest in the entity that is owned by the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents,
grandparents, or partners of an individual, or by a partnership in which a person is a partner, or by a corporation more
than 50 percent of the stock of which is owned by a person, shall be treated as owned by the individual or person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For the purpose of this subpart, the Council, with the approval of the Secretary, may require a person who sells
cut flowers and greens to retailers to submit reports to the Council on annual sales by the person and on stock ownership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This decision concludes a complex evaluation process that explores alternatives which reduce or eliminate the hazard
to aviation and human safety at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFKIA) posed by the presence and activities
of gulls, especially laughing gulls. The EIS identifies the severity and nature of the hazards created by gull-aircraft
collisions at JFKIA. Until approximately the mid-1980s the hazards posed by gulls could, for the most part, be effectively
controlled by conventional bird management activities on JFKIA: insect, water, vegetation, and sanitation management
programs, and conduct of the Port Authority's bird Control Unit (BCU). Throughout the late 1980s, the hazard to aviation
grew as the presence of laughing gulls increased substantially concurrent with the growth of the laughing gull nesting
colony in Jamaica Bay. In 1991, an experimental on-airport shooting program was initiated to augment the conventional
control methods already in place at JFKIA. The shooting program was also conducted in 1992 and 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an annual shooting program is quite effective in reducing gull-aircraft strikes, especially when it is
conducted in combination with on-airport non-lethal approaches, its desirability as a long-term solution may be
limited due to the large number of gulls killed. Accordingly, the EIS process was commenced in 1992 for the purpose
of exploring alternatives to dealing effectively with the gull hazard situation at JFKIA in a way that takes into account
all interests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS explores a wide variety of alternative approaches, that would occur both on JFK and off JFK property, including:
the No Action alternative, On-Airport Shooting, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's (Port Authority)
On-Airport Program, and other alternatives that are either lethal or nonlethal. The Integrated Management Program
(IMP) includes the following components:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 29 separate alternative methods are described and analyzed. Alternatives include those that would occur
on JFK, on the Gateway National Recreation Area (GNRA), and at other off-airport sites. Both lethal and nonlethal
methods of gull hazard control are contained in those alternatives. Major categories of alternatives are as follows:
nesting habitat modifications, discouraging use of the nesting colony site through harassment, reduction of off-airport
attractants, expansion of JFKIA's on-airport bird control program, airport operational strategies, aircraft
engineering, laughing gull population reduction, and on-airport gull shooting and harassment.

Roles and Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decisions regarding the selection and conduct of alternatives are complicated by the fact that the cooperating Federal
and New York State agencies have very different roles and responsibilities. In the past, APHIS, the Federal lead agency,
has provided services (gull hazard control) to the Port Authority upon their request. APHIS' jurisdiction (and its
choice among alternatives) is limited to deciding what wildlife control activities, if any, it should conduct when
requested to assist public and private entities. On-airport gull control activities would be done at the request
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The on-airport gull shooting program, a component of the IMP, would
require the acquisition of permits from the USFWS and the DEC. The reduction of off-airport attractants would require
the approval of the entities controlling those sites. On-colony activities would require the approval of NPS. The
EIS considers all feasible alternatives, and among those alternatives, indicates which are the environmentally
preferable alternatives. However, ADC does not alone have the jurisdiction to select or implement any of those alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USFWS has permitting authorities regarding the taking of Federally-protected migratory birds, and identifies
conditions under which permits may be issued. The USFWS would evaluate permit applications for the following components
of the IMP: on-airport shooting of gulls, on-colony shooting of adult laughing gulls, and laughing gull egg/nest
destruction. The USFWS may identify conditions under which permits are issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Park Service (NPS) is responsible for managing GNRA pursuant to applicable laws, policies, and regulations.
The NPS has decision-making authority regarding conduct of IMP components that would occur on NPS lands in Jamaica
Bay. Those components of the IMP that would require authorizations from the NPS are: laughing gull nest/egg destruction,
on-colony shooting of adult laughing gulls, and display of gull models to harass gulls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEC has permitting authority for the taking of migratory birds pursuant to New York State law. The DEC has decision-making
authority regarding permitting of IMP components that would include taking of gulls: on-airport shooting of gulls,
laughing gulls nest/egg destruction, and on-colony shooting of adult laughing gulls.

The United States Department of the Interior's (USDI) recent statement of policy (Section 6.4.2 of the EIS) declares
that IMP components 1&hyph;3 must first be conducted and proven ineffective before the USDI would initiate any components
that would be conducted on NPS property and directed at relocating the Jamaica Bay laughing gull nesting colony away
from its present location. Past experience with component 1&hyph;3 activities between 1991&hyph;93 indicates
that these three components are effective in reducing bird-strikes at JFKIA.

Based on past experience, ADC determined that gulls are likely to create an extreme hazard to aviation before the close
of the required 30-day period between issuance of the Notice of Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) and the decision. Thus, ADC requested a 16-day waiver of that time period (Appendix 1) from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). EPA granted the waiver in a letter dated April 29, 1994 (Appendix 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the analysis contained in the environmental impact statement, I have determined that an integrated gull
hazard control program at JFKIA is clearly superior. I have decided, in the context of the relationship between ADC
and the Port Authority, that when ADC personnel determine, with the concurrence of the FAA and the Port Authority,
that the number of gulls entering JFKIA airspace has reached an unacceptable level, ADC will begin an on-airport gull
shooting program as described in Chapter 3 of the EIS, once the requisite Federal and New York State permits are issued
to ADC. ADC will work with the Port Authority among others to enhance JFKIA's on-airport bird control program, improve
the functioning of the Bird Hazard Task Force (BHTF), and reduce off-airport attractants. These non-lethal components
will contribute to the reduction of gull mortality over the long term, but will not be as effective in achieving that
objective as would be the relocation of the Jamaica Bay laughing gull nesting colony through conduct of IMP components
4&hyph;6. ADC believes such relocation is feasible and would be in the best interest of air travelers and the laughing
gull population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Short-Term:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 I have determined that the IMP represents the best available means of addressing the expected immediate need to reduce
the potential for large numbers of gull-aircraft collisions at JFKIA in 1994. When ADC personnel determine, with
the concurrence of the FAA and the Port Authority, that the number of gulls entering JFKIA airspace has reached an unacceptable
level, ADC will begin an on-airport gull shooting program as described in Chapter 3 of the EIS, once the requisite Federal
and New York State permits are issued to ADC. Whenever possible, ADC will continue to assist the Port Authority in implementing
and improving the nonlethal components of the IMP, including the conduct and enhancement of: On-airport vegetation,
water, insect, and sanitation management programs, improved operational functioning of the Port Authority BCU
and the BHTF, and, wherever possible, the identification and reduction of off-airport bird attractants. Conduct
of these activities will minimize the number of gulls taken in the on-airport shooting program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overriding factor that weighed in making this decision is human safety. Other considerations, including the
minimization of adverse environmental impacts have been factored into this short-term decision to the fullest extent
possible. Although I would have preferred a decision that included immediate efforts to relocate the laughing gull
colony, the current circumstances do not favor those alternatives. Based upon past experience, the timing and nature
of the gull-aircraft strike hazard will likely dictate that management action will be immediately necessary to protect
human safety; other alternatives could not be fully implemented and still address this immediate need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Long-Term: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
APHIS ADC supports the implementation of the six components of the IMP, with the long-term objective of relocating
the laughing gull colony away from its present location. For the long term, reducing the potential for gull-aircraft
collisions at JFKIA should be achieved through the IMP, with emphasis on non-lethal alternatives and on those alternatives
that would accomplish relocation of the Jamaica Bay laughing gull colony away from its present location. Conduct
of the 6-component IMP provides a more complete opportunity to strike a balance between human safety and other public
policies. The EIS adequately analyzes all alternatives, including those which APHIS and the State and Federal cooperating
agencies would authorize. Although APHIS cannot authorize or pursue the alternatives that would occur on NPS property,
it should be emphasized that the important factors of human safety and protection of wildlife can be achieved only
through implementation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
components of the IMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature and extent of APHIS' role in JFKIA's Gull Hazard Reduction Program will be examined annually by APHIS ADC,
which will report its findings to me and make them available to the public. The Port Authority's efforts to conduct
non-lethal gull control methods and USDI's progress towards the conduct of the components that would occur on NPS
property will be among the most important factors APHIS will consider. To reiterate, the environmentally preferred
long term approach is the relocation of the laughing gull colony away from its present location at the end of the runway,
in order to reduce the long term mortality of gulls, and so substantially reduce the potential for gull-aircraft collisions
at JFKIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Minimizing Environmental Harm
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary adverse environmental impact of the gull hazard reduction program is the mortality of gulls. The continued
development and conduct of the Port Authority's on-airport program that emphasizes non-lethal bird hazard control
approaches, will contribute to the reduction of gull mortality. Conduct of the three IMP components that would occur
on NPS property would reduce the need to conduct on-airport shooting programs, and would reduce over the long-term
the mortality rate of gulls. The Port Authority and the USDI are encouraged to conduct these activities in order to
reduce gull mortality in the short and long terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 7 of the FEIS identifies mitigation and monitoring strategies to be conducted to minimize the adverse impacts
of alternatives. All APHIS-conducted gull hazard control activities will be conducted in such a manner that minimizes
adverse environmental impacts and seeks to maximize human and aircraft safety at JFK. During the course of the shooting
program, APHIS ADC will monitor the situation at the airport, including mitigation strategies, and report periodically
(at least bi-weekly) to me. All such reports will be available to the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dear Mr. Sanderson: This is to advise that anticipated public safety considerations require that we seek a reduction
in the 30-day period (between notification of availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance
of records of decision) required by 40 CFR 1506.10(b) in the above-referenced matter. The 45-day comment period on
the draft environmental impact statement closed on March 28, 1994. We now anticipate that the notice of availability
of the final environmental impact statement will be published in the May 6th issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. It appears, however, that decisions may have to be made before June 5, 1994, the earliest a decision could be issued
consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental impact statement_the process for which has to date fully involved the public and included an on-site
``public information meeting''_explores alternatives to reduce the gull hazard to aircraft at John F. Kennedy International
Airport. During each of the past three years beginning in mid-May the potential for gull-aircraft interactions has
tended to increase dramatically. We reasonably expect that the potential for gull-aircraft interactions will reach
an unacceptable level before June 5, 1994. Thus, a reduction of the required 30-day period between notification of
availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance of the records of decision by the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, lead agency in the EIS process, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service,
a cooperating agency in the EIS process, is hereby requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative appeal procedures 36 CFR part 215 and 36 CFR part 217, of the Forest Service require publication
of legal notice in a newspaper of general circulation of all decisions subject to appeal. This newspaper publication
of notices of decisions is in addition to direct notice to those who have requested notice in writing and to those known
to be interested and affected by a specific decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legal notice is to identify: the decision by title and subject matter; the date of the decision; the name and title
of the official making the decision; and how to obtain copies of the decision. In addition, the notice is to state the
date the appeal period begins which is the day following publication of the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timeframe for appeal shall be based on the date of publication of the notice in the first (principal) newspaper
listed for each unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The newspapers to be used are as follows:

is to advise the Secretary of Commerce on radio frequency spectrum planning matters and means by which the effectiveness
of Federal Government frequency management may be enhanced. The Committee consists of nineteen members, fifteen
from the private sector, and four from the Federal Government, whose knowledge of telecommunications is balanced
in the functional areas of manufacturing, analysis and planning, operations, research, academia and international
negotiations.

 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has submitted proposed rule amendments to the opening price limit provisions
in its domestic stock index futures contracts. Under the proposal, each domestic stock index futures contract's
opening price limit would not be in effect on any day when the closing price of the preceding Globex trading session
is outside the price range that would be permitted under that contract's opening price limit provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The overnight Globex session in the S&amp;P 500 futures contract ends at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The following regular trading session begins at 9:30 a.m. The price limit in effect at the end of the Globex session
is 12 S&amp;P 500 points above or below the previous day's settlement price. (Twelve S&amp;P 500 points are equivalent
to about 100 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).) The opening price limit in effect at the beginning
of the regular trading session is five S&amp;P 500 points above or below the previous day's settlement price (equivalent
to about 40 points in the DJIA). This price limit remains in effect until 9:40 a.m. Thus, the price limit in the S&amp;P
500 futures contract during the preceding Globex session is wider than that in effect during the open of the following
regular trading session.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, both the current and proposed provisions in the other CME domestic stock index futures contracts are analogous
to those in the S&amp;P 500 futures contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CME proposes that the S&amp;P 500 futures contract's opening price limit not be in effect on any day that the closing
price of the preceding Globex trading session is more than five points above or below the previous day's settlement
price. According to the CME, this proposal will improve coordination between the opening and Globex price limits
on days when the closing price on Globex exceeds the opening price limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581. Copies of the proposed rule amendments can be obtained
through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254&hyph;6314. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The materials submitted by the CME in support of the proposed amendments may be available upon request pursuant to
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part 145 (1987)).
Requests for copies should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat
at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments should send such
comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20581

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. DOE established regional biomass program to promote the development of effective uses of bioenergy for energy.
The legislative authority directs U.S. DOE to ``carry out activities related to technology transfer, industry support,
resource assessment, and matching local resources to conversion technologies.'' The US DOE is seeking projects
that demonstrate bioenergy technologies which produce energy saving through displacement of non-renewable resources,
or that produce energy through the direct combustion of renewable resources. Projects will also be evaluated on their
ability to minimize environmental impacts and their ability to improve the economic viability of a specific bioenergy
industry or technology. Projects shall be located in the region consisting of the states Alaska, Washington, Oregon,
Montana and Idaho. All project sponsors will be required to provide a minimum cost sharing of 1:1. Acceptable demonstration
technologies will use one or more of the following biomass fuels: Landfill debris and landfill gas; logging residues;
agricultural crops and wastes; biomass farming; urban, forest, and forest products wood wastes; municipal solid
waste; animal wastes; and food processing wastes. Bioenergy projects can produce electricity, mechanical power,
space heat, and industrial process heat. The U.S. DOE plans to award up to 5 grants of approximately $100,000 for each
project. The U.S. DOE allocation for this program in FY 1994/95 is $450,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this effort is to provide a means of assisting the public in the utilization of a public core repository.
The goal is to assist industry with maximizing recovery from domestic oil reservoirs by providing a facility that
will preserve and make accessible a collection of irreplaceable core samples from wells in reservoirs throughout
the United States. In order for small operators to be able to economically conduct development of existing fields
and exploration for new oil resources there is a need for geologic data, including cores, from the existing fields.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 17, 1993 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare
a Joint Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) with the California State
Lands Commission (SLC) for the above proposed PGT Expansion II Project and a related project proposed by Tuscarora
Gas Transmission Company in Docket CP93&hyph;685&hyph;000 (Tuscarora Pipeline Project). The purpose of the Notice
was to request comments on environmental issues. On May 31, 1994, PGT filed an amendment to its original application.
In a June 8, 1994 response to a FERC staff data request, PGT confirmed that no expansion of its mainline facilities is
required to provide service to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis,
the important changes to the PGT Expansion II Project are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The elimination of the additional compression originally proposed at the Sandpoint, Idaho and Rosalia, Washington
Compressor Stations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The removal from the above proceedings of three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter Station in southern
Oregon; the meter runs will still be necessary to serve the Tuscarora Pipeline Project, but will now be proposed under
section 157.208(a) of the Commission's regulations (18 CFR 157.208(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The elimination of one meter station proposed in Klamath Falls, Oregon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The addition of two service taps on the Medford Extension Lateral; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Medford Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be constructed
from 84.17 miles to 86.5 miles (see Table 1)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to this amendment, the PGT Expansion II and the Tuscarora Pipeline Projects were being processed concurrently
because of the inclusion in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 of additional system compression and the meter runs
at Malin needed to deliver gas to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. However, the proposed amendment to eliminate the
compression and the proposal to build the meter runs under separate authority make the PGT Expansion II Project a stand-alone
proposal which can be considered separately from the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above changes, we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an environmental
impact statement, is the appropriate document for analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with
the PGT Expansion II Project. We are now preparing this document. Since the PGT facilities will be located outside
the State of California, the SLC will not be a cooperating agency in the preparation of this EA. We are proceeding with
a joint EIR/EIS with the SLC for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. The three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter
Station will be addressed as a related facility in that joint EIR/EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The EA Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity. The EA we are preparing will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concluded
that the project would result in significant environmental impacts, the Commission would prepare an environmental
impact statement. Otherwise a Finding of No Significant Impact would be produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to
separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Although the scoping of the original
project has already been completed, we are now asking for any additional comments only on the relocated or new portions
of the project as currently proposed. Local scoping meetings have already been conducted for the original project.
Additional scoping meetings are not anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects
under these general subject headings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Geology and paleontology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Endangered and threatened species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Visual resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Water resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Vegetation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Land use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Air quality and noise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wetland and riparian habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cultural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fish and wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Socioeconomics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Soils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the project, or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state,
and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries,
and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings.

You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should
focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal (see Table 1). You do not need to re-submit
comments if you have already done so in this proceeding. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals
(including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments,
the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly
recorded:

In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 1
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.

I. Test Data Submissions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Test data for NMP were submitted by the NMP Producers Group, on behalf of the test sponsors and pursuant to a testing
consent order at 40 CFR 799.5000. They were received by EPA on May 24, 1994. The submissions describe the subchronic
oral toxicity 28-day feeding study in rats and a repeated dose toxicity study in B6C3F1 Mice: Administration in the
diet for 4 weeks (range finding study) with NMP. This chemical is an inert, stable, polar solvent that is used in a wide
variety of processes. Its commercial uses result from its strong and frequently selective solvent power. One of the
major uses of NMP is the extraction of aromatics from lubricating oils. It is also used as a medium for polymerization
and as a solvent for finished polymer. It is the preferred solvent in a variety of chemical reactions and the manufacture
of numerous chemical intermediates and end products such as plastics, surface coatings, and pesticides. An important
new use of this chemical is as a substitute for methylene chloride in paint strippers. NMP is also used in the recovery
and purification of acetylene, olefin, and diolefins, in the removal of sulfur compounds from natural and refinery
gases, and in the dehydration of natural gas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has initiated its review and evaluation process for these data submissions. At this time, the Agency is unable
to provide any determination as to the completeness of the submissions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated June 17, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the District of Columbia, resulting from a severe winter ice storm
on January 17&hyph;21, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare
that such a major disaster exists in the District of Columbia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are authorized to provide Public Assistance in the designated area. Consistent with the requirement that Federal
assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited
to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.

Spark International Trading, Inc. v. Danzas Corporation, Nordstar Line, S.A. and Great Eastern Shipping, Inc.;
Filing of Complaint and Assignment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is given that a complaint filed by Spark International Trading, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Danzas Corporation
(``Danzas''), Nordstar Line, S.A. (``Nordstar'') and Great Eastern Shipping, Inc. (``Great Eastern'') was served
June 22, 1994. Complainant alleges that: (1) Respondents Danzas violated section 10(d)(1) of the Shipping Act 1984
(``the Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(d)(1), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by holding itself out as an ocean common carrier and an ocean freight forwarder for the transportation of Complainant's
cargo from Baltimore to St. Petersburg, Russia, failing to provide such transportation, having no intention of ever
providing such transportation, failing to use reasonable care in selecting Nordstar/Great Eastern, alleged non-vessel
operating common carriers, to arrange such transportation, failing to verify that Nordstar/Great Eastern had filed
the agreed upon rate, and failing to take necessary steps to arrange and supervise the transport and timely delivery
of complainant's cargo; and (2) Respondents Nordstar and Great Eastern violated sections 10(b)(1) and (5) and 10(d)(1)
of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(1) and (5) and (d)(1), by failing to take steps reasonably necessary to arranging
and supervising the transport and timely delivery of Complainant's cargo, holding cargo pending payment of new,
higher freight charges not shown in Nordstar's tariff, and retaliating Complainant by demanding a higher than agreed
upon rate because Complainant sought the assistance of legal counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proceeding has been assigned to the office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held,
shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given
by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include
oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there
are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions,
or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary
for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by June 22, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall
be issued by October 20, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent order prohibits, among other things, the companies from making claims about the attributes or performance
of any gasoline without first having competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate their claims. In
addition, the respondents are required to mail their credit-card customers, in certain states, a notice advising
consumers to check their owner's manual to determine the proper octane level of gasoline to purchase.

Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission
and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans.
Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed
acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.

Purpose: Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations
of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation
or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living off site of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction
of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for
DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associate
(SC&amp;A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public
involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&amp;A will discuss project progress and responses
to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions
faced by SC&amp;A's project team.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of two new animal drug applications (NADA's). One
NADA is held by Miles, Inc., and provides for use of febantel-trichlorfon paste as an equine anthelmintic and boticide.
The other NADA is held by Nutra-Blend Corp. and provides for use of a tylosin concentrate to manufacture a Type A medicated
article and Type B medicated feeds. In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the

Miles, Inc., Agriculture Division, Animal Health Products, P.O. Box 390, Shawnee Mission, KS 66201, is the sponsor
of NADA 131&hyph;412 that provides for use of Combotel/Negabot-Plus (febantel-trichlorfon) Paste in horses as
an anthelmintic and boticide. In a letter dated December 20, 1993, Miles, Inc., requested that FDA withdraw approval
of NADA 131&hyph;412 because it no longer manufactures or distributes the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nutra-Blend Corp., P.O. Box 485, Neosho, MO 64850, is the sponsor of NADA 122&hyph;158 that provides for the manufacture
of Type B medicated feeds containing 4, 5, 10, and 20 grams per pound (g/lb) of tylosin and a Type A medicated article
containing 40 g/lb of tylosin. Currently, Nutra-Blend Corp. is purchasing the 40-gram-per-pound article to manufacture
the 10-gram-per-pound feed. Because this arrangement no longer requires that Nutra-Blend Corp. hold an approved
NADA, the firm requested in its letter of December 15, 1993, that FDA withdraw approval of NADA 122&hyph;158.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is announcing the availability of the 1992 revised informal labeling guidance texts for professional and patient
labeling for estrogen drug products. The 1992 revisions reflect updated scientific information, particularly
pertaining to the relationship between estrogen replacement therapy and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Although,
the agency has distributed copies of the 1992 labeling guidance on a case-by-case basis, it is announcing its availability
now to ensure more widespread distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 21 CFR 314.70(c), a holder of an approved application for a new drug is required to submit a supplemental application
to obtain approval for the following changes, among others, in the text of professional or patient labeling: to add
or strengthen contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions, or to add or strengthen dosage and
administration instructions to increase the safe use of the product. Manufacturers and other persons can refer to
the labeling guidance texts for assistance in preparing supplemental applications to meet the labeling requirements
of 21 CFR 310.515 for estrogen drug products and 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, and 201.100 for professional labeling of prescription
drug products. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 4, 1990 (55 FR 18761), the agency announced the revocation of guideline texts of professional and patient labeling
for estrogen drug products. The agency determined that the time period to finalize and announce revised guidelines
prevented the agency from providing the most current medical information to manufacturers and others. Therefore,
in place of guidelines, the agency announced that it would provide assistance in meeting labeling requirements in
the form of informal labeling guidance texts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labeling guidance texts are informal documents. They do not bind or otherwise obligate the agency or a person referring
to them and are not formal agency opinions. The agency does not require manufacturers printing professional and patient
package inserts to follow the labeling guidance texts. Manufacturers and others are free to use an alternative or
modified approach, although they are encouraged to consult with the Division of Metabolism and Endocrine Drug Products
(address above) before drafting alternative labeling so that any differences can be resolved prior to the submission
of a supplemental application, if such an application is required under 21 CFR 314.70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may submit written comments concerning the informal labeling guidance texts to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.
Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

 is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida,
it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one family currently uses the site and surrounding suitable
habitat areas. The Applicant proposes to impact a portion of the territory of this family. Initial construction of
roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury
to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated
with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 1.35 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 3.0
acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management
endowment of $3,000 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include
siting of individual building footprints to minimize additional scrub habitat alteration, and protection of active
nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
Summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91&hyph;90 as amended), the
National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) assessing
the potential impacts of the proposed Burro Management Plan for Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA), Mohave
County, Arizona, and Clark County, Nevada. Once approved, the plan will guide the management of burros within the
NRA over the next several years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action, designated in the DEIS as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative B: Resource Based Management, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would establish burro-free areas within designated areas of the NRA and accommodate a certain amount of burro use
in other areas. Burro use would not be permitted to expand to new areas and the animals would be removed from areas where
they pose a resource threat or public safety hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four alternatives are evaluated in the DEIS, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No Action/Status Quo, No Management of Burros, Managing a Population of Burros for Perpetuity, and Total Removal
of All Burros.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on an environmental assessment prepared by Quisto Energy Corporation (Quisto) to construct, operate, and
maintain a gas well located on the Main Floodway of the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP), the United
States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (USIBWC) finds that the proposed
action to issue a license to Quisto for such works is not a major federal action that would have a significant adverse
effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Final Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508); and the
U.S. Section's Operational Procedures for Implementing Section 102 of NEPA, published in the

 September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083&hyph;44094); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that an environmental impact statement
will not be prepared for the proposed action.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The action proposed is for the USIBWC to issue a license to Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well and
install related features within Meyerhoff No. 3 Drilling Unit, Lot 271, Kelly-Pharr Subdivision, Hidalgo County,
Texas. The gas well is proposed to be located on privately owned land within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP approximately
8 kilometers (5 miles) southeast of the town of Pharr. Access to the drilling site is by way of existing county and private
roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three alternatives were considered in the Environmental Assessment (EA):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Action Alternative is for Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well in a cultivated field
within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP. This proposed action will require the USIBWC to issue a license to ensure
that such works do not cause an obstruction to flood flows within the floodway or interfere with the operation and maintenance
of the LRGFCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The No Action Alternative is for Quisto to not construct, operate, and maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway
of the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will be done within
the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will result in the denial of access to the mineral owner to rightfully owned minerals,
loss of tax revenues to the State of Texas, and result in an unrecoverable clean energy source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Directional Well Alternative is for Quisto to drill a well from outside the Main Floodway to a depth below the proposed
surface location. The directional well alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will
be done within the LRGFCP. The directional well alternative is considered not workable because of a lack of an available
surface drillsite outside the Main Floodway and technical problems associated with a bottomhole location some 610
meters (2,000 feet) or more from the surface location.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USIBWC received on June 3, 1994, from Quisto a completed Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed gas well
and related features. The EA is currently available for review and comment.

The EA finds that the proposed action for Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway
of the USIBWC LRGRCP (and the USIBWC to issue a license for such work) does not constitute a major federal action which
would cause a significant local, regional, or national adverse impact on the environment based on the following facts:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has determined that no waters of the United States including wetlands
will be impacted by the proposed gas well and related features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that federally listed endangered or threatened species
are unlikely to be adversely affected by the proposed gas well and related features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Texas Historical Commission and Department of Antiquities Protection have determined that no survey is required
and the project may proceed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The USIBWC Water Resources Investigations Division has determined that the proposed gas well and related features
will have no significant effect upon the flood carrying capacity of the Main Floodway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the Quisto EA, the USIBWC has determined that an environmental impact statement is not required for
the issuance of a license to Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well and install related features within
the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP and hereby provides notice of finding of no significant impact (FONSI). An environmental
impact statement will not be prepared unless additional information which may affect this decision is brought to
our attention within thirty (30) days of the date of this Notice. A limited number of copies of the EA and FONSI are available
to fill single copy requests at the above address.

Apache International Division of Apache Corporation Houston, TX; Negative Determination Regarding Application
for Reconsideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By an application dated May 26, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject
petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on May 18, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28428).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that Apache Corporation, the parent company, acquired another company
resulting in some of Apache International's responsibilities being transferred to the parent company's new subsidiary.
Also, the decreased sales or production requirement of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not
met. Corporate-wide sales of crude oil and natural gas at Apache International increased in 1993 compared to 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that Apache purchased another company (Hadson Energy in Perth, Australia) in 1993 and had it
not been for the addition of Hadson's sales, the workers would have met the decreased sales criterion. The petitioner
also states that jobs were shifted offshore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The findings show that Apache International has no domestic operations but is responsible for a portion of Apache
Corporation's exploration and production outside of the United States. The remaining portion of the company's international
operations are performed by the newly acquired firm_Hadson Energy Limited, headquartered in Perth, Australia.
Following the Hadson acquisition, some of Apache International's responsibilities were transferred to Hadson
Energy causing some worker separations in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings show that Apache International's operation is for the export market and as such would not form a basis
for a worker group certification. U.S. imports of crude oil would not affect Apache's sales in a foreign market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the elimination of domestic jobs because of corporate changes in the export market would not provide a basis
for a worker group certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. According,
the application is denied.

By an application dated April 18, 1994, Local #702 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested
administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was
signed on March 23, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16663).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that the workers produced electronic control equipment. The subject firm was known
as Electronic Control Systems, Inc., (ECS) until it was purchased by Control Techniques Worldwide, a British firm,
on February 14, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. After the purchase in February 1991, Control Techniques Worldwide, the
parent company, began to consolidate all of Fairmont's production to other domestic locations. The major portion
of layoffs occurred in 1991. Layoffs prior to November 16, 1992 cannot be considered under this petition since Section
223(b)(1) of the Trade Act does not permit the certification of workers prior to one year of the date of the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The union states that components and instruments from the U.K. replaced products produced at Fairmont. The union
also states that parts originally made at ECS began to be prefabricated in Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that no production at Fairmont was displaced by foreign production since Control Techniques
Worldwide purchased ECS in 1991. Some SCR power paks, however, were brought over from the U.K. but they were not sold.
The power paks from the U.K. were found to be inadequate for the U.S. market and were returned.

the application is denied.

Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Notice of Certification
Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on May 31, 1994. The notice will soon be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of some of the workers and the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the
subject firm. The investigation findings show that Western Geophysical Company purchased the Geophysical Services
Division of the Halliburton Company in January 1994 whose workers were certified for TAA under an earlier certification,
TA&hyph;W&hyph;27, 776. As a result, some of the former Halliburton workers laid off from Western Geophysical do
not have the required 26 weeks to meet their personal eligibility requirement. Accordingly, the Department is amending
the subject certification to show that Western Geophysical is a successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical
Services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29, 802 is hereby issued as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing with the Director of OTAA at the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in Washington, DC, provided

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Archives and records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at lest once monthly of certain Federal
Agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.

This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSF favors and has actively encouraged increased involvement of academic researchers and educators with industry
and with private entrepreneurial ventures. However, such involvements create an increased risk of conflict between
the private interests of individuals, or of the companies with which they are involved, and the public interest that
NSF funding should serve. These risks have aroused concern in the scientific and engineering communities, in the
public media, in Congress, and at NSF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this concern, NSF developed a proposed Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy requiring financial
disclosure by investigators and professional employees at grantee institutions who are involved in NSF-funded
research and educational activities. On July 16, 1992, NSF published its proposed Policy in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and invited public comment. 57 FR 31540 (July 16, 1992). NSF received seventy-two written comments from universities,
research institutions and various associations. The primary issues raised by commenters, and NSF's responses,
are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniform Federal Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters recommended either that the Federal Government adopt a uniform, government-wide investigator
conflicts policy with a single point of contact for conflict of interest and financial disclosure issues, or that
NSF coordinate with other agencies to ensure that agency policies are consistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSF agrees that a uniform, government-wide approach to the conflicts issue is advisable_it would eliminate the possibility
of inconsistent agency policies, and reduce the bureaucratic burdens associated with compliance with different
conflicts policies. NSF has been working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure
that this Policy and the proposed rule issued by HHS in this edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be consistent, and will impose the same obligations on grantees. In addition, NSF has been working with the Office
of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, HHS and other interested agencies to develop
and propose a common Federal policy on investigator conflicts of interest. It is expected that this policy, when completed,
will ensure consistent treatment of investigator conflicts issues at all Federal funding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Financial Disclosure to NSF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy required grant applicants to disclose to NSF the significant
financial ties their investigators have with parties whose financial interests might be affected by the work to be
funded. It also required applicants to describe the measures, if any, that would be taken to minimize the risks associated
with actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters felt that universities and research institutions, and not NSF, should have primary responsibility
for collecting and reviewing investigator financial information, and for managing conflicts. They objected to
the requirement that each grant proposal be accompanied by financial disclosures, and offered a variety of reasons
for doing so. These included privacy concerns; a belief that NSF's review of financial disclosures would be inconsistent
with an emphasis on institutional responsibility; a belief that the requirement imposed an unjustified paperwork
and staff burden on institutions; and a concern that this disclosure requirement could have a chilling effect on university-industry
collaborations and on the submission of grant proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative, some commenters suggested that NSF require institutional certifications that appropriate policies
and procedures had been implemented, and that actual or potential conflicts were resolved to the satisfaction of
the institution. NSF could then conduct periodic reviews of grantee financial disclosure/conflict of interest
records to assure itself that institutions had complied with NSF's minimum requirements. Some commenters also suggested
that financial disclosure to NSF would be appropriate if institutions are unable to satisfactorily resolve conflicts
issues that they identify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSF recognizes the fact that many institutions and investigators are concerned about the possible ramifications
of providing financial information to NSF. While NSF does not necessarily agree with all of the conclusions reached
by those institutions and investigators, the final Policy has been revised so that disclosure to NSF is not required
unless institutions find that they are unable to satisfactorily resolve a conflict issue. Instead, NSF's final Policy
requires an institutional representative to certify with each grant proposal that the required conflict of interest
policy has been implemented; that, to the best of his or her knowledge, all required financial disclosures were made;
and that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest, or, if such conflicts exist, they were, or prior to
funding of the award, they will be managed in a manner satisfactory to the institution or disclosed to NSF. Individual
investigators also must certify that each has read and understood the institution's conflict of interest policy;
to the best of his/her knowledge, all financial disclosures required by the institution's policy were made; and he/she
will comply with any conditions or restrictions imposed by the institution to manage actual or potential conflicts
of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final Policy also requires that institutions maintain records of financial disclosures, and records relating
to the management of actual and potential conflicts of interest, until three years after the later of the termination
or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving the records.
NSF may undertake periodic reviews of the records in order to assess the reliability of institutional and investigator
certifications, and to determine whether institutional safeguards do, in fact, protect the integrity of NSF-funded
research. In undertaking any such reviews, NSF will coordinate with HHS, to the extent feasible, to ensure that institutions
are not unnecessarily subjected to multi-agency reviews.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Timing of Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters questioned the proposed Policy's timing for required financial disclosures. Seven believed
the required certifications and/or disclosures should be made at the time of an award, not when the proposal is submitted,
and one suggested that institutional review take place within 90 days of submission of the grant proposal to NSF. Two
commenters believed the proposed Policy required grantee institutions to collect financial disclosures on a periodic
basis, and also prior to the submission of each grant proposal. These commenters felt the two requirements might be
inconsistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide the required certifications, institutions will have to collect all required disclosures and
resolve actual or potential conflicts prior to the time an award is funded. In addition, the final Policy requires
that, during the pendency of any NSF award, institutions either solicit financial disclosures on an annual basis
or require updates as investigators obtain new reportable financial interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Overly General and/or Ambiguous Terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters were troubled by the proposed Policy's lack of definitions for various terms, including ``entrepreneurial
venture'', ``significant financial ties'', ``significant conflict of interest'', ``routine small holdings'',
``direct relevance'', ``directly and significantly'', ``immediate family'', ``close business associate'',
``adequate enforcement mechanisms'', ``professional employee'' and ``relevant consulting arrangements''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These terms were left undefined in the proposed Policy so that institutions would be able to tailor definitions and
conflicts policies to the particular conditions existing on their campuses. This remains NSF's basic philosophy,
but the final Policy provides more guidance on the types of financial interests that must be disclosed, the types that
need not be disclosed, and the individuals who must make financial disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Contents of Institutional Conflict of Interest Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters believe institutions should establish conflict of interest policies, but that NSF should not prescribe
the details of those policies. Three suggested that NSF establish ``outcome'' or ``performance'' criteria for institutional
disclosure policies, rather than requiring disclosure of specific categories of financial interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSF agrees that institutions should have some latitude to develop policies that fit local circumstances. For this
reason, NSF's Policy requires institutions to solicit financial disclosures, but does not prohibit any particular
financial interest or mandate specific rules for managing conflicts of interest. NSF believes that its system, in
which institutions will have primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing financial disclosures, establishes
the minimum requirements necessary to protect the integrity of NSF-funded research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Required Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters agree that limited and targeted financial disclosure is a cornerstone of an effective conflict of
interest policy. However, many believe the proposed Policy required more information than was necessary to effectively
manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, and some suggested that disclosure be required only where financial
ties are directly related to NSF-supported research. Two commenters from state institutions in Connecticut believe
that their local Freedom of Information Act will essentially make these disclosures public information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSF has narrowed the Policy's disclosure requirements so that they now apply only to those individuals who are responsible
for the design, conduct or reporting of research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF.
In addition, the categories of disclosable financial interests have been limited to so that they now must relate to
research funded or proposed for funding by NSF.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Disclosure of Ties of Immediate Family and Close Business Associates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters believe the Policy should not require disclosure of the financial interests of an investigator's
immediate family, and nineteen thought it should not require disclosure of the financial interests of close business
associates. These commenters cited privacy concerns, and, for close business associates, argued that it is inappropriate
to require confidential information from these individuals, it might not be possible to elicit it in any event, and
it is too difficult to determine what constitutes a close business associate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSF's Policy is meant to ensure that institutions have enough information to determine whether conflicts exist,
and to impose appropriate safeguards. Clearly, financial interests of individuals other than the investigators
themselves can, under certain circumstances, affect the objectivity with which the investigators conduct their
research. This is particularly true where there is a close personal or business relationship between the investigator
and another individual. However, NSF recognizes that requiring financial disclosure from all such persons presents
certain difficulties and raises privacy concerns. NSF believes it reasonable to require disclosure of the relevant
financial ties of an investigator's spouse and dependent children, but the relationship between an investigator
and his or her ``close business associate'' is more attenuated. As a result, in light of concerns raised by commenters,
the final Policy does not require that their financial interests be disclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Miscellaneous Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One state institution pointed out that its institutional conflict of interest rules must be part of the state's administrative
code, and this would require new legislation. The effective date for NSF's Policy will be one year following the date
of its publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. NSF hopes that this will provide institutions with sufficient time to implement required policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters believe institutions do not have sufficient expertise to conduct the types of investigations necessary
to assure the reliability of investigator financial disclosure. NSF does not expect institutions to undertake herculean
efforts to verify the accuracy of all disclosures. However, institutional policies should include viable and reasonable
methods for enforcing those policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters asked whether NSF's Policy applies to subrecipients of grant funds. It does not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked whether the disclosure requirements apply to current financial ties, or to those which existed
over some period of time. The requirements apply to current ties, but institutions must maintain records of disclosures
until three years after the later of the termination or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution
of any government action involving the records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the disclosure requirements might conflict with consulting arrangements that prevent
investigators from disclosing the name of companies for whom they consult. In such cases, in order to receive Federal
funds, investigators would have to obtain permission to make the required disclosures, or discontinue the consulting
arrangements. Investigators who enter into consulting arrangements that prevent disclosure could seek agreements
with their institutions to maintain the confidentiality of arrangements they disclose to those institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt the guidelines for product evaluations should differ from those for basic research. NSF's Policy
allows institutions to develop differing guidelines if they believe it appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments specifically related to the proposed Policy's requirement of financial disclosure to NSF. Because
this disclosure is not required by the final Policy, these comments are not discussed individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork and Recordkeeping Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed Policy, NSF estimated that it would take each investigator listed on a grant proposal 20 minutes to
prepare the required financial disclosures. Many commenters believed this seriously underestimated the actual
paperwork burden associated with Policy, and several pointed out that it did not take into account the institutional
burden associated with reviewing the disclosures. Few commenters provided suggestions for formulating a more accurate
estimate. However, NSF has revised its estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden to take into account
changes from the proposed Policy. NSF's revised estimates are as follows:

NSF's Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy has the following primary features: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. A requirement that any NSF grantee employing more than fifty persons maintain ``an appropriate written and enforced
policy on conflict of interests''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Minimum requirements for what must be in an institution's policy. These include (a) limited and targeted financial
disclosure, (b) designation of a person(s) to review the disclosures and resolve actual or potential problems revealed,
(c) enforcement mechanisms, and (d) arrangements for informing NSF of conflicts issues that are not resolved to the
satisfaction of the institution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
b. An institutional conflict-of-interest policy should require that each investigator disclose to a responsible
representative of the institution all significant financial interests of the investigator (including those of
the investigator's spouse and dependent children) (i) that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly
affected by the research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF; or (ii) in entities whose
financial interests would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term `investigator' means the principal investigator, co-principal investigators, and any other person at
the institution who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research or educational activities funded
or proposed for funding by NSF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term `significant financial interest' means anything of monetary value, including, but not limited to, salary
or other payments for services (e.g., consulting fees or honoraria); equity interests (e.g., stocks, stock options
or other ownership interests); and intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights and royalties from
such rights). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term does not include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;salary, royalties or other remuneration from the institution; or any ownership interests in the institution,
if the institution is an applicant under the Small Business Innovation Research Program or Small Business Technology
Transfer Program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;income from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by public or nonprofit entities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;income from service on advisory committees or review panels for public or nonprofit entities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;financial interests in business enterprises or entities if the value of such interests do not exceed $5,000
or represent more than a 5% ownership interest for any one enterprise or entity when aggregated for the investigator
and the investigator's spouse and dependent children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. An institutional policy must ensure that investigators have provided all required financial disclosures at the
time the proposal is submitted to NSF. It must also require that those financial disclosures are updated during the
pendency of the award, either on an annual basis, or as new reportable significant financial interests are obtained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. An institutional policy must designate one or more persons to review financial disclosures, determine whether
an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, and determine what conditions or restrictions, if any, should
be imposed by the institution to manage, reduce or eliminate such conflict of interest. An actual or potential conflict
of interest exists when the reviewer(s) reasonably determine that a significant financial interest could affect
the design, conduct, or reporting of the research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage, reduce or eliminate actual or potential conflicts
of interest include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;public disclosure of significant financial interests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;monitoring of research by independent reviewers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;modification of the research plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;disqualification from participation in the portion of the NSF-funded research that would be affected by the
significant financial interests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;divestiture of significant financial interests; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;severance of relationships that create actual or potential conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the reviewer(s) determines that imposing conditions or restrictions would be either ineffective or inequitable,
and that the potential negative impacts that may arise from a significant financial interest are outweighed by interests
of scientific progress, technology transfer, or the public health and welfare, then the reviewer(s) may allow the
research to go forward without imposing such conditions or restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The institutional policy must include adequate enforcement mechanisms, and provide for sanctions where appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The institutional policy must include arrangements for keeping NSF appropriately informed if the institution
finds that it is unable to satisfactorily manage an actual or potential conflict of interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=4 -->
Philadelphia Electric Company
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50, to Philadelphia Electric Company, Public Service
Electric and Gas Company, Delmarva Power and Light Company, and Atlantic City Electric Company (the licensee), for
the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Unit 2, located at the licensee's site in York County, Pennsylvania.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The proposed action would grant an exemption from10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3. Section
III.D.2.(a) states, in part: ``Type B tests, except tests for air locks, shall be performed during reactor shutdown
for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Section III.D.3
states: ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater
than 2 years.'' The exemption would allow a one-time 60-day extension of the 2-year requirement. Hence, this one-time
exemption would allow the licensee to perform the testing in Sections III.0.2.(a) and III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d.3 during Unit 2's Cycle 10 refueling outage scheduled to begin no later than September 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated April 18, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BAPS, Unit 2 is utilizing a new core design which allows the intervals between reactor shutdowns for refueling to extend
the maximum allowable 2-year interval. Prior to the current operating cycle, local leak rate tests were performed
in conjunction with an operating cycle of 18 months. Use of extended cycle core designs has been recognized as a growing
trend in the industry as discussed in the staff's Generic Letter 91&hyph;04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle,'' dated April 2, 1991. The staff previously granted
the licensee license amendments to allow PBAPS, Unit 2 to perform selected surveillances on a 24-month interval (see
Amendment 169 dated August 19, 1992, and Amendment 179 dated August 2, 1993). However, the regulations cited by the
licensee in the exemption request have not been revised to reflect the use of a 24-month operating cycle. Therefore,
the licensee has requested an exemption in order to avoid a premature shutdown which would be needed to accomplish
the testing and to properly schedule the testing during the refueling outage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed the evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that this action would not significantly
increase the probability or amount of expected primary containment leakage; hence, the containment integrity would
be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information presented in the licensee's application, the proposed extended test interval would not
result in a non-detectable leakage rate in excess of the value established by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, or in any changes
to the containment structure or plant systems. Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased,
nor would the post-accident radiological releases be greater than previously determined. Neither would the proposed
exemption otherwise affect radiological plant effluents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed
action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no measurable environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternate Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the final Environmental
Statements for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1973. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff consulted with the State of Pennsylvania regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated April 18, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request
for a reclearance of an information collection. SF 3104, Application for Death Benefits (FERS), is needed for the
Office of Personnel Management to determine whether death benefits should be paid, to whom, and in what amount. SF
3104A (attached to SF 3104), requests information from the survivor which is used by OPM to determine entitlement
to a survivor annuity supplement (supplementary annuity). SF 3104B is used by the deceased employee's former employing
agency in death-in-service cases, to supply the survivor's application for death benefits (SF 3104).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately 3,546 SF 3104s are completed annually. We estimate that it takes 60 minutes to fill out the form. The
annual burden is 3,546 hours. Approximately 2,766 SF 3104Bs are completed annually. We estimate that it takes 60 minutes
to fill out the form. The annual burden is 2,766 hours. The combined total annual burden is 6,312 hours.

The Exchange proposes to amend Regulation 4 (``Order'') as follows: (1) to adopt paragraph (b) permitting two Floor

(2) to renumber the existing provisions as (a)(i)_(iii); (3) to add to the general prohibition against disorderly
conduct a proscription against acting in an indecorous manner which is disruptive to the conduct of business on the
trading floor; and (4) to adopt paragraph (a)(iv) imposing a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for each instance of abusive,
derisive or harassing treatment directed at any person while on the floor, which, in the view of two Floor Officials,
could constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange.

Regulation 4 (``Order'') is the most fundamental of the Exchange's order and decorum regulations, which are adopted
pursuant to Phlx Rule 60 (``Assessments for Breach of Regulations''). Rule 60 permits Exchange officials and Floor
Officials to assess fines, not exceeding $1,000, for violations of regulations pertaining to order, decorum, health,
safety and welfare (``order and decorum'') on the Exchange, or to refer such violations to the Exchange's Business
Conduct Committee where higher fines or other sanctions may be imposed, in accordance with Phlx Rule 960.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Rule 60 also enumerates the procedural aspects of order and decorum fines, including the ability to contest a fine
and request a hearing. The Exchange has adopted seven regulations of order and decorum pursuant to Rule 60, including
regulation 4.

Phlx Rule 960 governs disciplinary procedures at the Exchange. Rule 960 provides for, among other things, a statement
of charges, answer, hearing, decision, petition for review of decision, and sanctions, which include expulsion,
suspension, fine, censure, limitations or termination as to activities, functions, operations, or association
with a member or member organization, or any other fitting sanction.

In summary, Regulation 4 governs conduct on the trading floors of the Exchange by prohibiting disorderly conduct
and imposing fines for violations thereof. In addition to a general prohibition against disorderly behavior, specific
fines are also imposed for abuse of the paging system, possession of firearms, and various degrees of fighting, including
inciting physical abuse, minor acts of physical abuse and major acts of physical abuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, the Exchange proposes to add a new paragraph (b) Stating that any acts described in paragraph (a) which
are deemed particularly egregious, or where an individual has established a pattern or order violations, may be referred
by two Floor Officials to the Business Conduct Committee where additional fines and other sanctions may be imposed
pursuant to Phlx rule 960.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 As a result of this proposed language, similar language which currently follows the paragraph addressing physical
abuse is proposed to be deleted in order for the new paragraph to apply to all violations of Regulation 4.

The Exchange stated that two Floor Officials could not impose a fine or sanction pursuant to both Rules 60 and 960 for
the same conduct. The Exchange also stated that if a disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 960 is initiated by the
Exchange, all procedural rights contained in Rule 960 would apply. Conversation between Gerald D. O'Connell, Vice
President, Market Surveillance, Phlx, and Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, SEC, on March 25, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to adopting new paragraph (b), the proposal would also renumber the existing provisions of the regulation.
The following language in the introductory paragraph is proposed to be deleted as redundant: instances determined
by a Floor Official as violative of the ``Order'' requirement may result in fines as described below. The first paragraph
would be renumbered as (a), with the abuse of paging system, firearms and physical abuse provisions numbered (i)_(iii),
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following prohibition is proposed to be added to paragraph (a) to expand upon the general prohibition against
disorderly conduct: acting in an indecorous manner which is disruptive to the conduct of business on the trading floor.
The new language explicitly prohibits behavior that results in a disruption of trading and provides a gauge by which
a Floor Official may determine whether a certain act was disorderly (if an act caused floor traders to divert their
attention from trading, the act could be construed as disorderly).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange also proposes to adopt new paragraph (a)(iv) to prohibit instances of abusive, derisive or harassing
treatment directed at any person while on the floor, which in the view of two Floor Officials, could constitute a public
embarrassment to the Exchange, and impose a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for such violations. The Exchange believes
that because such behavior is indecorous but not disruptive to trading in each case, it warrants a separate fine between
$500 and $1,000 and direct prohibition. This provision is intended to specifically implement Exchange Rule 708 (``Acts
Detrimental to the Interest or Welfare of the Exchange'').
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, Rule 708, Commentary .01(e) prohibits misconduct on the trading floor, in violation of the Exchange's
Order and Decorum Regulations, that is repetitive, egregious of a publicly embarrassing nature to the Exchange rule
708 would specifically enable the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee to pursue formal disciplinary action for
disorderly conduct on the trading floor. The purpose of the present proposal is to provide an established procedure
by which referrals of such floor misconduct would be made to the Business Conduct Committee by Floor Officials.

(b) Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5),
in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest
by ensuring an orderly and decorous environment on the trading floor for Exchange business to be conducted. The proposal
is also consistent with Section 6(b)(6), in that Regulation 4, as amended, would continue to provide that members
of the Exchange be appropriately disciplined for violations of the rules of the Exchange.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of State announces that the Office of International Communications and Information Policy will hold
an ad hoc meeting on the future structure of the international treaty satellite organizations, INTELSAT and INMARSAT,
and the role of the U.S. government in those organizations. The meeting will be held on Thursday, July 14, 1994 at 9:00
a.m. in the Dean Acheson Auditorium at the Department of State, 2201 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20520.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States government has under consideration the issue of the future structure of the international treaty
satellite organizations in an increasingly competitive environment. The United States is interested in ensuring
the most dynamic, competitive and fair marketplace feasible for existing and prospective international satellite
service providers. The government is seeking information and data on the implications for a competitive market structure
in the event that INTELSAT and INMARSAT were either to cease being subject to existing international treaty arrangements
or if those treaty arrangements were modified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the meeting is to obtain views and information from the public and industry on what future structure
of the organizations and their governing treaty arrangements will best assure that the interests and objectives
of the U.S. and the international community are met. These interests and objectives include: U.S. economic interests,
consumer benefits and fair competition, national security interests, strategic redundancy and reliability, universal
service and maritime distress and safety services. The government is also interested in receiving comments on how
the continuation of public service functions can be ensured and whether some form of continued intergovernmental
oversight should continue. Whenever possible, comments should provide empirical evidence to support their assertions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) has initiated a review to determine if Armenia meets the designation criteria
of the GSP law and should be designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, which is provided
for in the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461&hyph;2465). The designation criteria are listed in sections
502(a), 502(b), and 502(c) of the Act. Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding the eligibility
of Armenia for designation as a GSP beneficiary. The designation criteria mandate determinations related to participation
in commodity cartels, preferential treatment provided to other developed countries, expropriation without compensation,
enforcement of arbitral awards, support of international terrorism, and protection of internationally recognized
worker rights. Other practices taken into account relate to the extent of market access for goods and services, investment
practices and protection of intellectual property rights.

 Section 3102 requires an employee who receives tips subject to Social Security and Medicare tax to compute tax due
on these tips if the employee did not report them to his or her employer. The data is used to help verify that the Social
Security and Medicare tax on tip income is correctly computed.

 Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 62 allows employees to deduct their business expenses to the extent of reimbursement
in computing Adjusted Gross Income. Expenses in excess of reimbursements are allowed as an itemized deduction. Unreimbursed
meals and entertainment are allowed to the extent of 50% of the expense. Form 2106 is used to figure these expenses.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice advises the public that Customs proposes a change of position regarding the classification of imported
articles consisting of small metal or barium ferrite magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing (sometimes
referred to as refrigerator or household magnets), under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs has ruled in the past that based on the composition of the magnet, it was classified either as an article of metal
under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading 6912, HTSUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After intensive review, Customs now believes that because composite goods consisting of magnets and a textile, plastic
or ceramic housing or shell, have the essential character of magnets, they are properly classifiable as such under
heading 8505, HTSUS. The result of this proposed change of position would be a small decrease in the rate of duty on the
subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with our current position would be revoked. Before adopting
this proposed change, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted in response to publication
of the document.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is in accordance
with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according
to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Magnets are specifically provided for in heading 8505, HTSUS. In several rulings, we have held that articles consisting
of a magnet placed within a decorative housing or shell made of plastic, ceramic, or textile (sometimes referred to
as refrigerator or household magnets), were composite goods. Classification was considered under the following
subheadings and duty rates:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 -->

*&blank;*&blank;*: [p]ermanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization:
[o]ther. *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 -->
The general, column one rate of duty is 4.9 percent ad valorem.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Because the article was a composite good consisting of metal, ceramic, textile, and/or plastic, it was prima facie
classifiable under two or more headings. Customs would then apply GRI 3(b) to determine the essential character of
the article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) constitute the Customs Cooperation
Council's official interpretation of the HTSUS. While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope
of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
T.D. 89&hyph;80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN VIII to GRI 3(b) states as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example,
be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent
material in relation to the use of the goods.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the rulings issued, Customs concluded that the magnet imparts the essential character to the article. The plastic,
textile or ceramic portion of the article merely embellished the article and acted as a decorative selling feature.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Customs precluded classification of the article under heading 8505, HTSUS, which specifically provides
for permanent magnets based upon a portion of EN 85.05. EN 85.05, page 1341, states in pertinent part as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]his heading does not cover: [e]lectro-magnets, permanent magnets or magnetic devices of this heading, when presented
with machines, apparatus, toys, games, etc., of which they are designed to form part (classified with those machines,
apparatus, etc.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon this portion of EN 85.05, we held that the magnets were designed to form part of the article. It was concluded
that because the magnets are presented with and incorporated into a textile, ceramic or plastic article (i.e., a hook,
fruit caricature or advertising slogan), they are precluded from classification in heading 8505, HTSUS. Because
the essential character of the article is the magnet, the article would then be classified based upon the composition
of the magnet as an article of metal under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading
6912, HTSUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several rulings were issued following this rationale. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HQs 082500, 083130, 083133, 083134, 089332, 089333, 089760; NYs 860370, 862523. This list may not be exhaustive.
There may be others issued by Customs in New York or in the various Customs districts under the pre-entry classification
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Change of Position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After intensive analysis, we believe that EN 85.05 has been misinterpreted. The exclusion in EN 85.05 is designed
to cover only those articles in which the magnet is merely an insignificant part of a larger article (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, kitchen cabinets with a magnet to keep the doors closed). In such cases, the magnet portion is ignored for classification
purposes, and the article (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, kitchen cabinet) is classified as if the magnet were not present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regards to articles consisting of a metal or barium ferrite magnet and a plastic, textile or ceramic shell or housing
(i.e., a hook, fruit caricature or an advertisement slogan), Customs believes that they are a composite good. Customs
will continue to apply an essential character analysis pursuant to GRI 3(b) to find the essential character of the
merchandise. If the shell or housing portion of the article merely embellishes the product and acts as a decorative
selling feature, and the essential character is imparted by the magnet, then the article is properly classifiable
in heading 8505, HTSUS, as a permanent magnet. This change in position only relates to how Customs interprets the exclusion
stated in EN 85.05.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice advises the public that Customs proposes to amend the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum
derivatives to permit first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting for exports and drawback deliveries of petroleum products
with different drawback factors which are commingled in inventory. Currently, such accounting is required on the
basis of lower-to-higher drawback factors, and is not consistent with recent changes to the Customs Regulations
in this regard or commercial accounting procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Customs proposes to revoke a published ruling and any unpublished rulings to the same effect under
which identification of merchandise and articles for drawback purposes is permitted on a higher-to-lower basis.
This change is consistent with the Customs Regulations, commercial accounting procedures, and efficient administration
and will result in revenue neutrality when drawback claimants choose to commingle merchandise or articles and to
identify them by an accounting procedure.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313), authorizes ``drawback''. Drawback is a refund or remission,
in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax, or fee. There are a number of different kinds of drawback
authorized under law, including manufacturing and same condition drawback. Under paragraph (a) of &sect;1313,
drawback is authorized when imported merchandise is used in the manufacture of articles which are exported. Under
paragraph (j)(1) of &sect;1313, drawback is authorized when imported merchandise is exported (or destroyed) in
the same condition as when it was imported, if the merchandise is not used in the U.S. Paragraphs (b) and (j)(2) of &sect;1313
respectively provide for the substitution of domestic or other merchandise for the imported merchandise in manufacturing
and same condition drawback. Paragraph (l) of &sect;1313 provides that the allowance of drawback shall be subject
to compliance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Customs Regulations pertaining to drawback are found in Part 191 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 191).
Under the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 191, Subparts B and D), manufacturers or producers of articles intended
for exportation with drawback under &sect;1313(a) or (b) must apply for and obtain approval of a drawback contract
(sometimes called a drawback ``rate'') describing the manufacturing or production operations covered and setting
forth the conditions which are to be met to obtain drawback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general requirements in the Customs Regulations for records, storage, and identification pertaining to drawback
are found in 19 CFR 191.22. Section 191.22(c) authorizes the identification for drawback purposes of commingled
lots of fungible merchandise and articles by applying first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting principles or any other
accounting procedure approved by Customs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 191.22(c) was added to the Customs Regulations in its current form when the drawback regulations (formerly
in Part 22 of the Customs Regulations) were revised in 1983 (T.D. 83&hyph;212, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 14, 1983 (48 FR 46740)). Before this revision, the corresponding provision in Part 22 of the Customs Regulations
(19 CFR 22.4(f)) permitted identification of fungible merchandise and articles commingled in storage on the basis
of the lot or lots of merchandise or articles with the lowest drawback value or allowance first, then the next-lowest,
and so on (i.e., ``lower-to-higher''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of Proposed Revision of Part 22 (published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 26, 1982 (47 FR 37563)) would have limited the accounting method for identification of merchandise and articles
commingled in storage to FIFO only (47 FR 37565, 37573). The reason given for the introduction of the FIFO accounting
procedure was that the then existing provision was difficult to administer and inconsistent with commercial accounting
techniques. Section 191.22(c) was changed to its current form when the final revision was issued as T.D. 83&hyph;212.
The change (i.e., permitting other accounting procedures in addition to FIFO) was made in response to a comment that
identification should not be limited to FIFO. Customs stated, in the T.D., that the comment was believed to have merit
and ``[t]herefore, other accounting procedures such as `low-to-high,' `identification,' and `blanket identification'
may be used.'' (``Identification'' is direct or actual identification (i.e., identification without recourse
to an accounting method such as FIFO) and ``blanket identification'' is similar to lower-to-higher.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs has issued a number of rulings on the accounting procedures which may be used to identify merchandise or articles
for drawback purposes. In a memorandum dated September 3, 1981 (File: 213253), all Regional Commissioners were directed
to permit the use of FIFO in place of lower-to-higher identification and 19 CFR 22.4(f) (requiring lower-to-higher
identification) was waived pending the promulgation of &sect;191.22(c) in the proposed revision of the Customs
Regulations pertaining to drawback. The reason given for this action was to ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;create
savings for both Customs and industry by eliminating an antiquated procedure which is not cost effective.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Customs Service Decision (C.S.D.) 79&hyph;252, Customs held that fungible merchandise commingled in storage
or manufacture could be identified on a FIFO basis for purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) (see also C.S.D.'s 79&hyph;301
and 79&hyph;448). In C.S.D. 82&hyph;35, Customs held that when fungible merchandise belonging to several persons
is commingled in storage, each person could identify for drawback purposes his withdrawals on a FIFO basis, considering
only his inputs and withdrawals. In C.S.D. 83&hyph;54, Customs held that when fungible drawback and non-drawback
products were commingled in storage, withdrawals for drawback purposes may be identified against the drawback material
in the order of its receipt into the commingled storage facility. In C.S.D. 84&hyph;82, Customs held that when fungible
drawback and non-drawback input was placed in commingled storage, withdrawals for drawback purposes could be identified
on a ``higher-to-lower'' basis against the drawback input commingled therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In C.S.D. 88&hyph;1, Customs held that the use of FIFO for drawback purposes, as provided for in the above-described
rulings, required that the products be actually commingled in the same tank and that the FIFO procedure must be applied
on a date-by-date basis, as illustrated in the ruling. (Section 484A, Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;382;
104 Stat. 629, 707; 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)), provided alternative monthly accounting procedures for certain crude petroleum
and petroleum derivative products in certain conditions. In its directive implementing this statute (Customs Directive
3740&hyph;006, March 17, 1992), Customs stated that the legal principles set forth in C.S.D. 88&hyph;1 would continue
to apply to articles not provided for in &sect;484A.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1965 (see T.D. 56487, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 25, 1965 (30 FR 12280)), Customs published a general drawback rate for substitution manufacturing drawback
under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives. General rates are manufacturing drawback
contracts describing standardized procedures (e.g., steel, provided for in T.D. 81&hyph;74, or piece goods, provided
for in T.D. 83&hyph;73). Because the procedures covered in general rates are standardized, a manufacturer or producer
who can comply with the terms and conditions of the general rate may seek application of the general rate to its operations
through a Customs regional office instead of having to apply for and obtain approval from Customs headquarters, as
is true of specific substitution manufacturing drawback contracts (see 19 CFR Part 191, Subparts D and B, respectively).
Because of its extreme complexity, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives is an
exception to this practice, requiring application to Customs headquarters for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T.D. 56487 promulgated the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives by adding it to the
Customs Regulations then pertaining to drawback (19 CFR 22.6(g&hyph;1); &sect;22.6 then contained the general
drawback rates). (When Part 22 of the Customs Regulations was revised into Part 191, the general drawback rates were
not included in the revised regulations, as not being of sufficient general applicability for such inclusion. Thereafter,
general drawback rates were published separately as T.D.'s. The general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum
derivatives, formerly in 19 CFR 22.6(g&hyph;1), was published, without substantive change, as T.D. 84&hyph;49.)
T.D. 56487 provided for a monthly period of manufacture, unless a different period was authorized. T.D. 56487 was
issued after very thorough review by the government and after the public was given an opportunity to comment (see Notice
of Proposed Rule Making, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 16, 1965 (30 FR 7756)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, the reasons given for promulgation of the general drawback rate
were to meet the complex problems of refiners who produce large groups of widely diversified petroleum products and
to provide a better basis for the proper allowance of drawback on such products, and to ensure compliance with the applicable
statutory provision (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)). Although the T.D. permitted the designation for drawback of imported crude
petroleum or petroleum derivatives used at one refinery of a refiner as the basis for the allowance of drawback on petroleum
products manufactured or produced at another refinery of the same refiner, the T.D. applied to manufacture or production
of the latter, or substitute merchandise, on a refinery-by-refinery basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A basic feature of T.D. 56487 was that refiners could, at their option, attribute to designated imported crude petroleum
or petroleum derivatives a quantity of an exported petroleum product in excess of the quantity of that petroleum product
actually produced from either the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative or the crude petroleum
or petroleum derivative that was substituted for the designated import. This feature, called ``producibility,''
permits drawback to be claimed on a given quantity of designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives
up to the quantity of an exported petroleum product which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. Under the producibility
concept, as provided for in T.D. 56487, a refiner is not required to establish that the exported articles were actually
produced from the substituted crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives; the refiner need only show that the exported
articles 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application of the producibility concept to petroleum refinery operations is illustrated in the following example,
quoted from the ruling published as T.D. 78&hyph;419.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Suppose that 100 barrels of crude petroleum are refined into 10 products in equal amounts, including 10 barrels of
motor gasoline. One half of the crude is imported duty-paid, which can be designated for drawback, and one half (50
barrels) is domestic of the same kind and quality. Only the motor gasoline is exported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production standards for petroleum, unlike those for most chemicals, are subject to variation at the election
of the refiner. In other words, the refiner could have produced 91 barrels of motor gasoline from 100 barrels of crude
[i.e. Class III], had he wanted to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To require the refiner to designate a quantity of imported crude sufficient to have produced concurrently each product
actually produced, whether or not exported, would either require him to designate more than the 50 barrels of imported
crude that was used, or to accept drawback on only 5 barrels (one-half) of the total quantity of motor gasoline exported.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, disregarding the nonexported products for the purpose of determining the quantity of imported
crude to designate, it is clear that up to 91 percent of the 50 barrels of imported crude could have been refined into
motor gasoline. Therefore, the refiner would have to designate only slightly more than 10 barrels of imported crude
to cover all of the motor gasoline exported. This is the Treasury Department position.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quantity of a given petroleum product which could have been produced from a given quantity of crude petroleum or
petroleum derivative is determined on the basis of ``Industry Standards of Potential Production on a Practical Operating
Basis.'' These standards were published in T.D. 66&hyph;16. The standards listed the quantity of 17 petroleum products
which could have been produced from four classes of crude petroleum and 12 petroleum derivatives (e.g., the producibility
percentages for class III crude petroleum for motor gasoline and aviation gasoline are 91 and 40 respectively, meaning
that 91 gallons of motor gasoline or 40 gallons of aviation gasoline could be produced from 100 gallons of class III
crude petroleum). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing procedures for the use of the concept of producibility for the refining of crude petroleum
and petroleum derivatives, T.D. 56487 divided crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives into classes for purposes
of determining same kind and quality. (In order to claim drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) on the exportation of articles
manufactured from domestic or other merchandise substituted for designated imported merchandise, the designated
imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise must be of the same kind and quality.) Four classes, based on
API gravity, were established. Crude petroleum in any one class would be considered as being of the same kind and quality
as any other crude petroleum included in the same class and any named petroleum derivative in any class would be considered
as being of the same kind and quality as the same named derivative in the same class. As stated above, under T.D. 56487,
a refiner was not required to establish that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
crude petroleum or petroleum derivative used to produce the exported article was of the same kind and quality as the
designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative; the refiner was required to establish that this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have been the case. (I.e., If a refiner used different classes of crude petroleum during a production period subject
to different standards of producibility, the refiner was required to establish only that a sufficient quantity,
taking into consideration the applicable standards of producibility, of crude petroleum of the same class as the
designated imported crude petroleum was used in the refinery during the period; not that it was actually used for the
production of exported article.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution of drawback among the products produced during a production period under T.D. 56487 is based on the relative
values of all products manufactured or produced during the production period, as of the time of separation of the products.
(The time of separation of the products is considered to be the monthly period of production.) Relative values are
stated in terms of drawback factors, which attach to each of the products manufactured or produced during the production
period. (E.g., If, under T.D. 56487, crude petroleum was used to produce 50 barrels of motor gasoline valued at $30
per barrel, 25 barrels of distillate oils valued at $20 per barrel, and 25 barrels of all other petrochemical products
valued at $80 per barrel, the drawback factors would be: motor gasoline_.75; residual oils_.5; and all other petrochemical
products_2.) The quantity of crude petroleum which may be designated for the exportation of a particular product
is determined by multiplying the quantity of the article exported by the drawback factor. (E.g., In the above example
if 10 barrels of motor gasoline were exported, 7.5 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated; if 10 barrels of
petrochemical products were exported, 20 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
T.D. 56487 emphasized the statutory requirement that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent
of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the T.D. provided
that the exportation of a given quantity of a manufactured product affords a proper basis for the allowance of drawback
only to the extent that the product could have been produced in that quantity (together with the quantities of related
products produced concurrently) from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. The T.D.
provided that this requirement meant that such concurrent production must be practicably possible by ordinary manufacturing
techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T.D. 56487 contained explicit accounting procedures for manufactured articles. When the inventory of a particular
product contained product with different drawback factors (e.g., if the inventory of motor gasoline was from more
than one month's production, each month's quantity could have a different drawback factor), withdrawals from the
inventory for exports were required to be ``[f]rom lowest [factor] on hand'', withdrawals for drawback deliveries
(i.e., for further manufacture resulting in a product on which drawback could be claimed) were required to be ``[from]
lowest on hand after exports are deducted'', and withdrawals for domestic (non-drawback) shipments were required
to be ``[f]rom earliest on hand after [withdrawals for export and drawback deliveries] are deducted.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for the above accounting procedures is explained in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, in
which it is stated, ``[t]he total amount of drawback allowable *&blank;*&blank;* shall be computed by multiplying
the quantity of product exported by the drawback factor for that product,

with due consideration for the `lower-to-higher' principle established in [19 CFR 22.4(f)]

drawback were revised in 1983, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives was not included
in the revised regulations but was subsequently published, without substantive change from its initial publication
as T.D. 56487, as T.D. 84&hyph;49) to permit the accounting for withdrawals for export and for drawback deliveries
from the inventory of a particular product containing product with different drawback factors on the basis of FIFO
or higher-to-lower. The basis for this request is stated to be that when T.D. 56487 was published, Customs permitted
such accounting only on a lower-to-higher basis but now other bases of accounting, including FIFO and higher-to-lower
are permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is Customs position that the above-described rationale for amending T.D. 84&hyph;49 to permit the accounting
on a FIFO basis in the described situation has merit (although, in the interest of administrative simplicity, Customs
believes that the order of such withdrawals should continue to be the same; i.e., first exports, then drawback deliveries,
then domestic shipments). The reasons given for the introduction of FIFO to accounting procedures for drawback still
apply; i.e., that FIFO is less difficult to administer and is consistent with commercial accounting procedures (see,
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Miller's Comprehensive GAAP Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1985), page 2401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., Inventory Pricing and Methods). The basis for requiring use of the lower-to-higher accounting procedure in this
situation was that that was the only accounting procedure permitted to be used for drawback at the time. Customs position
has now changed. Furthermore, we note that under T.D. 84&hyph;49, there are procedures guaranteeing that the total
amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise, as
required by the drawback law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is Customs position that T.D. 84&hyph;49 should not be amended to permit the accounting on a higher-to-lower
basis and, furthermore, that C.S.D. 84&hyph;82, the only published Customs ruling permitting higher-to-lower
accounting for drawback purposes, as well as any unpublished Customs rulings to the same effect, should be revoked.
As described above, when the Customs Regulations on drawback were revised in 1983 and the use of FIFO, or any other accounting
procedure approved by Customs, was authorized, the applicable provision (19 CFR 191.22(c)) was modified from that
proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for the revision. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making, only FIFO would
have been permitted. In the Final Revision it was explained that this change was in response to a comment which was found
to have merit, and therefore other accounting procedures could be used. Illustrations of these other accounting
procedures were given. The illustrative accounting procedures (``low-to-high'', ``identification'', and ``blanket
identification'') are either as conservative as the lower-to-higher procedure then permitted or consist of direct
identification without recourse to an accounting system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of the illustrative accounting procedures referred to in the Final Revision of the Customs Regulations on drawback
is either revenue neutral or favors the Government. When a drawback claimant uses an accounting system to identify
merchandise or articles for drawback purposes, it does so for its own convenience (i.e., to avoid having to physically
identify the merchandise or articles). It is Customs position that any accounting procedure authorized under 19
CFR 191.22(c) must be revenue neutral or favorable to the Government. Furthermore, it is Customs position that any
such authorized accounting procedure must be consistent with commercial accounting procedures, as is true of FIFO,
must be consistent with the accounting procedures generally used by the drawback claimant, and must be consistent
with ease of administration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental Impact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A grant under this program is categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(NEPA) in accordance with 24 CFR part 50.20(p). However, prior to an award of grant funds, HUD will perform an environmental
review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related
authorities at 24 CFR 50.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism Impact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government and, therefore, the provisions of this notice do not have ``federalism implications''
within the meaning of the Order. The notice implements a program that encourages HAs to develop a plan for addressing
the problem of drug-related crime, and makes available grants to HAs to help them carry out their plans. As such, the
program would help HAs combat serious drug-related crime problems in their developments, thereby strengthening
their role as instrumentalities of the States. In addition, further review under the Order is unnecessary, since
the notice generally tracks the statute and involves little implementing discretion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
the Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has determined that the provisions of this grant have the potential for a positive, although indirect, impact on
family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. As such, this grant is intended
to improve the quality of life of public and Indian housing development residents, including families, by reducing
the incidence of drug-related crime.

HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in

Section 103 HUD Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was
published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR Part
4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement
of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by Part 4 from
providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions,
or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this
competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR Part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.

Section 112 HUD Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's
decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically
involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action
by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule.

A. Authority and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ESG program was first established in section 101(g) of Public Law 99&hyph;500 (approved October 18, 1986, 100
Stat. 1783&hyph;242), making appropriations for FY 1987 as provided in H.R. 5313. The program was reauthorized with
amendments in the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;77, approved July 22, 1987, sections
411&hyph;417) (as amended, ``McKinney Act''). Section 832(f) of the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625,
approved November 28, 1990, 42 U.S.C. 11371&hyph;11378) (NAHA), provided for the explicit eligibility of Indian
tribes for ESG program assistance and established a set-aside allocation for Indian tribes that is equal to 1 percent
of the amounts appropriated for the ESG Program. Funding was provided for this program in the Department's appropriation
acts for fiscal years 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;507, approved November 5, 1990), 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved
October 29, 1991), and 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992). Regulations governing the Emergency
Shelter Grants (ESG) program are found at 24 CFR 576, except where superseded by statutory amendments under NAHA and
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act), as
discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance provided to Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages under this NOFA will be used to help improve the quality
of existing emergency shelters for the homeless, make available additional emergency shelters, meet the costs of
operating emergency shelters and of providing essential social services to homeless individuals, and help prevent
homelessness. The term ``emergency shelter'' is defined in 24 CFR 576.3. This ESG set-aside allocation will increase
the availability and expedite receipt of program funds to Native American communities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of ``Indian tribe.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 832(f)(1) of NAHA provides that the definition of the term ``Indian tribe'' has the same meaning given that
term in section 102(a)(17) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. An Indian tribe means any Indian tribe,
band, group, or nation, including Alaska Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos and any Alaskan Native village, of the United
States, that is considered an eligible recipient under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance
Act (25 U.S.C. 450) or was considered an eligible recipient under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972
(31 U.S.C. 6701) before repeal of that Act. Eligibility for assistance under the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act is determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Continuum of Care
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This program makes possible the first steps in a ``continuum of care'' system designed to assist homeless persons
find permanent housing and regain independent living. Outreach/assessment activities, drop-in centers, and essential
life-saving services may be funded through this program. Funds may also be used to prevent homelessness through short-term
rental assistance, legal assistance, and other services related to individuals and families remaining in their
own housing. The program facilitates the creation, improvement, and operation of emergency shelters and transitional
housing as well as the provision of services such as case management, substance abuse treatment, and job training.
For projects serving families, the projects and activities should serve the family together and work to strengthen
the family structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuum of care system consists of three basic components: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A prevention plan and outreach activities designed to bring homeless persons into a system and assess their needs;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transitional housing combined with rehabilitative services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Placement into permanent housing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Statutory Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice addresses section 832 of the NAHA (104 Stat. 4359), which contains numerous amendments to the McKinney
Act, and several amendments to the ESG program in the 1992 Act. These statutory amendments supersede applicable provisions
of the program regulations found at 24 CFR 576. The Department is publishing in this notice a description of the statutory
changes to assist Indian tribes in complying with program requirements, including the NAHA and 1992 Act amendments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Affordable Housing Act Amendments: The NAHA changes are described in the following Sections I.B (1)&hyph;(6)
of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of eligibility to Indian tribes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 832(f) of NAHA expressly extends eligibility for assistance under the ESG program to Indian tribes, and has
the effect of applying the same formula as used in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for determining
the amount of ESG funds to be set-aside for Indian tribes. The one percent figure for the Indian tribe set-aside is dictated
by sections 832(f)(3) and 913(b) of NAHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 832(b)(1) of NAHA permits recipients to use up to 5% of an ESG Program grant for administrative purposes. This
amount equals 5% of the total of amounts of ESG funds requested for all other eligible activities. Administrative
costs include: costs of accounting for the use of grant funds; preparing reports for submission to HUD or to the State;
obtaining program audits; conducting environmental reviews; coordinating program activities; and similar costs
related to administering the grant. These costs do not include the costs of carrying out other activities eligible
under the ESG program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of funds for essential services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 832(c) of NAHA increased from 20% to 30% the percentage of a grant that may be used to provide essential services.
Consistent with this amendment, the Department will apply its waiver authority in section 414(b) of the McKinney
Act to the new, higher 30% limitation. As with the previous 20% cap, the 30% limit is to be measured against the aggregate
amount of each emergency shelter grant to an Indian tribe. Section 832(f)(6) of NAHA makes the limitations on the provision
of essential services applicable to Indian tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of funds for prevention of homelessness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Homelessness prevention was added as a category of eligible activities by section 423 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless
Assistance Amendments Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;688, approved November 7, 1988), which also treated these activities
as ``essential services.'' However, section 832(d) of NAHA withdraws homelessness prevention activities from
categorization as ``essential services'', and imposes a separate limit of 30% of the aggregate amount of assistance
to any recipient, including an Indian tribe, that may be used for efforts to prevent homelessness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, under NAHA, essential services and homelessness prevention are now each subject to a 30% cap. However, unlike
the category of essential services, there is no statutory authority to permit a waiver of the cap on the amount of assistance
that may be used for homelessness prevention activities. By its express terms, the statutory waiver is available
only in the category of essential services.

Confidentiality of records for family violence services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 832(e) of NAHA requires each recipient to certify that it will develop and implement procedures to ensure
the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided family violence prevention or treatment services
with ESG Program assistance. In addition, the address or location of any ESG-assisted housing used as a family violence
shelter may not be made public without the written authorization of persons responsible for the operation of the shelter.
This new certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section III of this NOFA.

Establishes habitability standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 832(g) of NAHA requires the Secretary to prescribe the minimum standards of habitability appropriate to
ensure that emergency shelters assisted by this program are environments that provide appropriate privacy, safety,
and sanitary and other health-related conditions for homeless persons and families. A description of the Minimum
Habitability Standards and the required certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section
III of this NOFA. The Habitability Standards that have been developed under section 832(g) of NAHA to apply to emergency
shelters are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

to protect the occupants from the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

C. CHAS and NEPA Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Indian tribes are not included in NAHA's definition of ``jurisdiction'', the entity charged with submitting
a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) under section 105 of NAHA. Therefore, Indian tribes are not
required to submit a CHAS. Furthermore, Indian tribes will not be required to certify to consistency with the State's
CHAS to receive ESG funding. The Department reiterates its position stated in adopting the CHAS Interim Rule (56 FR
4484, February 4, 1991) that, given the sovereign status of Indian tribes, a State cannot be deemed the appropriate
jurisdiction to apply its housing strategy to programs administered by Indian tribes (see 56 FR 4481&hyph;82). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The assumption of environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 was authorized for certain recipients of assistance under the McKinney Act, pursuant to section
443 of the McKinney Act. Assumption of the responsibilities for the ESG program is set forth in 24 CFR 576.52, and shall
apply to Indian tribes in the same manner as described for a unit of general local government or territory. When the
tribe does not have the legal capacity to assume the environmental responsibility (see 24 CFR 58.11), the appropriate
HUD Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) Field Office will conduct the environmental review.

HUD reserves the right to negotiate reductions in the amounts requested by applicants based on the overall demand
for the funds. HUD further reserves the right to reallocate these amounts as provided in Section I.G, Ranking and Selection,
of this NOFA. Each Indian tribe must spend all of the grant amounts it was awarded within 24 months of the date of the grant
award by HUD. Any emergency shelter grant amounts that are not spent within this time period may be recaptured and added
to the following fiscal year's ESG set-aside for Indian tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
E. Eligibility and Threshold Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Applications are invited from Indian tribes for assistance under the emergency shelter grants set-aside program.
Private nonprofit organizations are not eligible to apply directly to HUD for a grant, but may receive funding from
a grantee if the grantee determines that the nonprofit has the financial and organizational capacity to carry out
the proposed activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selection process for the Indian tribe set-aside program consists of a preliminary threshold review. HUD will
review an application to determine whether: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The application is adequate in form, time, and completeness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
F. Rating Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Applications that fulfill each of the threshold review requirements described in Section I.E, Eligibility and Threshold
Requirements, of this NOFA will be rated up to 1,000 points based on the following criteria. Successful applicants
must receive points under each of the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicant capacity (300 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will award up to 300 points to an applicant that demonstrates the ability to carry out activities under its proposed
program within a reasonable time, and in a successful manner, after execution of the grant agreement by HUD. Reviewers'
knowledge of the applicant's previous experience will weigh heavily in the scoring. Documented evidence of poor
or slow performance will enter strongly into that determination. The applications that rate highest on this criterion
will show substantial experience as an organization and/or staff in past endeavors that are directly related to the
proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need (200 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will award up to 200 points to an applicant that demonstrates the existence of an unmet need for the proposed project
in the area to be served. The applicants with the highest scores on this criterion will be the ones that: (a) Clearly
define the unmet housing and essential services needs of the homeless population proposed to be served in the area
to be served by the project; (b) demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the population to be served and its needs; and (c)
set forth an outreach strategy that assures that the intended population will be served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service to homeless population (200 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will award up to 200 points to an applicant that proposes to serve that part of the Indian homeless population that
is most difficult to reach and serve, i.e., those persons having a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private
place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, sleeping accommodations for human beings. In urban areas, this is usually
referred to as living ``on the street.'' To the extent that Indians living on reservations live in such situations
(e.g., sleeping in cars, abandoned structures, out in the open), they meet the definition of living in conditions
similar to ``living on the street.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD will focus upon proposed outreach and intake plans, and, especially, the degree to which such plans would maximize
the likelihood that homeless persons would be served by the proposed project. The outreach strategy/intake procedures
to seek out and evaluate the needs of the population to be served should be clearly described in the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Appropriateness of essential services (300 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will award up to 300 points to an applicant that proposes essential services that: (a) are appropriate to the needs
of the population proposed to be served; (b) are used or coordinated with existing sources of supportive services
and networks of support in the community; and (c) help, to the degree possible, to move residents to longer term housing
situations. Applicants should describe what services are available and how they will make those services accessible
to the people they serve. In addition, HUD will evaluate the means by which the people to be served will be assisted in
moving to permanent housing that is appropriate and affordable. Applicants should describe what resources are available
to assist the population they serve to find permanent housing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications from Indian tribes within the area served by the applicable HUD Office of Native American Programs will
be assigned a rating score and placed in ranked order, based upon the rating criteria listed in Section I.F of this NOFA.
Only those applications receiving points under each of the rating criteria, and at least 500 points in total, will
be given funding consideration. In the final stage of the selection process, qualified applicants will be selected
for funding in accordance with their ranked order within each area or field office, to the extent that funds are available
within that area or field office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of a tie between applicants, the applicant with the highest total points for rating criterion (2), Need,
in Section I.F of this NOFA, will be selected. In the event of a procedural error that, when corrected, would warrant
selection of an otherwise eligible applicant under this NOFA, HUD may select that applicant when sufficient funds
become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on the availability of funds, the Department may fund qualified applications regardless of location.
If an Indian program office has insufficient funds to make awards to all of its qualified applicants, the Department
may reallocate funds to this office from any other Indian program office that has funds remaining after making awards
to all of its qualified applications.

E. Section 103 HUD Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) was published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified
as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD) (this is not
a toll-free number). The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However,
a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with
persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Field Office Counsel or Headquarters counsel for the program
to which the question pertains.

F. Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b), added by section 112 of the Reform
Act, contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance.
The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others
to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to
provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance,
if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they
are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of that part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about part 86 should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

G. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (Byrd
Amendment) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
