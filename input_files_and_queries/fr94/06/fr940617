SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is amending its practices and procedures by extending the regulatory time limits for filing initial appeals,
class action appeals, motions for attorney fees, initial appeals raising issues of prohibited discrimination,
and requests to review final decision under negotiated grievance procedures. The time limit for filing appeals with
the Federal courts, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is currently greater than that of the
Board. This change brings the Board's practices and procedures more in line with those entities and will also have
the effect of making the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This change in the Board's practices and procedures came about as a result of Executive Order 12866 of September 30,
1993, requiring agencies to ensure that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable.
The Board's review found that changing the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent
with the legal and regulatory time limits for filing with the Federal Courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission both of which can potentially review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed
change will help to eliminate possible confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board announced this change as a proposed rule at 59 FR 18764, April 20, 1994, and asked for comments. The Board received
29 comments from agency and union representatives. Twenty-two were in favor of or not opposed to the proposed amendments.
There was significantly more support for the proposed amendments than opposition. While some commenters suggested
alternatives to the proposed regulations, the Board has considered these suggestions and determined not to adopt
them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order
12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612).

The Board is amending its Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based
on Whistleblowing. This amendment extends the time limit for filing an appeal of an agency action where the appellant
first files a request for a stay of that action. This change will bring the filing time in initial whistleblower cases
into line with filing times in the Board's appellate jurisdiction cases and will also have the effect of making the
Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends part 658 of title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations which implements the Farmland Protection Policy
Act (FPPA). The amendments contained in this rule are necessary to enable the Department of Agriculture to effectively
implement the FPPA, as amended. They request reports by federal agencies, recognize the statutory authority of a

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture (the Department) implementing the Farmland Protection
Policy Act (FPPA) are contained in 7 CFR part 658. A proposed rule, setting forth several amendments to these regulations,
was published for public comment on January 14, 1987, at 52 FR 1465. The comment period closed February 27, 1987, during
which time nineteen sets of comments were received from five federal agencies; four state agencies; seven national
organizations in the agricultural, resource conservation, and planning fields; one county board of supervisors;
and two individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, as discussed below, contained six amendments to the Department's existing regulations. Of these
six amendments, three were being proposed as a result of the specific changes in the FPPA that Congress had enacted
in section 1255 of the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, 99 Stat. 1518. Another amendment to the existing
rule was to correct a clerical mistake. These four amendments, with minor changes, are made final by this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two remaining amendments, of the six included in the proposed rule, were not responses to any new direction enacted
by Congress, but were the Department's proposals to change its policy in the interpretation of FPPA provisions. These
two amendments were a departure from the policy that the Department had announced when the existing regulations were
promulgated on July 5, 1984, 49 FR 27716. The existing sections of part 658 that would be changed by these two amendments
are &sect;&sect;658.2(a) and 658.3(c). The rationale underlying the provisions of the existing regulations is
set forth in the preamble of the final rule publication, which is found at 49 FR 27716&hyph;27724. The rationale for
the proposed changes is set forth in the preamble of the proposed rule at 52 FR 1465&hyph;1468. After reviewing the
policy considerations that led to the adoption of the existing regulations in 1984, as well as considering the proposed
changes and the public comments to the proposed rule, the Department has concluded that the proposed amendments to
&sect;658.2(a) should be adopted with some additional interpretive clarification, as discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department has concluded that &sect;658.3(c) should be amended as proposed to comport with the authority
of a governor of a state to take action to enforce the provisions of the FPPA with regard to a policy or program of the affected
state for the protection of farmland.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FPPA was enacted as Subtitle I, sections 1539&hyph;1549, of Title XV of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, Public
Law 98&hyph;98, 7 U.S.C. 4201&hyph;4209. In enacting the FPPA, Congress found that the Nation's farmland was ``a
unique natural resource'' and that each year, ``a large among of the Nation's farmland'' was being ``irrevocably
converted from actual or potential agricultural use to nonagricultural use,'' in many cases as a result of action
taken or assisted by the federal government. The FPPA directs federal agencies to identify and take into account the
adverse effects of federal programs on the preservation of farmland; consider alternative actions, as appropriate,
that could lessen such adverse effects; and assure that such federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible
with state government, local government, and private programs and policies to protect farmland.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to guide the federal agencies in implementing the FPPA, section 1541(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202(a), directs
the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with other departments, agencies, independent commissions, and
other units of the federal government, to ``develop criteria for identifying the effects of Federal programs on the
conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses.'' The Department issued these criteria in its current rule implementing
the FPPA at 7 CFR 658.4 and 658.5. The FPPA also authorizes the Department to provide technical assistance to federal,
state, and local government agencies to develop programs or policies to limit the conversion of productive farmland
to nonagricultural uses, and this is covered in the current rule at 7 CFR 658.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203, requires ``each department, agency, independent commission,
or other unit of the Federal Government'' to review its laws, administrative rules, policies and procedures ``to
determine whether any provision thereof will prevent'' the federal entity ``from taking appropriate action to comply
fully'' with the FPPA, and to ``develop proposals for action to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative
activities into conformity with the purpose and policy'' of the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act does not expressly require a federal agency to modify any project solely to avoid or minimize the effects of
conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. The Act merely requires that, before taking or approving any action
that would result in conversion of farmland as defined by the FPPA, the federal agency examine the effects of that action
using the criteria which the Department of Agriculture has supplied and, if there are adverse effects, to consider
alternatives to lessen those effects. Once the agency has completed this examination, it may proceed with a project
that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As originally enacted, the FPPA contained a prohibition against the use of the Act as a basis for litigation. Section
1548 states that the FPPA ``shall not be deemed to provide a basis'' for any litigation '`challenging a Federal project,
program or other activity that may affect farmland.'' 7 U.S.C. 4209. In the 1985 amendments to the FPPA, Congress amended
this section to allow the governor of a state to bring a suit to enforce compliance with section 1542 (7 U.S.C. 4202)
and related regulations.

II. Discussion of the Existing Regulations to Implement the FPPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations were promulgated principally to enable federal agencies, with the help of the Soil Conservation
Service (SCS), to measure the adverse effects, if any, of their programs and projects on farmland. The SCS has developed
a Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, Form AD&hyph;1006, for this purpose. A federal agency considering a project
on or affecting farmland completes and submits a Form AD&hyph;1006 to a local SCS office. The SCS determines if the
proposed site or sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, i.e., farmland that is ``prime,'' ``unique,'' or of ``statewide
or local importance,'' as defined by the FPPA. If SCS determines that the site or sites are not subject to the Act, SCS
returns the form to the agency with that determination noted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if SCS determines that the FPPA applies, SCS measures the ``relative value'' of the site or sites as farmland
on a scale of 0 to 100, enters this score on the Form AD&hyph;1006 and returns the form to the federal agency. At this stage,
the agency prepares a site assessment using twelve criteria set forth in the rule. After scoring each of the criteria
and arriving at a total site assessment score, up to a maximum of 160 points, the agency adds this site assessment score
to the ``relative value'' score that was supplied by the SCS on the Form AD&hyph;1006. The higher the combined score,
the more suitable the site would be for protection as farmland. On the other hand, if a site receives a combined score
of less than 160 points, the regulation recommends that it be given only ``a minimal level of consideration for protection''
and that additional sites do not need to be evaluated as alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the primary purpose of the Department's regulations implementing the FPPA was to impart these criteria
and the guidelines for their use by agencies, the rule, in addition, established the Department's policy as to the
farmlands that are subject to the FPPA, and as to the effect that the FPPA could have on private parties and nonFederal
units of government applying for federal assistance to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the first matter, the FPPA's definition of ``prime farmland,'' excludes ``land already in or committed
to urban development or water storage.'' Section 1540(c)(1)(A), 7 U.S.C. 4201(c)(1)(A). The current regulation,
&sect;658.2(a), provides that prime farmland is ``committed to urban development or water storage'' if a local zoning
code or ordinance or current local comprehensive land use plan designated this land for commercial or industrial
use or for residential use that is not intended at the same time to protect farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the second issue, the current regulation, &sect;658.3(c), sets forth the Department's determination
that the FPPA does not authorize a federal agency to withhold assistance to a project solely because that project was
going to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1546 of the FPPA, as enacted in 1981 (99 Stat. 1343&hyph;1344), required the Secretary of Agriculture to report
to Congress on the progress made in implementing the FPPA. Only one report was required; and it was due within one year
after the date of enactment, December 22, 1981. Section 1546 provided that the report should include information
on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The effects, if any, of federal programs, authorities, and administrative activities with respect to the protection
of United States farmland; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The results of the reviews of existing policies and procedures required under section 1542(a) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As amended by section 1255 of the Food Security Act of 1985, section 1546 (7 U.S.C. 4207) now requires an annual report
due at the beginning of each calendar year. The existing regulation, which was published prior to the amendment of
section 1546, does not include any provisions for an annual report to Congress. Further, under the existing regulation,
once agencies have completed their site assessments on the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form (Form AD&hyph;1006),
they retain these forms and proceed to make their own decisions regarding the use of the site for the project in question.
They do not make a regular practice of returning the form or a copy of it to SCS. Thus, SCS receives no record of the agency's
use of the form or the agency's ultimate decision on the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the existing regulation does not require a federal agency to report regularly to the Department on the
progress made with the review of current provisions of law, administrative rules and regulations, and policies and
procedures applicable to the federal agency to determine whether any provision thereof will prevent such unit of
the federal government from taking appropriate action to comply fully with the provisions of the FPPA. This review
is required by section 1502(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now that the Act requires an annual report that includes both the effects of federal activities on the protection of
farmland and the reviews undertaken by agencies, it is necessary for the Department to modify its existing regulations.
Accordingly, the proposed rule in 1987 included two amendments to the existing regulations to enable the Department
to carry out its reporting obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these amendments would have added a new &sect;658.4(g) to request federal agencies to return a copy of
their completed Form AD&hyph;1006 to SCS after a final decision on a project has been made. This amendment received
support in comments from all nongovernmental organizations and individuals, from the State of Rhode Island Statewide
Planning Program, and from the Clarke County (Virginia) Board of Supervisors. However, the response was different
from federal and state agencies that work with Form AD&hyph;1006 and would be responsible for returning it to the SCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two federal agencies, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), and the Michigan Department of Transportation and that of Oklahoma expressed concern that this requirement
would generate additional, burdensome paperwork. The FHWA suggested that only those forms in which the selected
site had a score of more than 160 be returned to SCS. HUD proposed to advise SCS of any tracts of farmland for which financing
of housing subdivisions was being approved, but said it would be hard-pressed to return a Form AD&hyph;1006 for each
action taken by HUD, especially those involving individual mortgage insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Michigan Department of Transportation and that of Oklahoma made comments that were almost identical to one another.
On federally supported highway projects requiring environmental assessments or impact statements, the Form AD&hyph;1006
is included in such documentation and SCS receives a copy of the final document. Lesser projects, on the other hand,
do not require an environmental assessment or impact statement, because they are often categorically excluded from
review by regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These projects ``usually require only
minor amounts of right-of-way and thus have a very minimal impact on prime farmland,'' the Oklahoma Department of
Transportation stated. Both Michigan and Oklahoma objected to having to submit Form AD&hyph;1006 on these types
of projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that this change in its regulation may increase the paperwork requirement on federal public
works and other federally, assisted programs that are already burdened with reporting requirements. Congress,
however, directed that each year the Department is to report on the effects federal programs and actions are having
on farmland, and the Department believes that collecting the Form AD&hyph;1006 data generated by the affected federal
agencies is the best way to compile this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has made changes in the final rule to reduce reporting burdens. Under the current rule, SCS determines
whether the site or sites in question are of the type of farmland subject to the FPPA. Even in cases where SCS determines
the FPPA does not apply and SCS returns a Form AD&hyph;1006 to the referring agency, further tracking of agency decisionmaking
is carried out with a report back to SCS on the final decision regarding the initial referral. New procedures set forth
in &sect;658.4(g), give agencies the option of referring questions of FPPA applicability to SCS or of making these
determinations themselves, and in cases where SCS makes a negative determination, there is no further tracking of
matters in which none of the alternatives involve farmland subject to the FPPA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second amendment to the existing regulations related to the annual reporting function is a new &sect;658.7(d).
This new paragraph (d) will require each federal agency to report to the Chief of SCS the agency's progress during the
prior fiscal year in reviewing its authorities, internal rules, policies and procedures, and the agency's development
of proposals to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the FPPA, pursuant
to section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This second amendment drew a pattern of comments similar to those offered for amendment one. The organizations and
individuals who generally supported the amendments in the proposed rule were in support of this subsection. However,
three of the federal agencies that would be required to make these yearly reports to SCS were critical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposed that once an agency has demonstrated that its programs, authorities,
and administrative activities are in compliance with the FPPA, it should not be required to make an annual report.
Rather, The FmHA asserted, such an agency should be requested to report only in a year in which it either plans to change
its FPPA compliance process or undertakes a new program that may be subject to the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA commented that a single report from an agency should be sufficient until any future revisions to the FPPA or
the SCS regulations are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) asked for additional guidance concerning the type of information in the report,
and recommended that the annual report be an assessment of the progress made in implementing the FPPA, without excessive
and burdensome documentation of specific farmland conversion or protection activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has incorporated the suggestion offered by the FmHA in the final rule. Although the request for an annual
report will remain, once the agency has completed the review of its policies and procedures and revised them as needed
to comply with the Act, no additional reports are requested. In years in which the agency has changed its FPPA compliance
process, a report is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the concern expressed by the TVA, the scope of the agencies' reports to SCS under the new &sect;658.7(d) is that
which is established in section 1542 of the FPPA and which is set forth in the unchanged sections of the existing regulations,
7 CFR 658.7(a) and (b). In other words, the annual reports the agencies are to submit to SCS are to be limited to the reviews
of laws, regulations, policies, and procedures that the agencies have conducted under section 1542(a) of the FPPA
and the proposals for action, if any, that the agency has developed pursuant to section 1542(b). In addition, SCS will
be receiving data from the agencies on their individual project decisions involving farmland, but this data will
come from the various AD&hyph;1006 forms that the agencies are to return to SCS after making their action decisions.

Section 1255(b) of the Food Security Act of 1985, 99 Stat. 1518, amended section 1548 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4209, which
originally prohibited states, local governments, and private parties using the FPPA as a basis to bring actions challenging
Federal activities. Prior to the amendment, the language of section 1548 was as follows:

Accordingly, &sect;658.3(d) of the existing regulation, which is simply a restatement of section 1548 in its original
form, needs to be amended to conform with section 1548, as amended. None of the commenting parties expressed opposition
to the proposal for this change in the regulation, and it is incorporated in this rule.

When 7 CFR part 658 was published as a final rule in 1984, it was intended to include &sect;658.7(b), which simply incorporates
the provision of section 1542(b) of the Act requiring the federal agencies to develop proposals for action to bring
their programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the FPPA. However, in the draft
of the rule submitted to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, paragraph (b) was inadvertently omitted, leaving a gap between &sect;658.7(a) and &sect;658.7(c) as they appeared
in the published rule at 49 FR 27727. The proposed rule of January 14, 1987 included an amendment to restore this missing
paragraph. None of the commenting parties expressed opposition to this correction, and it is incorporated in the
final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Amendment to Change Definition of ``Prime Farmland Committed to Urban Development of Water Storage''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FPPA does not include all farmland under its protection. In section 1540(c), 7 U.S.C. 4201(c), the specific farmland
covered by the FPPA is defined. This is farmland that is either ``prime farmland,'' ``unique farmland,'' or ``farmland,
other than prime or unique farmland, that is of statewide or local importance.'' Each one of these terms is further
defined and qualified in the FPPA and, in the definition of ``prime farmland, there is an exclusion of ``land already
in or committed to urban development or water storage.'' Federal agencies are not required to consider the impact
of their projects on prime farmland that is ``already in or committed to urban development or water storage,'' even
if this land would otherwise fall within the definition of ``prime farmland.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the existing regulations, the Department adopted standards for determining if prime farmland is ``already
in urban development'' and whether land, although not ``in urban development,'' was nevertheless ``committed to
urban development.'' Under &sect;658.2(a) of the current regulation, prime farmland which had been zoned for nonagricultural
use by a state or local government with jurisdiction over the land, or which was designated in a current state or local
land use plan for nonagricultural use, is regarded as ``committed to urban development.'' This would mean that projects
on prime farmland in those areas would not have to be analyzed by agencies for their effect on prime farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department noted in the preamble to the 1984 final rule, at 49 FR 27720, that land use planning and zoning ``are prerogatives
of state and local government, not the Federal Government,'' and supplied the following rationale for the conclusion
that prime farmland under nonagricultural zoning or planning was excluded from the FPPA:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
If a federal agency were required by the Act to assess the impacts of a project on prime farmland not yet in urban development
but already designated by the state or local government for urban development through planning or zoning, the only
purpose of the requirement would be for that agency to weigh alternative sites that would lessen the impact of the project
on farmland. If the agency, based on its assessment pursuant to the Act, should then decide to refrain from building
its project on the proposed site, it would be declining itself to use the proposed site for urban development when local
or state planning or zoning had already declared urban uses to be acceptable on the site. This would be an intrusion
by the Federal Government in the function of land use planning of state and local governments.

In the proposed rule, the Department offered for public comment a proposal that would abrogate the Department's previous
interpretation of this question. In the definition of ``prime farmland,'' there would no longer be an exclusion based
solely on the designation of the land in a land use plan or zoning code or ordinance for nonagricultural uses. The proposed
rule amendment would provide that once a project site had been analyzed and given a combined score of 160 points or less,
it would be considered ``committed to urban development'' and thus no longer covered by the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the 1987 proposed rule, at 52 FR 1466&hyph;1467, cited three reasons for introducing these changes.
First, it stated that the existing definition ``is inconsistent with the definitions of prime farmland used in almost
all other State and Federal programs which use the definition.'' Second, it noted that the existing definition requires
the SCS district conservationists to review local plans and land use regulations and that many of them do not have the
background in land use planning to make the proper determinations as to whether a given project site is truly ``committed
to urban development.'' Third, because land ``committed to urban development'' is excluded in the FPPA's definition
of ``prime farmland'' but not from the FPPA's definitions of farmland that is ``unique'' or ``of statewide or local
importance,'' it is an anomaly that this type of ``prime farmland'' can be so easily and categorically put outside
the reach of the FPPA while farmland that is ``unique'' or ``of statewide or local importance'' is covered by the FPPA
despite the existence of zoning designations or land use plans that would allow urban development of such lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments on the proposed rule were sharply divided on whether the Department should change the identification
of farmland ``committed to urban development.'' The American Farmland Trust ``strongly'' supported the proposed
change, calling the existing rule ``confusing and inconsistent with the intent of the legislation.'' The Natural
Resources Defense Council (NRDC) also supported the proposed change since it did not approve of farmland being excluded
from the FPPA's coverage just because local land-use plans or zoning ordinances would allow urban development on
it. This, the NRDC stated, would be an ``arbitrary `grandfather' exclusion *&blank;*&blank;* even where there is
no current nonagricultural development and the prospect of future nonagricultural development is highly speculative.''
The American Land Resource Association agreed with the proposed change, claiming that the existing rule worked ``inadequately''
for protection of prime farmland and caused ``unnecessary confusion among Federal agencies implementing the FPPA.''
The Farmers Home Administration and the Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program supported the change. Other commenting
parties agreed with the change as part of their general support of all the amendments being proposed.

However, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and
the Michigan Department of Transportation opposed making the change in the Department's interpretation of farmland
``committed to urban development.'' In particular, HUD devoted the principal thrust of its comments to this provision,
objecting ``strongly'' to the change and outlining the importance of retaining the Department's current interpretation
that land under planning or zoning for nonagricultural use was ``committed to urban development.'' HUD stated:

This procedure ignores and undermines a local government's land use decisions made through zoning, comprehensive
planning, and subdivision regulations which are adopted to guide and direct urban development and growth *&blank;*&blank;*
By changing the definition of `farmland committed to urban development' and requiring a Farmland Conversion Impact
Rating (AD&hyph;1006) be prepared, which must result in an aggregated score of 160 points or less before it is considered
`farmland committed to urban development,' certainly qualified USDA as taking a ``big brother'' approach to local
land use plans and decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD explained that whenever an application for project assistance is submitted to HUD, it must receive approval of
local authorities. Since 1985, HUD's principal method for issuing mortgage insurance on single, family homes in
housing subdivisions has been to wait until the local government has approved the subdivision plan and construction
of the necessary streets and water and sewer systems. Under the existing rule, HUD would not have to analyze this land
as ``prime farmland'' under FPPA. HUD argued that under the proposed rule, it would be required to complete the AD&hyph;1006
form on this land, which it termed a ``useless exercise'' at that point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aside from the mechanics of the proposed amendment, HUD made these comments about the general problem of farmland
protection measures that the agency might undertake:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
In the single family housing program (which actions are most likely to be on the fringes of urban areas), preservation
of farmland would require that we would have to either be involved in the local planning and zoning process at the earliest
conceptual stages or by prohibitive and restrictive regulations which would withhold assistance for projects which
had converted farmland to nonagricultural uses. Taking either action could easily be interpreted as an indirect
way to regulate the use of private land or affect the property rights of the owners of such lands. We do not believe that
to be the intent of Congress. Putting a penalty on the land, either directly or indirectly, could result in creating
a greater housing shortage, especially for low and moderate income families who are the primary users of HUD mortgage
housing programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, likewise, objected to the proposal on the grounds that it would require preparation of a site assessment
on every project that requires rights-of-way. This would require ``an enormous amount of time and resources to be
provided by Federal, State and/or local agencies'' and in many cases there would be ``no apparent justification.''
FHWA suggested that the same exclusion of farmland ``committed to urban development'' that the Department has applied
to ``prime farmland'' should be applied to the other two categories in the FPPA, ``unique'' farmland and farmland
``of local or statewide importance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Michigan Department of Transportation had similar objections. It explained that the current rule ``screens
out many projects and constitutes a real time savings *&blank;*&blank;* If the local entities have designated the
land for other uses, it doesn't warrant a high degree of protection as resource base at the federal level.'' On the other
hand, if the rule were changed, it would require site assessments of ``each project that required rights-of-way.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule at 52 FR 1467, the zoning and land use plans that are applicable to a particular
site will be considered in conjunction with other criteria that are designed to assess the degree to which the site
is committed to urban development. In this way, the prerogatives of state and local government, as exercised in zoning
codes and land use plans, will play a role in determining whether a site should be given further FPPA review. Because
the amended regulations will neither prohibit the providing of federal assistance to convert farmland nor preclude
the conversion of farmland through non-federal means, the Department believes that the amended rule, as proposed,
will not interfere with local land use planning, and will assure that prime farmlands will, to the full extent of the
law, be given appropriate consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, sites that contain prime farmland that otherwise would have been exempted due to being
``in or committed to urban development'' would have still been covered by the FPPA if the site also contained lands
of statewide or local importance. The exclusion of lands ``in or committed to urban development'' would have limited
effect. After consideration of the comments, the Department is amending the rule to apply the exemption for farmland
``in or committed to urban development'' to all four types of farmland. It is clear from the comments provided by a number
of federal agencies that they are already applying the exemption to all four types of farmland. Section 658.2(a) is
being revised to remove the word ``prime'' before the word ``farmland,'' thereby, making the exemption apply to all
farmland.

An AD&hyph;1006 for a site that is located in urban areas need not be sent to SCS for evaluation. In addition, some agencies
would like to use available mapped information to make their determinations without sending a Form AD&hyph;1006
to SCS. To facilitate the use of such information, &sect;658.2(a) will be revised to clarify that farmland ``already
in'' urban development or water storage may be identified by an area shown as ``urbanized area'' (UA) on the Census
Bureau map, or shown as an urban tint outline or urban area map on U.S.G.S. topographical maps, or shown as urban-built-up
on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not farmland and,
therefore, are not subject to the Act. In addition, &sect;658.4(a) is being amended to clarify that federal agencies
may determine whether or not a site contains farmland as defined in &sect;658.2(a) without sending a Form AD&hyph;1006
to SCS. Where SCS is asked to complete the land evaluation portion of Form AD&hyph;1006 before the Federal agency completes
the site assessment portion, and SCS determines that the site is subject to the FPPA, then when SCS returns the form
to the agency for completion of the site assessment portion, SCS will at the same time provide the agency with the requested
information and data necessary for the Federal agency to complete and score the site assessment factor questions,
and where the agency chooses to complete the site assessment portion of the form first, SCS will cooperate in providing
timely information and data to enable the Federal agency to score the site assessment factor questions.

E. Amendment to Allow an Agency to Either Provide or Deny Assistance to a Project to Convert Farmland
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing regulations, at &sect;658.3(c), interpret the extent to which an agency can use the FPPA as a basis for
denying assistance to a project that would convert farmland. The paragraph reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or nonfederal
land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. The Act and these regulations do not provide authority
for the withholding of federal assistance to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses. In case where either a private
party or a nonfederal unit of government applies for federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural
use, the federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse
effects on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that could avoid or mitigate such
adverse effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the applicant wants
to proceed with the conversion, the federal agency may not, on the basis of the Act or these regulations, refuse to provide
the requested assistance.

The proposed rule contained an amendment that would change the Department's interpretation of the effect of the FPPA
by revising this paragraph significantly. This amendment would drop the second sentence. In the closing sentence,
instead of retaining the language that the federal agency ``may not, on the basis of the Act or these regulations, refuse
to provide the requested assistance,'' the new language would state that the agency, after doing the required analysis
and following its internal policies or procedures, would be free to deny as well as provide the assistance. See 52 FR
1467.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for this proposed change, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 52 FR 1466, is that the FPPA
leaves to the discretion of each agency ``the determination of whether the providing or the denial of Federal assistance
for farmland conversion will, in a given situation, comply with the policy and purpose of the FPPA.'' It was further
noted that the rule, as presently written, ``may be misread as a limitation on the previously described discretion
provided by Congress to Federal agencies,'' and thus the amendment was needed ``to recognize that discretion and
the general process through which it is exercised.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, when private landowners as well as state and local governments apply for assistance
for a project involving the conversion of farmland subject to the FPPA, the federal agency is required to examine the
effects of the project and alternatives but may not, based on the FPPA, refuse to provide the assistance. The amendment
in the proposed rule would avoid making this analysis a pointless exercise by removing the rigid restriction on agency
deliberations and allowing the agency to use the FPPA analysis as a basis for withholding assistance to the project
in order to achieve the policies and objectives of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of the parties who commented raised opposition to this proposal to change the existing regulation. A number of
them supported it vigorously or proposed that it be made even stronger. The FmHA suggested the rule should provide
that ``if a clear alternative exists to avoiding a proposed conversion of important farmland and the applicant for
Federal assistance is unwilling to pursue such an alternative, the Federal agency cannot provide financial assistance.''
FmHA went on to argue that if the FPPA did not impose this ``affirmative duty'' on agencies to deny assistance, ``then
other significant provisions of the Act become meaningless, such as (1) the ability of a governor to bring action in
Federal district court to enforce the requirements of the FPPA, and (2) the requirement that each Federal agency identify
and report to Congress any provisions of law, administrative rules, regulations, policies, and procedures applicable
to it which prevent it from complying fully with the FPPA. What can governors enforce, what possible legislative or
regulatory conflicts can exist, if the FPPA allows a Federal agency total discretion in deciding whether or not to
finance an unnecessary conversion of important farmland?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council, the American Land Resource Association, and the American Farmland Trust
also supported the change and, like the FmHA, proposed that it contain requirements that federal assistance be withheld
from nonagricultural development in cases where alternatives mitigating or avoiding prime farmland conversion
are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, after considering the comments, believes that the proposed rule amendment is necessary to achieve
the intent of Congress under the FPPA and, therefore, adopts that amendment in this rule. The amended &sect;658.3(c)
allows the various federal agencies to consider the particular facts relating to their proposed assistance activities
and to decide, in light of the policies of the FPPA and their own authorities, which reasonable alternative action
will best achieve their mission and comply with the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In similar deference to the agency discretion provided by the FPPA, the Department has determined not to accept the
recommendations for a complete withholding of federal assistance to convert farmland in situations where alternatives
exists to avoid or mitigate the effects of conversion. There may be, specific situations, compelling reasons of national,
state, or local importance that would outweigh the protective policies of the Act. The federal agencies, in exercising
the responsibility provided by the FPPA, can best analyze the facts of those situations, and their discretion to do
so should not be unnecessarily constrained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the Congress, during deliberations on proposed amendments to the FPPA as part of the Food
Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, considered and rejected a ban on federal assistance to convert farmland
in situations where reasonable alternatives to conversion exist. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 447, 99th Cong., 1st Sess.
472 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2398. The final rule allows the intentions of Congress,
as expressed in the FPPA and in the 1985 deliberations, to be carried out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During consideration of the comments received on the proposed rule and in interagency discussions within the Department,
a misunderstanding of the scope of the analysis required by the FPPA and the regulations surfaced. This related to
the extent to which federal agencies are required to identify and assess the potential for future conversion of farmland
as a result of present activities and assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with other natural resource or environmental evaluations, such as the analyses required by the National Environmental
Policy Act, the scope of the review must be related to the scope of the activity under consideration. In complying with
the requirements of section 1542 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 4203) that each federal agency review its programs, authorities,
policies, and procedures and take appropriate measures to assure that they conform with the purposes of the FPPA,
an agency may properly consider the broader implications that its programs and policies have toward the potential
for future conversions of farmland to nonagricultural uses. However, in considering whether a specific project
or assistance activity of the agency will result in the irreversible conversion of farmland, the focus will be on those
direct and indirect effects of the activity that can be reasonably identified and evaluated. In a review of a specific
activity which does not contain proposals for, nor necessarily lead to, future activities that may convert farmland,
the potential activities may be too general or speculative to adequately identify and usefully consider. The scope
of each evaluation is determined by the scope of the objectives and facts of the agency activity under consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that the guidance provided in &sect;658.3(c), as amended by this rule, regarding the providing
of federal assistance to convert farmland clearly applies beyond situations where a federal agency has been requested
to provide assistance. Federal activities that are the result of federal initiatives, rather than requests for federal
assistance, necessarily involve the same farmland protection policy considerations. In a situation where a Federal
agency is contemplating an action that would convert farmland to a nonagricultural use and which is not the result
of a direct request for federal assistance, the federal agency may decide, after conducting the analysis required
by the FPPA, not to proceed with the action in order to achieve the objectives of the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the policy objectives of the FPPA in the manner discussed above and as contained in this final rule
not only respects the traditional deference to state and local land use decisionmaking reflected in the FPPA, but
also comports with and furthers the principles of federalism contained in Executive Order No. 12612 of October 26,
1987, 52 FR 41685. Local zoning and land use plans will be considered in determining if a site has been committed to urban
development. Further, a federal agency may support state and local efforts to protect farmland by deciding not to
provide federal assistance that would be used to convert farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wording of &sect;658.3(c) has been slightly modified from that of the proposed rule to clarify that any agency
policies or procedures for implementing the Act may be considered by an agency in deciding how to proceed with an activity.

F. Additional Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some federal agencies raised concerns as to actions subject to the Act. The current regulation, at &sect;658.2(c),
provides an exemption for federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs. Federal regulatory activities
are not considered as federal assistance that could convert farmland. Therefore, federal regulatory activities
are exempted from the Act. For example, in cases where a Clean Water Act section 404 permittee is required by the Corps
of Engineers to perform compensatory mitigation on farmed wetland, thereby converting the wetland actual or potential
use of farmland to a nonagricultural use, that conversion is not subject to FPPA. In complying with &sect;658.7 (a)
and (b), Federal agencies may identify those programs that they determine are not subject to the Act and provide details
on how other programs will be implemented consistent with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As further clarification, it should be noted that only those actions that will or could convert farmland to nonagricultural
uses are subject to the Act. Assistance provided to purchase, maintain, renovate, or replace a structure that already
exists is not subject to the Act, because any conversion of farmland took place at the time the structure was constructed.
The addition of minor new ancillary structures, such as garages or sheds, to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
serve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
existing structures is also not included under the Act. Even in cases where loans are made for new houses, that action
is not subject to the FPPA if the request for assistance and commitment by the federal agency was made after the house
was constructed. Likewise, once one Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA for the conversion of
a site, that agency's or a second Federal agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions
on the same site do not require additional, redundant FPPA analysis. Section 658.4(h) is being added to the final rule
to reflect this clarification.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several federal agencies cited concern for the application of the FPPA to land acquisitions by these agencies, providing
temporary, intermediate ownership by the Federal Government such as through foreclosure, the acquisition of assets
of an insolvent thrift institution or through forfeiture in criminal law enforcement proceedings. They expressed
concern for potential conflicts between their statutory responsibilities to obtain prompt, high value disposal
of these assets and the analysis procedures required under the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Federal program'' in the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4201(c)(4), extends the coverage of the FPPA to ``acquiring,
managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities.'' If an agency determines that its program does not result
in a sufficient acquisition of legal or equitable title by the United States to characterize the property as ``Federal
land or facilities,'' then the agency may exclude such land through its own policies and procedures for implementing
the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department has determined that an interpretive clarification of the term ``Federal land and facilities''
as used in the definition of ``Federal programs'' covered by the FPPA would be useful. In that regard, the Department
believes that the use of the word ``Federal'' to modify the words ``land and facilities'' indicates an intent by Congress
to focus the scope of federal programs covered by the FPPA to lands and facilities acquired or managed by federal agencies
as necessary proprietary elements of federal programs, such as national forests, national parks, or military bases.
The use of the modifier ``Federal'' is significant; if the intent was to include the acquisition, management, or disposal
of any land or facility by a federal agency, regardless of the purpose of the use of the land or facility, Congress could
have omitted the modifier and simply stated, ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of lands and facilities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department has amended the definition of ``Federal program'' contained in &sect;658.2(c) to clarify
that, for the purposes of the FPPA and these regulations, the phrase ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of federal
lands and facilities'' refers to lands and facilities that are acquired, managed, or were used by a federal agency
specifically in support of a federal activity or program. It does not include lands or facilities that are acquired,
managed, or disposed of by a federal agency as the incidental result of actions by that agency through which the agency
has temporary ownership or custody of the land or facility, such as acquisition pursuant to a lien for delinquent taxes,
the exercise of conservationship or receivership authority, or the exercise of civil or criminal law enforcement
forfeiture or seizure authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has also incorporated in the definition of ``Federal program'' interpretive clarification that
loan guarantees or loan insurance of the construction of buildings or other structures is covered by the phrase ``undertaking,
financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects'' contained in the definition of ``Federal program.''
This interpretation was previously provided in the preamble of the final rule that promulgated the current regulations.
See 49 FR 27720, July 5, 1984. Further in this regard, the Department has clarified that the acquisition, management,
and disposal of land or facilities that a federal agency obtains as the result of foreclosure or other actions taken
under a loan, loan guarantee, or other financial assistance proved by the agency directly and specifically for that
property or facility is likewise within the definition of ``Federal program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A federal agency may develop and use procedures to implement the FPPA for its loan, loan guarantee, or other financial
assistance programs on either a specific project/loan basis or on the basis of an entire program. Further, if an agency
has conducted a FPPA review of a loan or other financial assistance for the conversion of farmland and the agency or
any other federal agency subsequently acquires the property related to that assistance, the previously conducted
FPPA review will be sufficient to constitute compliance with the FPPA for the management an eventual disposal of the
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More importantly, an agency may develop and use specific policies and procedures for the management and disposal
of property acquired through foreclosure, forfeiture, or other such means that taken into consideration its primary
statutory authorities regarding such properties. Clearly, these determinations can be best made by the particular
agencies involved through their respective FPPA policies and procedures, in consideration of the statutory requirements
under which they operate. The Department will consult with agencies, pursuant to section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C.
4203, to address these concerns.

Some federal agencies would like to exempt certain sites related to the expansion of existing linear projects that
would convert only a few acres of farmland but would avoid the conversion of a large number of acres. Some statewide
LESA systems currently include exemptions of 10 acres per bridge and 3 acres per mile on existing highways. The construction
of bridges and widening of existing highways is a farmland protection method. USDA will consult with Federal Highway
Administration, on actions that are designed to improve existing linear projects so as to avoid the conversion of
land that would occur if a new linear project were to be constructed.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Farmland
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means prime or unique farmlands as defined in section 1540(c)(1) of the Act or farmland that is determined by the appropriate
state or unit of local government agency or agencies with concurrence of the Secretary to be farmland of statewide
of local importance. ``Farmland'' does not include land already in or committed to urban development or water storage.
Farmland ``already in'' urban development or water storage includes all such land with a density of 30 structures
per 40-acre area. Farmland already in urban development also includes lands identified as ``urbanized area'' (UA)
on the Census Bureau Map, or as urban area mapped with a ``tint overprint'' on the USGS topographical maps, or as ``urban-built-up''
on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not ``farmland''
and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. Farmland ``committed to urban development or water storage'' includes
all such land that receives a combined score of 160 points or less from the land evaluation and site assessment criteria.

Federal program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means those activities or responsibilities of a Federal agency that involve undertaking, financing, or assisting
construction or improvement projects or acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The term ``Federal program'' does not include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs for activities on private or non-Federal lands; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) construction or improvement projects that were beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design
or construction state on August 4, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the purposes of this section, a project is considered to be ``beyond the planning stage and in either the active
design or construction state on August 4, 1984'' if, on or before that date, actual construction of the project had
commenced or:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) acquisition of land or easements for the project had occurred or all required Federal agency planning documents
and steps were completed and accepted, endorsed, or approved by the appropriate agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) a final environmental impact statement was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency or an environmental
assessment was completed and a finding of no significant impact was executed by the appropriate agency official;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the engineering or architectural design had begun or such services had been secured by contract. The phrase
``undertaking, financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects'' includes providing loan guarantees
or loan insurance for such projects and includes the acquisition, management and disposal of land or facilities that
a Federal agency obtains as the result of foreclosure or other actions taken under a loan or other financial assistance
provided by the agency directly and specifically for that property. For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``acquiring,
managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities'' refers to lands and facilities that are acquired, managed,
or used by a Federal agency specifically in support of a Federal activity or program, such as national parks, national
forests, or military bases, and does not refer to lands and facilities that are acquired by a Federal agency as the incidental
result of actions by the agency that give the agency temporary custody or ownership of the lands or facilities, such
as acquisition pursuant to a lien for delinquent taxes, the exercise of conservatorship or receivership authority,
or the exercise of civil or criminal law enforcement forfeiture or seizure authority.

(c) The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or
nonfederal land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. In cases where either a private party
or a nonfederal unit of government applies for federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural use, the
federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse effects
on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that would avoid or mitigate such adverse
effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the landowners want to proceed
with conversion, the federal agency, on the basis of the analysis set forth in &sect;658.4 and any agency policies
or procedures for implementing the Act, may provide or deny the requested assistance. Only assistance and actions
that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses are subject to this Act. Assistance and actions related to the
purchase, maintenance, renovation, or replacement of existing structures and sites converted prior to the time
of an application for assistance from a federal agency, including assistance and actions related to the construction
of minor new ancillary structures (such as garages or sheds), are not subject to the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 1548 of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 4209, states that the Act shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any
action, either legal or equitable, by any person or class of persons challenging a federal project, program, or other
activity that may affect farmland. Neither the Act nor this rule, therefore, shall afford any basis for such an action.
However, as further provided in section 1548, the governor of an affected state, where a state policy or program exists
to protect farmland, may bring an action in the federal district court of the district where a federal program is proposed
to enforce the requirements of section 1541 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202, and regulations issued pursuant to that section.

(a) An agency may determine whether or not a site is farmland as defined in &sect;658.2(a) or the agency may request
that SCS make such a determination. If an agency elects not to make its own determination, it should make a request to
SCS on Form AD&hyph;1006, the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, available at SCS offices, for determination
of whether the site is farmland subject to the Act. If neither the entire site nor any part of it are subject to the Act,
then the Act will not apply and SCS will so notify the agency. If the site is determined by SCS to be subject to the Act,
then SCS will measure the relative value of the site as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the information sources
listed in &sect;658.5(a). SCS will respond to these requests within 10 working days of their receipt except that in
cases where a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, SCS will respond in 30 working days. In the event
that SCS fails to complete its response within the required period, if further delay would interfere with construction
activities, the agency should proceed as though the site were not farmland.

each Federal agency is requested to report to the Chief of the Soil Conservation Service by November 15th of each year
on progress made during the prior fiscal year to implement sections 1542 (a) and (b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203 (a) and
(b). Until an agency fully implements those sections, the agency should continue to make the annual report, but may
omit the report upon full implementation. However, an agency is requested to file an annual report for any future year
in which the agency has substantially changed its process for compliance with the Act.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines
and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000.
A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended that the pack requirements for volume-filled containers
of California nectarines be revised, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended that the pack requirements
for volume-filled containers of California peaches be revised. These committees meet prior to and during each season
to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the
orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings.
The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and
determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

Section 916.350 (7 CFR 916.350, as amended at 59 FR 15838) specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine
shipments. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 specifies that nectarines in any closed package or container, except
master containers of consumer packages and individual consumer packages, shall be packed in accordance with ``standard
pack''. ``Standard pack'' is defined in paragraph (b) of &sect;916.350 as having the same meaning as set forth in the
United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines (7 CFR 51.3145 through 51.3160). Under the definition of ``standard
pack'', nectarines packed in certain containers must be tightly packed and the containers must be ``well filled''.
``Well filled'' means that the container is properly filled, allowing no movement of its contents, and the container
should have its contents in firm contact with the cover. This rule revises &sect;916.350 by adding a new proviso to
paragraph (a)(1) specifying that the nectarines in any such container need only be filled to within one inch of the
top of the container. This rule also removes the proviso in paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 reading ``That nectarines
in any container shall be fairly uniform in size'', because such requirements are included within the definition
of ``standard pack'' in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines, and therefore are not needed in this
paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 917.442 (7 CFR 917.442, as amended at 59 FR 15840) specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach
shipments. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.442 specifies that peaches in any closed package or container, except
master containers of consumer packages and individual consumer packages, shall be packed in certain containers
in accordance with ``standard pack''. ``Standard pack'' is defined in paragraph (b) of &sect;917.442 as having the
same meaning as set forth in the United States Standards for Grades of Peaches (7 CFR 51.1210 through 51.1223). Under
the definition of ``standard pack'', peaches in certain containers must be tightly packed and the containers must
be ``well filled''. ``Well filled'' means that the level of the fruit must be slightly higher than the top edge of the
container and the peaches are held firmly in place. This rule revises &sect;917.442 by adding a new proviso to paragraph
(a)(1) specifying that the peaches in any such container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC and PCC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers
after a comprehensive review of changes in the nectarine and peach industry packing practices over the years, and
the need to make appropriate changes in the pack requirements. When the pack requirements were established, most
containers were of a place-pack or a tray-pack type, but at the present time substantial quantities of nectarines
and peaches are shipped in volume-filled containers throughout the entire range of sizes packed. This revision will
provide handlers with more flexibility in selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled packs
without potential bruise damage to the fruit. Under current packing conditions, nectarines and peaches of certain
varieties and sizes are sometimes bruised when packed in accordance with ``standard pack'', because the fruit extends
above the top of the container and is damaged when the lid is attached. There are a combination of factors contributing
to this situation, including: (1) Handlers must pack a specific quantity of fruit, in terms of minimum weight, in certain
containers, and some handlers prefer to pack precisely this quantity in each such container; (2) the volume of fruit
packed in a particular container varies depending on the variety and size of fruit for a given pack weight; (3) handlers
maintain a limited number of different size containers in inventory; and (4) handlers pack most of their fruit at the
well matured stage of maturity, and such fruit is susceptible to bruising when packed too tight. This revision will
enable handlers to pack their nectarines and peaches with up to one inch space between the top of the fruit and the top
of the container, and result in less bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the pack requirements for
California nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers, as specified. The Department's determination
is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and
peaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule revises pack requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers, enabling
handlers to pack such fruit consistent with desirable packing practices, and is needed to help the California nectarine
and peach industries maintain the quality of fruit shipped to the fresh market. This rule is designed to establish
and maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) Shipment of the 1994 season crop of fresh California nectarines and peaches is currently underway; (2)
this rule relaxes pack requirements for both nectarines and peaches; (3) California nectarine and peach handlers
are aware of these revised pack requirements recommended by the committees at public meetings, and they will need
no additional time to comply with such requirements; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any written
comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule for 7 CFR 1755.525 was first published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a 7 CFR part 1762 proposed rule on October 29, 1989, at 54 FR 43429. Since that time part 1762 has been incorporated
into part 1755. Due to the pertinence of the comments received REA decided to incorporate many of them into the document.
The revised rule was published as a 7 CFR part 1755 proposed rule on March 14, 1991, at 56 FR 10827 with a 60 day comment
period. During this period comments and suggestions were received from six major manufacturers of central office
equipment. Many useful comments and suggestions were received and many of them have been incorporated into the revised
Form 525 Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last revision to the Form 525 Contract was September 1966. Since that date, significant changes have been made
in the telephone industry. The profound advancement in central office equipment technology has made possible many
new services on a cost effective basis. Divestiture and competition, legislation and regulation have brought about
many changes in the conduct of telecommunications business. The revised Form 525 Contract incorporates these changes
into the Central Office Equipment Contract. The main changes to the Contract are new requirements that: (1) Provide
for a software license, (2) provide for patent, copyright, and trademark infringement protection, (3) provide a
cap on consequential damages, and (4) provide Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. In addition, it revises
and updates provisions for (1) delivery and installation of equipment, (2) inspection and testing of the completed
installations, (3) payments to the contractor, (4) insurance, (5) liquidated damages, and (6) completion of the
project. This action will make it possible for REA telephone borrowers to continue to provide their subscribers with
the most modern and efficient telephone service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA has issued a series of 7 CFR chapter XVII parts which serve to implement the policies, procedures, and requirements
for administering its loan and loan guarantee programs and the loan documents and security instruments which provide
for and secure REA financing. The technical change to 7 CFR part 1753 updates the number of days allowed for acceptance
testing in order to conform with REA Form 525 Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation). The revision
to 7 CFR part 1755 codifies REA Form 525, Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation). The 7 CFR part
1755 also describes where copies of the contract may be obtained. REA telephone borrowers are required to use the REA
Form 525 Contract where major central office facilities are being procured and installed under contract. The present
REA Form 525 has become outdated due to technological advancements and other reasons. Advanced technology and equipment
concepts have introduced new issues. Contract terms and obligations need to be modified and updated to more accurately
reflect present business practices. Some representative issues addressed in updating this contract are: Expansion

Public comments were received from Alcatel Network Systems, Inc., AT&amp;T Network Systems, Mitel Public Switching,
Northern Telecom Inc., Redcom Laboratories, Inc., and Seimens Stromberg-Carlson. The comments, recommendations
and responses are summarized as follows:

General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that a telephone central office switch is a computer and should be purchased using a supply
type contract rather than a construction contract and therefore, REA Form 525 should not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels that due to the very complex nature and individuality of each central office and the immense amount of coordination
and development that must be done prior to, during, and after the installation a supply type contract would not be a
suitable instrument to achieve the desired results. Further, REA feels a supply type contract does not provide the
Borrower the same degree of protection as the REA Form 525 Contract. This lack of protection could be devastating to
the Borrower and consequently, jeopardize REA loan security. The required use of REA Form 525, Central Office Equipment
Contract (Including Installation), remains.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Item 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the Owner should be responsible for providing a notice that the state requires a license
for bidding, if such a requirement exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Bidder is the party who ultimately will have to abide by the State's licensing requirements, REA believes
the Bidder should bear the responsibility for determining whether a license is required for bidding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Item 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the method of bidding in the existing REA Form 525 makes bid bonds optional and the proposed
REA Form 525 removes this option. They feel that the option should remain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing REA Form 525, Notice and Instructions to Bidders, Item 5, and the proposed REA Form 525, Notice and Instructions
to Bidders, Item 6, specifically state that each proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond or a certified check. No
other option exists. The wording in both documents is essentially the same.

Item 14: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) One commenter remarked that this requirement adds complexity and administrative burden because the manufacturers
are already required to comply with REA Form 525, Article VI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Item 14(b) is required by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) requirement.

Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters questioned the use of the term ``Delivery Acceptance'' in column five of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Column five is the time in calendar days between approval of the Contract and delivery of equipment. The term ``Acceptance''
has been removed from this column to more clearly define the requirement.

Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that there should be some instruction as to how to identify each project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA agrees. REA has added Note 3 to Article I, section 1, as an instruction to leave a blank line between each Project
listed in section 1.

Section 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the word ``substantial'' should be replaced and one commenter remarked that the language
``The Owner *&blank;*&blank;* may *&blank;*&blank;* make reasonable changes, additions to or subtractions from
the Specifications *&blank;*&blank;*'' is ambiguous and should be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is the same language that is in the existing REA Form 525 Contract. It has worked well in the past and REA does not
feel there is a need to change it.

Article II, Delivery and Installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the draft REA Form 525 made the Completion of Installation of the essence. The commenter
feels that Completion of the Project should be of the essence, since liquidated damages are measured from that event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Completion of Installation is a scheduled date that must be met. The scheduled date for the Completion of the Project,
as shown in Article I, Section 1, Column 7, is established by adding 60 days to the Completion of Installation. Liquidated
Damages are measured from the scheduled date for Completion of the Project. Actual Completion of the Project may be
a date earlier or later than the scheduled date of Completion of the Project as defined in Article VII, Section 1, Definitions.
Therefore, REA believes that Completion of Installation must be of the essence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that if a remote switching terminal is scheduled independently of a central office, the Contract
should reflect this as a separate Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article I, Section 1, and the Contract in general, regard a central office, including all associated remote switching
terminals, to be an indivisible unit for delivery, payment, turnover, closeout, liquidated damages, and other purposes.
A host office and its remotes are interdependent and alterations to one may affect the others. Therefore, REA regards
a host office and all associated remotes as one item under the Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the reference to ``the satisfaction of the Owner and the Administrator'' is a subjective
standard and should be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the language in question is deleted, the Section would require unconditional adherence to the terms of the Contract.
The language is included here to allow the possibility of latitude, where the Owner and REA agree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter had the following remarks: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the first sentence the wording ``give sufficient supervision to'' should be changed to ``supervise.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Also, this commenter feels the language ``using Bidder's best skill and attention'' is onus and unenforceable
and should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The commenter also feels the second sentence should be expanded to include the following language ``but that
the failure of the Bidder to discover these items shall not create any obligation or liability on the part of the Bidder,
nor relieve the Owner of its performance or responsibilities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels that the existing language is appropriate. REA disagrees with the expansion of the second sentence since
REA believes it is reasonable for the Bidder to be responsible for the fulfillment of the Contract requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter had the following remarks: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The reference to ``manufacturing'' in the first paragraph should be replaced with ``other than cost information
or any other information from which cost could be derived.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The commenter also suggests the language ``each central office (and its associated remote switching terminals),
feature or service'' be replaced with the word ``Project'' as a potential exists for a remote to be scheduled as a separate
Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In addition, the commenter feels the word ``nonperformance'' in the fourth paragraph should be replaced with
``failure to satisfactorily resolve all such deficiencies as previously listed on the REA Form 517.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) REA feels the language in the first paragraph offers sufficient protection to the Bidder as written. This language
has not been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As previously responded to, Article I, Section 1, and the Contract in general, regard a central office, including
all associated remote switching terminals, to be an indivisible unit. However, in the interest of brevity, this language
has been replaced with the word ``Project.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) REA agrees and has revised Article II, section 4, paragraph 4 to include the suggested language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the fourth paragraph of this Section imposes an artificial thirty (30) day requirement
for correction of deficiencies. They suggest the Section be amended to require corrections within thirty (30) days
of receipt of the REA Form 517 from the Borrower or by the scheduled date for Completion of the Project, whichever is
longer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA feels this Section offers the Bidder and the Borrower equal protection by imposing specific time limits for the
Borrower's tests and the Bidder's corrections. This language has not been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the first paragraph of this Section should be modified to permit the Bidder either to correct
the defect within 30 days or to agree with the Borrower during such 30 days on a course of correction reasonably designed
to cure the defect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA agrees. This Section has been revised to allow an extension of time if agreed upon by the Owner and REA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that refund and credit options should be included in the event a defect cannot reasonably be
corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such a provision would give the Bidder the right to simply ``buy back'' equipment or software when a problem is encountered.
To the Borrower, this means that essential features or capability could be lost and would remain unavailable for the
entire useful life of new switching equipment. The resulting reduction in value of the Contract to the borrower cannot
be predicted. This option has not been added to Form 525.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that minor ``bugs'' are inherent in all software and should not rise to the level of warranty
defects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter remarked that the Form 522 Specifications and not other technical material provided by the Bidder
should be the standard for software warranty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA feels the performance of the software must be in accordance with the Form 522 Specifications and Bidder documentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bidder documentation is furnished to assist the borrower in the operation, administration and maintenance of
the switch.

Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters remarked that this Section should be rewritten to add disclaimers and exclusive remedies and to
limit the Bidder's liabilities and limit the Owner's remedies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Section 7(b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters remarked that the warranty period for software should be shortened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA requires a five (5) year warranty period because software is information based and defects in seldom used programs
would not be detected until the program is used. REA believes that over a 5 year period even seldom used programs would
be used and any defects corrected.

Section 1(a),(b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that these subsections are unfair as written. Each central office and its associated remotes
should be treated separately for payment purposes to allow the Bidder to get paid for his investment in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article I, Section 1, and the Contract in general, regard a central office, including all associated remote switching
terminals, to be an indivisible unit for delivery, payment, turnover, closeout, liquidated damages, and other purposes.
A host office and its remotes are interdependent and alterations to one may affect the others. Therefore, REA regards

Section 1(c):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the phrase ``Completion of the Contract'' in this subsection should be changed to read
``Completion of the Project.'' This would enable the Bidder to receive the final ten percent (10%) for each Project
as it is satisfactorily completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These have been the standard REA Contract terms for many years. REA feels it offers sufficient protection to the Borrower
that the Contract will be completed in a satisfactory manner, while allowing the Bidder a return on its investment
prior to satisfactory completion of the Contract. Also, the Bidder can receive the final ten percent (10%) of a Project
if the partial closeout procedure is allowed.

Section 1(a), (b), (c):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that unproven features and capabilities should not delay payments for the Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unproven features and capabilities are listed as separate Projects in Article I, section 1, with separate time frames
for delivery and installation of features and capabilities that cannot be provided at the time of Completion of the
Project. If separate schedules are not part of the Contract, delays in delivery would cause delays in payments for
the entire Project. This encourages a Bidder's disclosures as required in Article V, section 2.

Section 1(b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters remarked that this Section is unfair to the Bidder. They feel that the Bidder should only be responsible
for damages caused by the Bidder and that the Borrower is in a much better position to protect its site, and guard against
fire, flood and theft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bidder is required by law to have insurance from commencement to completion of the Contract. The Bidder also has
charge and control of all work, equipment, materials and software to be done or used therein. Therefore, REA feels
the Bidder is in a better position during this time period to protect itself against risk of loss.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that commercial insurance is unnecessary. Specifically, the coverage limits required are
within the ``deductible'' for large companies. Thus the risk is self retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Insurance requirements for contractors are set forth in 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, Insurance for Contractors, Engineers
and Architects. Generally, this regulation is intended to set minimum coverage requirements for companies of all
sizes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA agrees. A Uniform Software License was drafted and published for comments on May 20, 1993, at 58 FR 29363, and was
published as a final rule on April 14, 1994, at 59 FR 17675. The final rule will be an addendum to any 525 or 545 Contract
that requires a license.

 One commenter remarked that some guarantees may not be transferable or assignable by the Bidder and this Section should
be subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer or assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article IV, section 6 has been revised to allow for restrictions on transfer of warranties. However, regardless of
restrictions upon transfer or assignment, the warranty coverage defined in Article II, section 7, is required.

Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters remarked that a buy back option should be allowed for infringement of intellectual property rights.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such a provision would give the Bidder the right simply to ``buy back'' equipment or software when a copyright problem
is encountered. To the Owner, this means that essential features or capability could be lost and would remain unavailable
for the entire useful life of the new switching equipment. The resulting reduction in value of the Contract to the Owner
cannot be predicted, and often would be greater than the amount the Owner paid for the price of the infringing equipment
or software.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the Bidder should be allowed to take pro-active steps to avoid an injunction, rather than
always having to react to an injunction after it is imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section merely states the action the Bidder must take to protect the Owner after the use of the equipment or software
is enjoined. It does not proscribe any action the Bidder may wish to take to protect its own interests and the Owner's
interests before the injunction is granted.

Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters remarked that the cap on liquidated damages is excessive and unrelated to any actual damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA believes that if a limit is to be set it should not be less than the price of the affected central office and all associated
remote switching units. This in many cases will be less than the total Contract price. This Section also instructs
the Owner to notify the Bidder in writing how the liquidated damages were computed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that previous draft versions of the 525 Central Office Equipment Contract better defined
``placed in service'' and assumes liquidated damages are applied based on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA believes that the wording ``used by the Owner to earn revenue'' more clearly defines ``placed in service.'' Article
V, sections 2 and 5, and Article VII, section 1, Definitions, clearly state that liquidated damages can only be assessed
and are the exclusive remedy when the Bidder has failed to complete the Project on time and are not based on when a central
office is placed in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the Bidder should not be assessed liquidated damages based on the entire Project when
a only a portion is delayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated previously, the central office and all associated remote switching terminals are a unit for the purposes
of this Contract. Liquidated damages are measured from ``Completion of Project.'' This gives the Bidder an incentive
to complete the Project in a timely manner. If liquidated damages were assessed on each individual part of a Project,
then in some cases the incentive to finish the Project on time would be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that liquidated damages should not apply to features or capabilities that are not fully developed
or do not have a verifiable satisfactory field performance because they have been accepted by the Owner and by definition
they are unproven. It was also felt that even if they are not exempt, liquidated damages should not apply if the central
office has been placed in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Owner allowed these unproven features to be bid based on a time period established by the Bidder for the availability
of these features. A Bidder's responsibility to provide the features or capabilities bid on, in the time period established
by the Bidder, cannot be diminished by notifying the Owner that they are not going to be available in the time promised.
The language in Article V, section 2, remains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquidated damages on unproven features are a measure of revenue that would be lost by that feature not being available
on time. It does not have a bearing on, and should not be associated with, revenue from the rest of the Project that is
in service. If it was as suggested in the comment, then it would be a penalty to the Owner in lost revenue for the Bidder
not completing the feature or capability as scheduled.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA feels the existing language clearly identifies the intent of this provision. Also, a Bidder's responsibility
to complete the Project as originally bid should not be diminished because of neglect by the Bidder to notify the Owner
of unproven or unavailable features or capabilities. The last sentence remains.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four commenters remarked on this section. From the comments received, it appears this section is still of great concern
to the equipment manufacturers. The comments and recommendations received are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Two commenters remarked that ten times the Contract price is excessive. Three commenters remarked that they should
be able to disclaim consequential damages. Two commenters remarked that that much exposure is probably not insurable
but if it was, the premiums would be excessive and would be passed on to the Owner. One commenter recommended that consequential
damages be the lesser of five times the purchase price of the affected central office and its associated remote terminals,
or $5.0 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) One commenter recommended that the Owner retain the liability since the Owner is in a better position to prevent
losses by properly maintaining its network. One commenter felt that consequential damages should only be available
during the warranty period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The existing Form 525 does not limit the liability for incidental or consequential damages. REA's intent is to
place a limit of liability on consequential and incidental damages, except for personal injury or tangible property
damage, which will: enable Bidders to insure for a risk of known limit; provide Owners with protection against losses
related to product failure; protect the government's loan security; and serve as a standard that Bidders and Owners
alike can expect to see on every Contract so competitive bidding can be facilitated. REA has established a liability
limit of ten times the total Contract amount, which will result in a limit in the range of $2.5 million to $10 million
for typical REA Contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consequential damages provide a measure of protection from loss due to product failure or other causes related
to the Bidder's performance. Since the risk of loss still exists after the warranty period, consequential damages
must also be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that in order to make the proposed draft consistent with the suggested addition of exclusive
remedies language in other sections, some minor language adjustments are needed for this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA has not added exclusive remedy language so no language adjustments were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 5:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that cumulative remedies should not apply for a normal warranty claim. The warranty provisions
of the Contract provide for a remedy and course of conduct in the event of a product failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The warranty provisions may not fully protect the Borrower in some situations. For example, a defective component,
serviced under Article II, section 6, could cause a consequential damages claim. The language in section 5 is unchanged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that a number of large national employers have made direct arrangements with the Office of

and language should be added to this Article VI to cover separately negotiated arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt the definition of Software should be expanded to clarify that Software means the Software provided
to the Owner by the Bidder hereunder and the words ``and similar design level documentation'' should be inserted after
the words ``source code'' in this subsection. It was also felt that the definition of Project should be expanded to
include remote switching terminal(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels the definition of the term ``Software'' is appropriate as written and will not be construed to mean any software
other than the software furnished for the Contract in question. The words ``and similar design level documentation''
have not been added to the words ``source code.'' Source code is a definable commodity but ``and similar *&blank;*&blank;*.''
is overly vague. REA also feels the definition of the word ``Project'' is sufficient. If a remote is to be a separate
Project, it must be listed as such in Article 1, section 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter is concerned that the Owner's failure to provide site availability and needed facilities for remotes
can unduly hold up Completion of the Project. The commenter proposed adding language to cover that event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels the definition of ``Completion of the Project'' is appropriate. The concerns of ``Site availability or
functionality'' not being available in a timely manner is covered under Article II, section 1, Time of Completion
of Installation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters remarked on this section. Their comments are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One commenter remarked that this Section still requires that equipment and software support be provided for five
or eight years from discontinuing the manufacture of that Equipment. The commenter feels this time period should
commence upon Completion of the Contract. It is felt this provision as drafted would penalize Bidders which enhance
and manufacture existing equipment and reward Bidders who discontinue manufacture of equipment and develop new
and incompatible equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) One commenter wanted to revise the language to change the intent of this paragraph and also add a provision for
a one (1) year software warranty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA previously responded in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on March 14, 1991, at 56 FR 10827, that it concludes, based on previous comments, that this new Section strikes a reasonable
balance for sellers and buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that its only area of concern arises in a two fold fashion. To begin with, the use of the word ``and''
following the word ``substantially'' in the first sentence interferes with the intended meaning of the sentence,
and as such, should be deleted. The specific concern arises from the wording of this section 3, Notwithstanding the
possibility of authorization by the Administrator, it suggests that such authorization is permissive, not mandatory
and that therefore the intent of REA Bulletin 344&hyph;3 is not met. The commenter submits that such authorization
be mandatory in the event the valuation conditions of the Bulletin are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The word ``and'' following ``substantially'' in the first sentence is a typographical error and has been changed
to ``all.'' In regard to the Administrator's authorization being permissive, the Administrator's authorization
is not required when the conditions of Bulletin 344&hyph;3 are met. It is only required when the conditions of Bulletin
344&hyph;3, paragraph IV.B. or IV.C. are not met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the proposed draft has added a new sentence to this section which releases the borrower
from its obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the Bidder's proprietary information if the Bidder fails
to fulfill its continuing support obligations. The commenter believes the proposed remedy for such a problem is overly
broad and is punitive to the Bidder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels this section offers sufficient protection for the Bidder and the Owner. The only way the Owner can be released
from the confidentiality requirement is by the Bidder's failure to meet the obligations of the Form 525 Contract.
Article VI, section 6, as proposed, provides some incentive not to violate the obligations of the Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 12: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the Bidder not be required to obtain the consent of its surety for all sub-contractors.
It is felt that if the surety makes such a requirement on the Bidder, this language adds nothing to the Bidder's obligation
to obtain proper protection. On the other hand, if such a condition is not required by the surety, there should be no
need to retain this condition.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only way the REA and the Owner can be assured that the surety allows subcontractors is by written consent. The language
in this section remains unchanged.

Section 12: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that either party should be permitted to subcontract the Agreement to an affiliate without
the consent of the other party. A corporate restructuring of a Bidder should not be able to be arbitrarily held up by
a single Owner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA does not feel that a Bidder should be allowed to arbitrarily subcontract an REA Contract without the proper consent,
which will not be unreasonably withheld. This language has worked well in the past and REA feels it will continue to
work well in the future.

to the site for the sole purpose of assisting in these tests. Acceptance tests shall be performed within 30 days of completion
of the installation, unless otherwise requested in writing by the contractor and approved in writing by the borrower.

for the purpose of receiving the Bidder's Technical Proposal, discussing details of the Project(s), and considering
suggestions from Bidders. The Owner shall attach to this Notice a list of the information required in the Bidder's
Technical Proposal. Each Bidder will be given a specific time period for the pre-bid technical session. At the pre-bid
technical session, the Bidder shall fully describe to the Owner any exceptions to the Specifications the Bidder may
request. In addition, the Bidder shall identify all features and capabilities that are not fully developed or do not
have a verifiable satisfactory field performance record. If the Owner decides to incorporate any changes into the
Specifications, the Owner shall furnish all prospective Bidders a copy of the Specifications containing such revisions
(the ``Revised Specifications'') and all Bids shall be made on the basis of the Revised Specifications. At this session,
the Bidder shall identify all documentation and materials that it claims constitute agreed excluded documentation
under section (2)(xi) of the Software License. The Bidder shall claim as agreed excluded documentation only those
items it may be unable to provide to the Borrower as required by said section (2)(xi). The Engineer shall immediately
provide a list of all items so identified to [appropriate REA office]. The Engineer shall inform the Bidder at least

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 days before the scheduled bid opening whether either the Engineer or [REA] will reject the Bid because of items so identified.
Licensor agrees that certain Licensed Software cannot be excluded from the requirements of said section (2)(xi),
including but not limited to software that would significantly impair the operation of the System, would significantly
impair the ability of the Owner to generate revenue, or would pose a risk to REA loan security. If allowed, the agreed
excluded documentation shall be individually identified in an attachment to the Bid. No bid shall be accepted from
a Bidder who fails to attend the pre-bid technical session or fails to demonstrate to the Owner that its equipment meets
the requirements of the Plans and Specifications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Proposals shall be submitted on the forms furnished by the Owner and must be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed
to the Owner. The name and address of the Bidder, its license number, if a license is required for bidding on a project
by the State, and the date and hour of the opening of bids must appear on the envelope in which the Proposal is submitted.
Proposals must be in ink or typewritten. No alterations or interlineations will be permitted, unless made, initialed,
and dated before submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Prior to the submission of the Proposal, the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to have made a careful examination
of the Specifications, forms of Bidder's Proposal and Acceptance, and Contractor's Bond attached hereto, and shall
become informed as to the location and characteristics of the proposed central office and remote terminal installations,
features and services, the transportation facilities, the kind of facilities required before and during the delivery
and installation of the equipment and materials, the general local conditions and all other matters that may affect
the cost and the time of completion of the installations. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes,
codes, and regulations, including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors and the ``Anti Kick-Back Acts,''
as amended, (40 U.S.C. 276c; 41 U.S.C. 51 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations issued pursuant thereto, and 18 U.S.C. 287, 874, 1001, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond, in the form attached, or a certified check on a bank that is a member
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
of the maximum possible bid price. The maximum possible bid price is the sum of the total base bid, spare parts, maintenance
tools and all positive amounts for alternates. Each Bidder agrees that, if its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals,
its Bid Bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and Contractor's Bond, when required, is
furnished by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not
to exceed ninety (90) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals whichever period shall be the
shorter. If such Proposal is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned to the Bidder within
a period of thirty (30) days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The successful Bidder will be required to furnish to the Owner a Contractor's Bond in conformance with the requirements
of 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, Insurance for Contractors, Engineers, and Architects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to furnish a Contractor's Bond within thirty (30) days after written
notification of the award of the Contract by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal.
In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified
check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference (not
exceeding the amount of the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the
Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project(s). The term ``successful Bidder'' shall
be deemed to include any Bidder whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been
unable to execute the Contract or to furnish a Contractor's Bond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If requested by the Owner or the Administrator, the Bidder shall furnish evidence, satisfactory to the Owner and
the Administrator, that the Bidder has the necessary facilities, ability, and financial resources to perform the
Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Contract, when executed, shall be deemed to include the entire agreement between the parties thereto and neither
party shall claim any modification thereof resulting from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer,
agent, or employee of the other or by any other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal, if it appears to the
Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived
must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the execution of any Contract which may be awarded thereon.
Failure to provide a Bid Bond or check as specified in item six (6) above is not a minor irregularity.

These goals are applicable to all the Contractor's construction work (whether or not it is federal or federally assisted)
performed in the covered area. If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside
of the covered area, it shall apply the goals established for such geographical area where work is actually performed.
With regard to this second area, the Contractor also is subject to the goals for both its federally involved and nonfederally
involved construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Contractor's compliance with Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1963&hyph;1965 Comp., p. 340) and the regulations
in 41 CFR part 60&hyph;4 shall be based on its implementation of the Equal Opportunity Clause, specific affirmative
action obligations required by the specifications set forth in 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.3(a), and its efforts to meet the
goals. The hours of minority and female employment and training must be substantially uniform throughout the length
of the contract, and in each trade, and the Contractor shall make a good faith effort to employ minorities and women
evenly on each of its projects. Transfer of minority or female employees or trainees from Contractor to Contractor
or from project to project for the sole purpose of meeting the Contractor's goals shall be a violation of the contract,
Executive Order 11246 and the regulations in 41 CFR part 60&hyph;4. Compliance with the goals will be measured against
the total work hours performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Contractor shall provide written notification to the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs within 10 working days of award of any construction subcontract in excess of $10,000 at any tier for construction
work under the contract resulting from this solicitation. The notification shall list the name, address and telephone
number of the subcontractor; employer identification number of the subcontractor; estimated dollar amount of the
subcontract; estimated starting and completion dates of the subcontract; and the geographical area in which the
subcontract is to be performed.

Section 2. Acceptable Equipment. Unless otherwise specified by the Owner (and agreed to in advance in writing by REA),
the Bidder agrees to furnish under this Proposal only equipment which is currently covered by a letter of acceptance
issued by the Chairman, Committee ``A'' (Telephone). [Note: for convenience of borrowers and others, domestically

Section 3. Changes in Project. The Owner, with the approval of the Administrator, may from time to time during the performance
of the Contract effected by the acceptance of this Proposal, make reasonable changes, additions to or subtractions
from the Specifications which are part of the Proposal as conditions may warrant. However, if substantial changes
in the Project shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Bidder shall make a
written request therefor to the Owner within thirty (30) days after any such change is made. Further, if the cost to
the Bidder shall be increased or decreased by any such change or addition, the Contract price shall be increased or
decreased by a reasonable amount in accordance with a contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved
by the Administrator. No claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless
the Bidder shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with
such change or addition. The Delivery or Completion of Installation times specified under Columns 5, ``Delivery'',
and 6, ``Completion of Installation,'' in Article I, section 1, can only be changed by a Contract amendment approved

Section 1. Time of Completion of Installation. The time of delivery of materials, equipment, and software and of Completion
of Installation are of the essence of this Contract. The Bidder shall deliver the materials, equipment, and software
required hereunder for each Project upon the time intervals established under Column 5, ``Delivery,'' in Article
I, section 1, after the Administrator shall have approved this Contract in writing, and shall prosecute diligently
and complete the installation of materials, equipment and software for each Project in accordance with the terms
of this Contract and Specifications to the satisfaction of the Owner and the Administrator within the number of calendar
days specified under Column 6, ``Completion of Installation,'' in Article I, section 1. The times for such Delivery
or such Completion of Installation shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay due exclusively to causes
beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires, strikes,
floods, changes in the Specifications as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters
for which the Owner is solely responsible. However, no such extension of time shall be granted the Bidder unless within
thirty (30) days after Bidder becomes aware of the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension
of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner. Further, no delay in such time for delivery
of materials, equipment and software or Completion of Installation or in the progress of the work shall result in any
liability on the part of the Owner, except that the Owner shall be responsible for and shall pay the Bidder on demand
all additional, supportable costs and expenses incurred by the Bidder due to delays to the extent such delays are caused
by the Owner's failure to perform its obligations under this Contract unless the Owner's failure to perform is caused
by forces beyond its control.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1. Completion on Bidder's Default. If default shall be made by the Bidder in the performance of any of the work
hereunder, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable remedies in the circumstances, may serve
upon the Bidder and the surety or sureties upon the Bidder's Bond or Bonds a written notice requiring the Bidder to cause
such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within thirty (30) days after the service of such notice upon the Bidder
such default shall be corrected or arrangements for the correction thereof, satisfactory to both the Owner and the
Administrator, shall have been made by the Bidder or its surety or sureties, the Owner may take over the performance
of the Bidder's obligations hereunder and prosecute the same to completion by contract or otherwise for the account
and at the expense of the Bidder, and the Bidder and its surety or sureties shall be liable to the Owner for any supportable
cost or expense in excess of the bid price occasioned thereby. In such event, the Owner may take possession of and utilize,
in completing the Project(s), any tools, supplies, equipment, appliances and plant belonging to the Bidder which
may be situated at the site of the Project(s). The Owner, in such contingency, may exercise any rights, claims or demands
which the Bidder may have against third persons in connection herewith and for such purpose the Bidder does hereby
assign, transfer and set over unto the Owner all such rights, claims and demands.

time, if any, herein provided, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness damages
caused by such delay, the Owner shall, so long as the subject Project shall not have been placed in service, have the
right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys which may be then due, or which may become due and payable to the Bidder,

Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount claimed as liquidated
damages was computed. The Bidder shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment in full. Such payment
is not to be reduced by the value of any partial performance by the Bidder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
At the technical sessions, each Bidder shall identify all features and capabilities that are not fully developed
or do not have a verifiable satisfactory field performance record. If the Owner allows these features to be bid as separate
Projects, then they are to be individually listed under Columns 1 through 10, in Article I, section 1. These unproven
features and capabilities are to be individually listed in this section 2 also, with liquidated damages amounts determined
by the Owner and stated for each. If a Bidder neglects to identify any such feature at the technical session, delay in
providing the feature is considered a delay in completing the associated Project and the Owner may assess liquidated
damages listed for that Project regardless of whether the Project is placed in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3. Consequential Damages. In no event shall the Bidder's liability for incidental or consequential loss
or damage, except for personal injury or tangible property damage, exceed the amount of ten times the total contract
price, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or enforce any remedy which the Owner may exercise or enforce hereunder.

Section 5. Cumulative Remedies. Every right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Owner or the Administrator
shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every right and remedy now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
by statute and the pursuit of any right or remedy shall not be construed as an election. Provided, however, that the
provisions of section 2 of this Article V shall be the exclusive measure of damages for failure by the Bidder to have
effected the Completion of Project within the time herein agreed upon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, furnished the Equal Employment Opportunity Employers Information Report EEO&hyph;1, Standard Form 100, required
of employers with 100 or more employees pursuant to Executive Order 11246 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Bidder agrees that it will obtain, prior to the award of any subcontract for more than $10,000 hereunder to a
subcontractor with 100 or more employees, a statement, signed by the proposed subcontractor, that the proposed subcontractor
has filed a current report on Standard Form 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Bidder agrees that if it has 100 or more employees and has not submitted a report on Standard Form 100 for the current
reporting year and that if this contract will amount to more than $10,000, the Bidder will file such report, as required
by law, and notify the Owner in writing of such filing prior to the Owner's acceptance of this Proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Bidder certifies that it does not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of
its establishments, and that it does not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its
control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder certifies further that it will not maintain or provide
for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it will not permit its employees
to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder
agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity Clause in this contract. As used
in this certification, the term ``segregated facilities'' means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms,
restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots,
drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees
which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national
origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. The Bidder agrees that (except where it has obtained identical
certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time periods) it will obtain identical certifications
from proposed subcontractors prior to the award of subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions
of the Equal Opportunity Clause, and that it will retain such certifications in its files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2. During the performance of this contract, the Contractor agrees as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color,
religion, sex or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed,
and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment
or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for
training, including apprenticeship. The Contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places available to employees
and applicants for employment, notices to be provided setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the Contractor,
state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion,
sex or national origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which the Bidder has a collective
bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided advising the said labor union or
workers' representative of the Contractor's commitments under this section, and shall post copies of the notice
in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and of the rules,
regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965,
and by rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to the Contractor's
books, records and accounts by the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation
to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations and orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In the event of the Contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any
of the said rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated or suspended in whole or in part
and the Contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts or federally assisted construction
contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other
sanctions as may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in the said Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965,
or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Contractor will include the portion of the sentence immediately preceding paragraph (a) and the provisions
of paragraphs (a) through (g) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations or orders
of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to Section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such
provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The Contractor will take such action with respect to
any subcontract or purchase order as the administering agency may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions,
including actions for noncompliance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
that in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor
as a result of such direction by the administering agency, the Contractor may request the United States to enter into
such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Covered area'' means the geographical area described in the solicitation from which this contract resulted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Director'' means Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, United States Department of Labor,
or any person to whom the Director delegates authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Employer identification number'' means the Federal Social Security number used on the Employer's Quarterly Federal
Tax Return, U.S. Treasury Department Form 941; and

``Minority'' includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Black (all persons having origins in any of the Black African racial groups not of Hispanic origin); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American or other Spanish Culture or
origin, regardless of race); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast
Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of North America
and maintaining identifiable tribal affiliations through membership and participation or community identification).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Whenever the Contractor, or any Subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts a portion of the work involving any construction
trade, it shall physically include in each subcontract in excess of $10,000 the provisions of these specifications
and the Notice which contains the applicable goals for minority and female participation and which is set forth in
the solicitations from which this contract resulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the Contractor is participating (pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.5) in a Hometown Plan approved by the U.S. Department
of Labor in the covered area either individually or through an association, its affirmative action obligations on
all work in the Plan area (including goals and timetables) shall be in accordance with that Plan for those trades which
have unions participating in the Plan. Contractors must be able to demonstrate their participation in and compliance
with the provisions of any such Hometown Plan. Each Contractor or Subcontractor participating in an approved Plan
is individually required to comply with its obligations under the EEO clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve
each goal under the Plan in each trade in which it has employees. The overall good faith performance by other Contractors
or Subcontractors toward a goal in an approved Plan does not excuse any covered Contractor's or Subcontractor's failure
to take good faith efforts to achieve the Plan goals and timetables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor shall implement the specific affirmative action standards provided in paragraphs (g) (i) through
(xvi) of these specifications. The goals set forth in the solicitation from which this contract resulted are expressed
as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization the Contractor should
reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area. Covered construction
contractors performing construction work in geographical areas where they do not have a federal or federally assisted
construction contract shall apply the minority and female goals established for the geographical area where the
work is being performed. Goals are published periodically in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in notice form, and such notices may be obtained from any Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs office or
from Federal procurement contracting officers. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress
in meeting its goals in each craft during the period specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with whom the Contractor
has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer either minorities or women shall excuse the Contractor's obligations
under these specifications, Executive Order 11246, or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, such
apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the Contractor must have
made a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability
of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department
of Labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Contractor shall take specific affirmative actions to ensure equal employment opportunity. The evaluation
of the Contractor's compliance with these specifications shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results
from its actions. The Contractor shall document these efforts fully, and shall implement affirmative action steps
at least as extensive as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Ensure and maintain a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites, and in
all facilities at which the Contractor's employees are assigned to work. The Contractor, where possible, will assign
two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall specifically ensure that all foremen, superintendents,
and other on-site supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a
working environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals working at such sites or in such facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Establish and maintain a current list of minority and female recruitment sources, provide written notification
to minority and female recruitment sources and to community organizations when the Contractor or its unions have
employment opportunities available, and maintain a record of the organizations' responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Maintain a current file of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street
applicant and minority or female referral from a union, a recruitment source or community organization and of what
action was taken with respect to each such individual. If such individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral
and was not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred, not employed by the Contractor, this shall
be documented in the file with the reason therefore, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have
taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Provide immediate written notification to the Director when the union or unions with which the Contractor has
a collective bargaining agreement has not referred to the Contractor a minority person or woman sent by the Contractor,
or when the Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts
to meet its obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area which expressly
include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to
the Contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The
Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under (g)(ii) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy by providing notice of the policy to unions and training programs and
requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its EEO obligations; by including it in any policy
manual and collective bargaining agreement; by publicizing it in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.; by
specific review of the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once
a year; and by posting the company EEO policy on bulletin boards accessible to all employees at each location where
construction work is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Review, at least annually, the company's EEO policy and affirmative action obligations under these specifications
with all employees having any responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination or other employment decisions
including specific review of these items with onsite supervisory personnel such as Superintendents, General Foremen,
etc., prior to the initiation of construction work at any job site. A written record shall be made and maintained identifying
the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject
matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy externally by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically
including minority and female news media, and providing written notification to and discussing the Contractor's
EEO policy with other Contractors and Subcontractors with whom the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Direct its recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female and community organizations, to
schools with minority and female students and to minority and female recruitment and training organizations serving
the Contractor's recruitment area and employment needs. Not later than one month prior to the date for the acceptance
of applications for apprenticeship or other training by any recruitment source, the Contractor shall send written
notification to organizations such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be
used in the selection process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(x) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other minority persons and women and, where reasonable,
provide after school, summer and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the site and in other areas
of a Contractor's work force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Validate all tests and other selection requirements where there is an obligation to do so under 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;3.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female personnel for promotional
opportunities and encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., such
opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiii) Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments and other personnel practices,
do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment related activities to
ensure that the EEO policy and the Contractor's obligations under these specifications are being carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiv) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user toilet
and necessary changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xv) Document and maintain a record of all solicitations of offers for subcontracts from minority and female construction
contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations
and other business associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xvi) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the Contractor's
EEO policies and affirmative action obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Contractors are encouraged to participate in voluntary associations which assist in fulfilling one or more of
their affirmative action obligations (g) (i) through (xvi). The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union,
contractor-community, or other similar group of which the Contractor is a member and participant, may be asserted
as fulfilling any one or more of its obligations under (g) (i) through (xvi) of these specifications provided that
the Contractor actively participates in the group, makes every effort to assure that the group has a positive impact
on the employment of minorities and women in the industry, ensures that the concrete benefits of the program are reflected
in the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation, makes a good faith effort to meet its individual
goals and timetables, and can provide access to documentation which demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken
on behalf of the Contractor. The obligation to comply, however, is the Contractor's and failure of such a group to fulfill
an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's noncompliance.

(i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established. The Contractor, however,
is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both
male and female, and all women, both minority and non-minority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation
of Executive Order 11246 if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner (for example, even
though the Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive
Order 11246 if a specific minority group of women is underutilized). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action standards to discriminate against
any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) The Contractor shall not enter into any Subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts
pursuant to Executive Order 11246. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of these specifications and of the Equal
Opportunity Clause, including suspension, termination and cancellation of existing subcontracts as may be imposed
or ordered pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the Office of Federal
Contract Compliance Programs. Any Contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions and penalties shall be in violation
of these specifications and Executive Order 11246, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The Contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these specifications, shall implement specific affirmative
action steps, at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph (g) of these specifications, so as
to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply
with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, the implementing regulations, or these specifications, the Director
shall proceed in accordance with 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor all employment related activity to ensure that
the company EEO policy is being carried out, to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof as may be required
by the Government and to keep records. Records shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone
numbers, construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification number when assigned, social security
number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status,
hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall
be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy
this requirement, contractors shall not be required to maintain separate records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) Nothing herein provided shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws which establish
different standards of compliance or upon the application of requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents
(e.g. those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).

the Bidder of (a) all documents listed in Article III, section 2, (b) other final documents, and (c) written notification
that all deficiencies listed on the REA Form 517, Results of Acceptance Test, have been corrected; provided, that
the final inspection and tests by the Owner finds the deficiencies satisfactorily resolved. If the deficiencies

are fully and satisfactorily resolved as determined by subsequent Owner's tests. The Certificate of Completion
approved and signed by the Owner and approved in writing by the Administrator shall be conclusive evidence as to the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements the statutory authority of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank) to accept
from non-Federal sources reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred by Eximbank employees in connection
with official travel to a meeting or similar event. Authorized meetings or similar events under this final rule do
not include those described in the Federal Travel Regulations permitting Federal agencies to accept payments from
non-Federal sources for travel expenses. This final rule, by effectuating Eximbank's statutory gift acceptance
authority, will further the mission of Eximbank by enabling Eximbank to issue more official travel orders for employees
to conduct agency business than Eximbank would otherwise be able to issue under its authorized annual travel budget.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2(a)(1) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635(a)), enables Eximbank, subject to
regulations issued pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, to accept reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred
by a director, officer or employee of Eximbank in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States
Code. In order to implement this statutory authority, Eximbank is issuing a regulation that sets forth the parameters
for accepting payment from a non-Federal source for an Eximbank employee's travel and subsistence expenses to attend
or participate in an event relating to the employee's official duties. The regulation applies to events other than
a ``meeting or similar function'' as defined in 41 CFR 304&hyph;1.2(c)(3). The rule enables Eximbank to accept travel
expense payments in order to send employees to such functions as meetings, formal gatherings, site visits, negotiation
sessions and other similar events in which the employee's participation would further the mission of Eximbank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid any actual impropriety or appearance of impropriety in the acceptance of travel expense payments,
the regulation requires that the employee's supervisor and the designated agency ethics official or his/her designee
determine that Eximbank's interest in the employee's attendance at the meeting or similar event outweighs concern
that acceptance of the payment by Eximbank may cause a reasonable person to question the integrity of Eximbank's programs
or operations. As provided in the authorizing statute, the regulation limits payments from a non-Federal source
for travel and subsistence payments to the maximum per diem or actual service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter
301.

Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As General Counsel of Eximbank, I have found good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)(3) for waiving, as unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking and the 30-day delay in effectiveness
as to this final rule. The reason for this determination is that this rulemaking is related to Eximbank organization,
procedure and practice.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As General Counsel of Eximbank, I have determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this
regulation will not have a significant impact on small business entities.

apply because this regulation does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval
of the Office of Management and Budget.

As provided in this part, Eximbank may accept payment from a non-Federal source (or authorize an employee to receive
such payment on its behalf) with respect to attendance of the employee at a meeting or similar event which the employee
has been authorized to attend in an official capacity on behalf of Eximbank. The employee's immediate supervisor
and Eximbank's designated agency ethics official or his/her designee (DAEO) must approve any offer and acceptance
of payment under this part in accordance with the procedures described below. If the employee is a member of Eximbank's
Board of Directors, only the DAEO's approval is required. Any employee authorized to travel in accordance with this
part is subject to the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation class of service limitations
prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Eximbank may accept payment for employee travel from a non-Federal source when a written authorization to accept
payment is issued in advance of the travel following a determination by the employee's supervisor (except in the case
of Board members) and the DAEO that the payment is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For travel relating to an employee's official duties under an official travel authorization issued to the employee;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For attendance at a meeting or similar event as defined in &sect;412.3(c)(3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In which the employee's participation is necessary in order to further the mission of Eximbank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Which cannot be held at the offices of Eximbank for justifiable business reasons in light of the location and number
of participants and the purpose of the meeting or similar event; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Which is taking place at a location and for a period of time that is appropriate for the purpose of the meeting or
similar event; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) From a non-Federal source that is not a conflicting non-Federal source or from a conflicting non-Federal source
that has been approved under &sect;412.9; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In an amount which does not exceed the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation
class of service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An employee requesting approval of payment of travel expenses by a non-Federal source under this part shall submit
to the employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO a written description of the following:
the nature of the meeting or similar event and the reason that it cannot be held at Eximbank, the date(s) and location
of the meeting or similar event, the identities of all participants in the meeting or similar event, the name of the
non-Federal source offering to make the payment, the amount and method of the proposed payment, and the nature of the
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eximbank may accept payment from a conflicting non-Federal source if the conditions of &sect;412.7 are met and the
employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO determine that Eximbank's interest in the
employee's attendance at or participation in the meeting or similar event outweighs concern that acceptance of the
payment by Eximbank may cause a reasonable person to question the integrity of Eximbank's programs and operations.
In determining whether to accept payment, Eximbank shall consider all relevant factors, including the purpose of
the meeting or similar event, the importance of the travel for Eximbank, the nature and sensitivity of any pending
matter affecting the interests of the conflicting non-Federal source, the significance of the employee's role in
any such matter, the identity of other expected participants, and the location and duration of the meeting or similar
event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If Eximbank determines in advance of the travel that a payment covers some but not all of the per diem costs to be incurred

by an employee to attend a meeting or similar function described in and authorized by 41 CFR part 304&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations for delegations of authority relating to general
redelegations of authority from the Associate Commissioner of Regulatory Affairs to certain FDA officials in the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The redelegation provides these officials with authority to
grant or deny certain citizen petitions for exemption or variance from medical device tracking requirements. This
action is being taken to facilitate expeditious handling of citizen petitions. FDA is also issuing a conforming amendment
to the medical device tracking regulations to make the regulations consistent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule revises certain provisions in HUD regulations covering multifamily mortgage insurance which have the
effect of requiring prior HUD endorsement before the expenditure of any fire and hazard insurance loss proceeds by
mortgagees. Instead of this requirement the regulations would be revised to allow loss proceeds to be expended to
restore or repair the property without prior HUD approval. The proceeds may not however, be used for any other purposes
without prior HUD approval.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under existing HUD regulations (24 CFR 207.260) in the event a loss occurs to the mortgaged property under any policy
of fire or other hazard insurance and the mortgagee has received the proceeds therefrom, it shall not exercise its
option under the mortgage to use the proceeds of the insurance for the repairing, replacing, or rebuilding of the premises,
or apply them to the mortgage indebtedness, or make any other disposition of the proceeds without the prior written
approval of the Commissioner. Through cross-referencing this requirement is also made applicable to other FHA multifamily
programs

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule revises current regulatory requirements to provide that the mortgagee may exercise its option to use the
insurance proceeds for the repairing, replacing or rebuilding of the premises without prior HUD approval. It may
not however make any other disposition of insurance proceeds without prior approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has found that its Field Office staff resources can be more effectively allocated to tasks other than
the endorsing of property insurance loss drafts where the proceeds, in any event, are going to be used to restore or
repair the property. We estimate that from $10,000 to $20,000 per year in staff resources could be saved by making this
change. Mortgagees could have similar savings (from reduction of paperwork and check cashing steps) of from $5,000
to $10,000 per year. Project owners also could have savings. Approximately 20,000 project owners, their mortgagees
and their insurance agents and companies should benefit by eliminating this unnecessary procedural step.

The rule also makes conforming revisions to 24 CFR 207.10, 213.13, 221.521 and 242.43 of HUD regulations to provide
that fire and hazard and insurance have attached a standard mortgagee clause making loss payable to the mortgagee,
its successors and assigns rather than the current requirement that loss be payable to the mortgagee and the Commissioner
as their interests may appear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the strictly technical nature of this rule, the Department has determined that the notice and public comment
procedure under Title 5 of the United States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as a final rule.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 515 (the ``Regulations''),
to eliminate the requirement that the arrival and departure of planes providing travel between Cuba and the United
States occur during the normal business hours of the U.S. Customs Service. This change is being effected to allow greater
flexibility in arranging for authorized flights to Cuba. In addition, the Regulations are being amended to add references
to the Cuban Democracy Act, 22 U.S.C. 6001&hyph;6010, and to correct an error in &sect;515.701. Section 515.417 is
removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rule involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

 This rule amends the Libyan Sanctions Regulations to remove from the definition of ``Government of Libya'' a provision
stating that an entity will not be deemed a part of that government solely because it is located in, organized under
the laws of, or has its principal place of business in, Libya, and to make an additional change to the definition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the ``Regulations''), to remove paragraph (b)
from &sect; 550.304, the definition of the term ``Government of Libya.'' Paragraph (b) of &sect;550.304 provided
that a partnership, association, corporation, or other organization shall not be deemed to be within the term ``Government
of Libya'' solely by reason of being located in, organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business
in, Libya. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, former paragraph (a)(2) is revised to remove the word ``substantially,'' which was used to describe
the extent of Libyan government control of an entity required to qualify that entity as a part of the Government of Libya,
and to add the words ``directly or indirectly'' to describe the nature of the governmental control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Corps is revoking the regulations in 33 CFR 209.135 and 209.147. The regulations in &sect;209.135 prohibit structures
within shipping safety fairways in the Gulf of Mexico and prescribe certain conditions for nationwide permits issued
by the Corps for temporary anchors and chains for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs. Similar rules were promulgated
in 33 CFR 322.5 and through an oversight, the rules of Section 209.135 were not revoked at that time. Section 209.147
which establish the Guidelines for the Industry Capability Program is no longer needed and these guidelines are removed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Corps published rules pertaining to shipping safety fairways in 33 CFR 322.5(1) on November 13, 1986, (51 FR 41206&hyph;41260)
to consolidate all permit matters under the same section. These rules replaced the rules in 33 CFR 209.135 and the Corps
intended to subsequently revoke the rules in &sect;209.135. The rules in &sect;209.135 are duplicative and unnecessary.
Pursuant to its general authorities to operate and maintain Federal navigation projects, the Corps conducted a study
to determine the capability of the dredging industry to accomplish the Government's dredging work at reasonable
costs and in a timely manner. The Guidelines in 33 CFR 209.147 provided uniform procedures to evaluate Corps/Industry
roles over a four-year period. That study has been completed and accordingly, these Guidelines are no longer needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corps has determined that notice of proposed rulemaking and public procedures thereto are unnecessary and impractical
in this instance since this action will only remove obsolete materials from the CFR.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), it is certified that the removal
of these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The removal
of these two regulations will not have any effect on the public, any private enterprise or any Government agency. This
action will result in the removal of two obsolete regulations from the CFR.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes procedures for nominating, evaluating, and designating significant caves on lands
administered as part of the National Forest System. The rule also establishes procedures for releasing information
about the location of caves and establishes general prohibitions to protect cave resources from abuse and degradation.
The intended effect is to fully implement the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 on National Forest System
lands and to ensure that National Forest System lands are managed in a manner to protect and maintain, to the extent
practicable, significant caves. These regulations have been developed in close consultation with the Department
of the Interior to ensure uniformity and consistency in approach to the extent that statutory authority permits.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4301&hyph;4309; 102 Stat. 4546), hereafter referred
to as the ``Act'', seeks to secure, protect, and preserve significant caves on Federal lands for the perpetual use,
enjoyment, and benefit of all people. The Act also seeks to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information
between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, educational,
or recreational purposes. The Act requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue such regulations as he deems necessary
to achieve the purposes of the Act on National Forest System lands. The regulations are required to include, but need
not be limited to, criteria for the identification of significant caves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 3, 1989, the Forest Service published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting comments on what should be included in a proposed rule, and particularly requesting suggestions as to criteria
for identifying a significant cave. A total of nine comments were received in response to that notice: 4 from agencies
of State government, 2 from business entities, 2 from individuals, and 1 from a Federal agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on December 23, 1991 (56 FR 66388). The proposed rule described the process
the Forest Service would use in designating significant caves, provided for public nomination of caves, specified
six criteria by which a cave would be evaluated to determine whether it is significant, and identified the authorized
officer as the authority for designating and documenting a significant cave. The proposed rule also specified how
cave information and locations would be released. Lastly, the proposed rule revised certain prohibitions specific
to caves and cave resources. Seventy-six letters were received during the 90-day comment period in response to the
proposed rule: 30 from individuals, 18 from cave-related organizations, 16 from Federal agencies, 5 from natural
resource organizations, 4 from business entities, and 3 from State agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received are available for review in the Office of the Director, Recreation, Cultural Resources, and
Wilderness Management Staff, Auditors Building, 4th Floor, 201 14th Street, S.W. at Independence Ave., SW., Washington,
DC, during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Monday through Friday.

Analysis of Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall, almost all respondents were pleased that the Forest Service was promulgating regulations. Many offered
valuable suggestions for improving or clarifying specific sections. Some of these suggestions were group efforts,
using similar or identical language to identify and describe their interests, concerns, and recommended modifications
to the proposed rule. A few letters endorsed other respondents' statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of comments centered on four major issues in the proposed 261 and 290 rules: scope of the rule, including
the definition and manner of determining the significance of a cave; confidentiality of cave information; public
participation; and differences with the proposed rule (57 FR 1344) published by Department of the Interior on January
13, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments also referred to information contained in a document entitled ``Proposed Procedure for Listing
Significant Caves,'' which was circulated at the same time as the proposed rule but was not intended for codification
in the regulations. This document described a proposed implementation process in greater detail. These comments
also were considered as part of the rulemaking record to the extent that they were relevant to the provisions of the
rulemaking.

General Comments on 36 CFR Part 290
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, cave protection regulations would be set out in title 36, part 290, of the Code of Federal Regulations.
The following summarizes general comments received on the proposed rule and the Department's response to them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Cooperation and Consultation With the Department of Interior
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents noted disparities between the Forest Service proposed rule and the proposed rule issued at the same
time by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI). Most respondents recommended that the final rule of both agencies
be as similar as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout the rulemaking process, the Forest Service and USDI land managing agencies have been participating in
an interagency committee to agree on cave resource standards and procedures. The goal has been to adopt rules as similar
as possible. However, each agency has a different statutory background and mission which result in some procedural
differences such as in integrating cave resource protection into planning processes, delegations of authority,
and information requirements. In these instances, the language may differ to reflect the specific authorities of
the agencies involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Public Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of respondents felt the proposed rule completely ignored Section 2(b)(2) of the Act which states that
one purpose of the Act is ``to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities
and those who utilize caves for scientific, education, or recreational purposes.'' Respondents believed the proposed
rule denied the caving community access to cave information thus discouraging the exchange of information. Many
respondents recommended that public interaction occur through establishment of an advisory committee and the development
of volunteer agreements. Some respondents felt that these two actions were required by the Act in Sections 4(b)(3)
and 4(b)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under &sect;290.3 of the proposed rule, the agency intended that the public be given the opportunity to nominate significant
caves. Additionally, proposed &sect;290.4 provided a process by which information on caves and their location could
be disclosed to bona fide educational or research organizations although not to the general cave recreationing community.
Additionally, under the proposed rule, the agency envisioned addressing cave resource protection standards in
forest plans pursuant to National Forest Management Act and implementing regulations. Forest plans are developed
with full public participation; however, in response to comments on the proposed rule, the final rule does strengthen
and encourage greater cooperation and exchange of information in the nomination and evaluation process as well as
in a new provision permitting the disclosure of cave information to groups who assist the Federal land managing agencies
with cave management. These changes are discussed in the section-by-section discussion of comments which follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestion to form an advisory committee has not been adopted. It is not at all clear that such advisory groups are
needed either nationally or locally. Whether local advisory groups are needed is a decision best left to the local
land manager. Should the Forest Supervisor determine that an advisory committee would be helpful in achieving the
purposes of the Cave Resources Protection Act, the Department has ample authority and procedures in place to establish
such advisory committees.

3. Scope and Detail of the Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents felt that the proposed rule should have provided more details on how to manage and protect significant
caves. Most of these respondents understood that significant caves would be managed ``to the extent practical''
using current management plans, but wanted the final rule to incorporate or further clarify portions of the proposed
rule. Respondents asked questions such as: how will significant cave listings and significant cave management concerns
be integrated into forest plans; how will specific management concerns about significant caves be identified; how
will ecosystem considerations, including protection of karst features and hydrological recharge areas, be made;
and how will the Forest Service address proposed projects that potentially impact caves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another respondent requested that goals and standards for cave resource protection and management be described
in the rule and that language be added emphasizing that land management decisions should balance consideration of
cave resource protection with consideration of human activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through section 4(c)(1) of the Act, Congress made clear that caves should be managed through the agency's land and
resource management planning process, and not through the significant cave designation process. Section 4(c)(1)
states that significant caves are to be ``.&blank;.&blank;. considered in the preparation of any land management
plan if the preparation or revision of the plan began after the enactment of this Act.'' Forest land and resource management
planning is a continuous, dynamic process which is dependent on monitoring and evaluation of actions taken under
the plan. The agency keeps plans current and updated through amendment or revision and maintains ongoing and meaningful
communication with the public and other government entities. New data such as an inventory of significant caves is
new information that Forest Supervisors consider as forest plans are implemented to determine if forest plan direction
needs to be changed. Designating caves as significant will not automatically trigger the need to amend or revise forest
plans. Upon development of the initial listing of significant caves on National Forest System lands, the Forest Supervisor
will review the forest plan and determine if it is adequate to ensure protection of significant cave resources. If
not, the Supervisor would initiate amendment or revision of the plan to address the protection of significant cave
resources on the forest. The public must be involved in amendment or revision. Thus, any special management concerns
for significant caves, including connected ecosystem considerations, can and should be identified by the public
so that the comments can be analyzed and considered through the forest planning process. The forest planning process
is already adequately regulated by the provisions of 36 CFR part 219; therefore, no additional change to this rule
was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a proposed project might impact a significant cave or cave yet to be evaluated for significance, the effects
of the project would be analyzed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations.
Public input is solicited to identify environmental issues relevant to a proposed action (project).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency policy and procedures under the NEPA in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 require that decision documents (Decision
Memo, Decision Notice, Record of Decision) contain ``Findings required by other laws.'' If a decision affects a significant
cave, a finding will be disclosed describing how the decision considered this cave.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 290.1&blank;Purpose and Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering the general comments on the scope and detail of the regulations addressed in the preceding section
of this preamble, the Department concludes that the proposed rule was confusing in specifying that the initial determination
of significant caves would be made by a special process and that subsequent significant cave determinations would
be made through the forest plan amendment or revision process. The final rule clarifies this concern by: (1) stating
that significant cave resources will be managed pursuant to direction contained in individual forest plans and in
accordance with the policies contained in the Forest Service Directive System and (2) by eliminating any reference
to forest planning in the initial and subsequent listings. This change acknowledges that forest plans provide direction
to manage significant caves but do not contain a list of these caves.

Authorized Officer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents expressed concern over the range of potentially designated authorized officers listed in the
proposed rule. One respondent felt that the authorizing officer should be the Regional Forester while another felt
this authority should not be delegated below the Forest Supervisor level. Another felt the final decision for determining
significant caves should be at a senior management level. Further, some respondents indicated that the authorized
officer should have qualifications and duties related to caves and/or cave resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received on this definition reflect a lack of understanding of how authority is delegated through the
Forest Service. Authority flows from the Chief through Regional Foresters to Forest Supervisors and District Rangers.
These line officers have responsibility for managing all resources, including caves, and will be legally responsible
for complying with this rule and the Act. The agency will delegate that responsibility through the issuance of internal
agency directives and the delegation of authority will vary depending on the significance of the action being assigned.
In general, the authorized officer will refer to the Forest Supervisor who must carry out the evaluations and documentations
required by the rule in the context of forest planning. To avoid confusion, the definition in the final rule does not
include the list of all potential authorized officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Cave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency received a range of opinions on this definition. Some respondents felt the definition was too narrow; others
believed it was too broad. Some respondents, stating that a vug is one resource the Act is intended to protect, were
concerned with the exclusion of vugs from the definition. Individual respondents suggested modifying the definition
to include qualifiers such as: a dark zone; a minimum horizontal or vertical length; absence or presence of an entrance
at any specific time period, and a naturally formed subterranean open area. A couple of respondents were concerned
about the requirement that an individual be able to enter. One felt this precluded passages accessible for small cave
biota. Another felt this requirement may allow for enlarging small openings to make them accessible as caves. One
respondent was concerned that the definition would not protect the ``unnatural'' portion of caves from destruction
or restrict the location of such from the general public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has concluded that the definition in the proposed rule was confusing because it described both the
components of a cave and the features that do not comprise a cave. Accordingly, in the final rule, this definition has
been revised to focus on what a cave is, rather than what it is not. ``Feature'' was replaced with ``opening'' since
it was felt the intent is to include small air passages that extend from the cave itself and that are integral parts of
the cave. This definition encompasses any entranceways, including excavated passage; therefore, the location
and passage associated with the excavated portion is considered under purposes of this Act. While the suggested qualifiers
further define features associated with caves, they were not added because they extend beyond the scope of the cave
definition listed in the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Cave Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some respondents suggested that historical resources be separated from the rest of the resources listed as naturally
occurring. A few respondents noted that speleogens and speleothems should be defined since these terms are not commonly
found in dictionaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``naturally'' was removed as suggested since cultural materials do not occur naturally in caves. Speleogens
and speleothems are not included in the definition in the final rule since they are but a couple of the features that
comprise geologic and mineralogic materials or substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
National Forest System Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents were confused over which lands the Act applied to: non-federal lands on which the agency has planned
projects, private lands with caves affected by agency projects on Federal lands, lands owned in fee title, and/or
National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A definition for ``National Forest System lands'' has been added. This rule applies only to lands managed by and under
the legal jurisdiction of the Forest Service. The Act contains no language extending agency authority to private
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Significant Cave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents noted that this definition should correspond to the criteria listed in proposed section 290.3(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition was revised to include the criteria now in &sect;290.3 (c) and (d).

Vug
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents overlapped their comments on ``vug'' with the ``cave'' definition. A couple of respondents suggested
clarifications to the definition including: Add a size definition other than ``small'' and make clear that a vug is
only a stand-alone cavity presumable intersected by a man-made passage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the only reference to a vug was in the definition of a cave and this reference has now been removed, the separate
definition of a vug is no longer necessary.

Paragraph (a) Nominations for Initial and Subsequent Listings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) provided that the Secretary of Agriculture shall cooperate and consult with the Secretary
of Interior to devise a similar nomination process for initial listing of significant caves and give public notice
of the nomination process. In addition, subsequent determinations of significant caves would be made through the
forest planning process. Many respondents felt that the review of nominations and the determination by the authorized
officer should be conducted in consultation and cooperation with an advisory committee, team, acknowledged experts
in the field of speleology, or appropriate private sector interests, including cavers. A few respondents felt an
appeal process was needed for those caves determined not to be significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph was revised to focus more narrowly on the nomination process, and a new paragraph (b) was added to describe
the evaluation process. The reference in the proposed rule to subsequent determination of significant caves through
the forest planning process has been removed. Determination of significant caves can be made at any time by the authorized
officer. Reference to consultation between the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior was removed since this coordination
has occurred in the writing of the entire rule and through a separate effort to develop a Proposed Procedure for Listing
Significant Caves. Both paragraphs emphasize public and agency input and consultation. Notice of the nomination
procedures for the initial listing must be published in the

. Notice of future listings is not required as the rule provides that the public and government agencies are to submit

Paragraph (c) Criteria for Significant Caves
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents stated that the criteria were too broad; others felt the criteria were too restrictive. Those respondents
who felt the criteria are too broad suggested that criteria be developed at the State-level, be eliminated, or be modified
with a strong emphasis on the cave having an important value. The majority of respondents felt that these criteria
would eliminate the majority of caves from listing as significant. Most requested that criteria be based only on a
cave processing ``one or more of the following features, characteristics, or values.'' Some recommended that the
criteria focus on identifying insignificant caves; thus, managing all others as significant. Individual respondents
identified the need to add new criteria categories for caves of undetermined status, caves with abnormal dangers,
caves with other values, and caves within a special management area which was designated wholly or in part due to the
cave resources found there.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, two business entities felt that the criteria for selection of significant caves are too broad and that
the proposed rule neglected to consider the impacts that such a designation would have on oil and gas production. They
felt that the designation of significant caves needed to be based on caves having an ``important value'', especially
when considering other uses of the land. They recommended that significant cave values be weighed against the economic
values of mineral development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act in section 4(a) requires that the Secretary issue criteria for the identification of significant caves in
regulations. Thus, criteria focusing on insignificant caves or criteria developed at the State level do not address
the Act's mandate. To focus the criteria on an inventory procedure that can be interpreted and more consistently applied
across the agency, the qualifier ``*&blank;*&blank;* which are deemed by the authorized officer to be unusual, significant,
or otherwise meriting special management'' has not been adopted on the final rule. This phrase confused respondents
since it added another level of evaluation and review to the six stated criteria. There is nothing in the Act or its legislative
history that indicates that a cave has to have a value more important than, or be weighed against, other uses of public
lands before being designated significant. The criteria for designating significant caves are identical to those
adopted in the Department of the Interior's final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Biota.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All respondents commenting on this paragraph requested modifications to make the criteria less restrictive. They
recommended the removal of qualifiers such as ``cave dependent,'' ``that occur in large numbers or variety,'' and
``disturbance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Cave dependent'' was replaced with ``seasonal or yearlong'' to better describe the conditions under which biota
use a cave. The qualifier ``*&blank;*&blank;* occur in large numbers or variety *&blank;*&blank;*'' was removed
because caves typically contain small populations and variety of flora and fauna by the very nature of the cave environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cultural.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All respondents commenting on this paragraph felt the criterion was too restrictive to include potentially eligible
sites, religious sites for native Americans, caves mined for saltpeter, and sites with ethnographic or historic
associations with events or persons considered important to local communities or social groups. A few suggested
eliminating the requirement that the site be eligible for or listed on the National Register or Historic Places.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph was clarified to address and refer to the terms ``historic or prehistoric'' that are already defined
through other laws and regulations. These terms encompass ``cultural'' resources better than historical properties
and archaeological resources. The paragraph also was expanded to better describe the types of resources that could
be included or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places based on the cave itself or the contents
contained within. The paragraph as revised encompasses religious sites for native Americans, caves mined for saltpeter,
and other sites with ethnographic or historic associations. Allowing for a site to be eligible for or listed on the
National Register of Historic Places consistently ties to the agency management of cultural resources.

Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents felt that the terms ``outstanding'' and ``important'' were too restrictive. Most recommended that
``outstanding'' be replaced with ``other interesting'' or that it and ``important'' be deleted completely. Several
respondents felt these criteria would allow every cave to be determined significant. One recommended that this paragraph
be completely eliminated; another recommended tying the criteria to only ``fragile or outstanding'' examples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule the qualifiers ``outstanding'', ``useful'' and ``important'' have been eliminated and replaced
with more tangible terms. However, while some restrictive qualifiers have been expanded, there are still qualifiers
that could appropriately eliminate caves from listing under this criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrologic. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent felt this criterion should be limited to waters that are necessary to maintain municipal water supplies
and maintain scientifically important biota or cave features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department disagrees. This criterion is adopted without change from the proposed rule since it addresses hydrological
resources associated with caves and cave resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recreational. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most respondents requested that ``challenge'' be replaced and values such as wilderness, sporting, natural, aesthetic,
exploration, educational, and scientific be substituted. One respondent felt that this section should be completely
removed. Another noted that scenic values and challenge must have an important value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion responds to the Act which recognizes caves for their perpetual use, enjoyment, and benefit for all
people and further notes that people utilize caves for recreational purposes. The qualifier ``by virtue of challenge''
has been eliminated since it does not describe a type of recreational opportunity that can be measured. In the final
rule, this paragraph is written broadly enough to incorporate the suggested values of wilderness, sporting, aesthetic,
and exploration if they tie to recreational and scenic opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational or scientific. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent noted that any new cave discoveries would automatically qualify as significant under this proposed
criterion. Several other respondents felt that qualifiers should be deleted to make the criteria less restrictive.
One suggested adding wilderness and uniqueness to this category. Other felt that these criteria must either note
an important value or it should be removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to this paragraph in the final rule are minor. ``Contemporary'' is inserted before ``human disturbance''
to ensure that cultural resources are considered rather than recent acts of vandalism. New cave discoveries could
be designated significant if they lack evidence of contemporary human disturbance or impact. This acknowledges
that a pristine cave offers potential values from a scientific, educational, and recreational standpoint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specially designated areas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has been added to recognize that some management decisions have already been made wholly or in part due to caves. Where
special management designations are already associated with protecting caves, it is efficient to designate them
as significant without re-evaluating them under the requirements of paragraph (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e) Designation and Documentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents felt clarification was needed for the authorized officer's designation of significant caves.
They felt that designation should be tied to the authorized officer confirming that a cave met one of the criteria rather
than evaluating the criteria itself. Another respondent requested that the rule be specific as to what information
must be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wording of this paragraph in the final rule clarifies that the authorized officer will confirm whether or not a
cave meets one of the criteria listed in &sect;290.3(c). This clearly defines the role of authorized officer as a decisionmaker
not a reviewer of the criteria. The paragraph also specifies the minimum documentation to be retained for each cave
designated as significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (f), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Undiscovered passages,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been added to clearly recognize that once a cave has been listed, the designation applies to the entire cave on federal
land, regardless of agency jurisdiction or extent of exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A decision to place a cave on the significant cave list is an inventory type decision, and as such, is not appropriately
subject to administrative appeal. Accordingly, new paragraph (g), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Decision final
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has been added to clearly state that this determination is not subject to appeal. However, paragraph (a) of this section
of the final rule contains a new sentence that makes explicit that a nomination may be resubmitted for listing, thus
acknowledging that a decision not to list a cave may be changed when better or new information accompanies the nomination.

Section 290.4&blank;Confidentiality of Cave Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of respondents focused on three concerns:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the confidentiality language of the proposed rule went beyond the intent of the Act. They specifically noted
that the provisions were to apply only to cave locations, not other cave information. Further, they felt that these
provisions would inhibit exchange of information between the caving community and the Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That caves not designated significant have their locations protected under confidentiality provisions. Otherwise,
all information about that cave would become public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That denial of cave location information be subject to appeal. A couple of respondents noted that the requirements
for requesting information differed between the FS proposed rule and the USDI proposed rule. Two others expressed
the concern that without knowing the exact location of a cave, it is impossible for a mineral lessee to know whether
the cave will affect his lease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) has been revised to indicate that only location information will be held confidential, but other specific
information could be withheld if, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it would reveal the location of a cave.
Locational information for all caves will be protected until the designation decision is made. This protection will
continue for caves listed as significant. The information submitted for caves that are not listed will be returned
to the person or organization submitting the nomination. Consequently, the responsibility for maintaining the
confidentiality of unlisted caves will rest with the originator of the information and not with the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of this section has procedures to request confidential information, and has been rewritten to be identical
to the language adopted by the USDI in its final rule for uniformity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c), which states the decision regarding access to information is not appealable, has been retained. The
Act provides specific exemption from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. It is the Department's determination
that the appeal process would not further public interest in protecting cave information. A procedure exists to permit
the release of cave locations. The authorized officer will release cave location information based on a written request
and a determination that the request would further the purposes of the Act and would not create a substantial risk of
harm, theft, or destruction of such cave.

Implementation of Proposed Prohibitions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent was confused by the prohibitions. Concern was expressed that some additional action must occur for
the prohibition to take effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prohibitions applying to National Forest System lands are separated into three Subparts: General Prohibitions;
Prohibitions in Areas Designated by Order; and Prohibitions in Regions. General Prohibitions are enforced on all
National Forest System lands and do not require any formal posting. Prohibitions in Areas Designated by Order require
an additional action to inform a forest visitor. The order must be posted in accordance with 261.51 of this chapter.

8 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of the current rulemaking was to establish the criteria for significant caves. Where it was expedient
to make minor adjustments to existing prohibitions in order to help protect significant cave resources, this was
also done. If experience with administering significant cave resources shows additional regulations and penalties
are needed, subsequent rulemaking specific to those management concerns will be undertaken.

Respondents were concerned that this prohibition would not allow a gate to be installed if it was needed to protect
a species, including those listed as threatened or endangered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paragraph was modified to address this concern by adding ``.&blank;.&blank;. except as authorized to protect
a cave resource.'' A gate was not specifically cited since there may be other types of installations that could curtail
the movement of cave life to protect a cave resource.

Section 261.9(j)&blank;Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents were confused by the intent of this paragraph. One asked whether enlarging a naturally occurring
cave passage or entrance would require a special use authorization. Another requested clarification stating that
a special use authorization cannot permit damage to, or excavation of, a significant cave. One respondent suggested
adding a new prohibition to address section 7(a)(2) of the Act dealing with possessing, consuming, selling, bartering,
or exchanging any cave resource without authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(1) of the Act states that activities that may lead to destroying altering, or removing of cave resources
or interfering with free movement of plant or animal life may only be permitted with prior authorization. Thus, any
excavation of a cave passage or entrance would have to be approved by a special use authorization. A special use authorization
permitting excavation in a cave is site-specific, thus, this provision does not encourage nor allow blanket approval
for this type of activity for all caves on a given forest. A clause has been added prohibiting the removal of any cave
resource for commercial purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed wording has been retained. The cave entrance area is protected by the existing wording in paragraphs
(d)(1) and (d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (n) was added to specifically address the discharge of fireworks. No existing prohibition addressed
this human safety concern.

Section 261.58(ee)&blank;Occupancy and Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most respondents requested that ``litter'' be incorporated into this clause. A couple of respondents felt that additional
wording was needed to allow cavers to bring and remove their own receptacles. Another respondent recommended that
fluid wastes be considered on a cave by cave basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 11(b) of this section already prohibits ``Possessing or leaving .&blank;.&blank;. litter in an exposed
or unsanitary condition.'' Current wording does not specify who must provide the receptacles; therefore, it can
be interpreted that cavers may bring in and remove their own receptacles. Since this prohibition is applicable to
a specific area designated through an order by the Forest Supervisor, there is the flexibility to add an exception
for a particular cave to only prohibit solid wastes.

Regulatory Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
nor State or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise
new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this final rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), and
it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as defined by that Act. To the extent that small entities engaged in resource extraction activities may have
to site operations to protect significant caves, these requirements are the minimum necessary to protect the public
interest, and are well within the capability of small entities to perform.

of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest Service received approval from the Office of Management and Budget to collect
cave nomination information and confidential cave information. The agency estimates that each person will spend
an average of three hours per response for a cave nomination and one-half hour per response for the confidential cave
information request.

The rules of this part implement the requirements of the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 4301&hyph;4309),
hereafter referred to as the ``Act''. The rules apply to cave management on National Forest System lands. These rules,
in conjunction with rules in part 261 of this chapter, provide the basis for identifying and managing significant
caves on National Forest System lands in accordance with the Act. National Forest System lands will be managed in a
manner which, to the extent practical, protects and maintains significant cave resources in accordance with the
policies outlined in the Forest Service Directive System and the management direction contained in the individual
forest plans.

Act of 1980 as amended (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest Service has received approval by the Office of Management and Budget
to collect cave nomination information under clearance number 0596&hyph;0123 and confidential information under
0596&hyph;0122. The information provided for the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be listed
as ``significant'' and the information in the requests to obtain confidential cave information will be used to decide
whether to grant access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is voluntary. No action may
be taken against a person for refusing to supply the information requested. Response to the information requirements
for obtaining confidential cave information is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with section 5 of the Federal
Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4304).

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends Postal Service regulations on forfeiture procedures by removing the provision requiring
the agency to provide a receipt of the inventory of the property seized for forfeiture to the party whose property was
seized within 10 days of the seizure. This amendment is intended to make the inventory notice precedure of the Postal
Service consistent with other federal agencies and to eliminate an unnecessary burden on the agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Postal Service regulations concerning inventory procedures for property seized for forfeiture are published in
title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as &sect;233.7(c). The last sentence of that section establishes
a 10-day maximum period for the agency to give a written receipt of the inventory of the property seized for forfeiture
and the identity of the Postal Inspector who conducted the seizure to the party from whom the property was seized. Section
233.7(c) is amended to remove the 10-day limit to make the inventory notice procedure of the Postal Service consistent
with other federal agencies and to eliminate an unnecessary burden on the agency when the party whose property was
seized cannot be readily identified.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63316), EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine. The NPR proposed approval of several regulations adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State of Maine which require the implementation of RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various types of VOC sources. No public comments were received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, ozone nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were required to adopt RACT rules for sources of VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued three sets of control technique guidelines (CTGs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents, establishing a ``presumptive norm'' for RACT for various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of VOC sources. The three sets of CTGs were: (1) Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I_issued before January 1978 (15 CTGs); (2) Group II_issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1978 (9 CTGs); and (3) Group III_issued in the early 1980's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 CTGs). Those sources not covered by a CTG were called non-CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. EPA determined that the area's SIP-approved attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date established which RACT rules the area needed to adopt and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement. Under section 172(a)(1), ozone nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were generally required to attain the ozone standard by December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31, 1982. Those areas that submitted an attainment demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projecting attainment by that date were required to adopt RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources covered by the Group I and II CTGs. Those areas that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sought an extension of the attainment date under section 172(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to as late as December 31, 1987 were required to adopt RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all CTG sources and for all major (i.e., 100 ton per year or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of VOC emissions) non-CTG sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, Maine was designated as rural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment and, therefore, was required to adopt regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the Group I and Group II CTGs for major sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on monitored ozone exceedances in Maine, EPA notified the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governor of Maine on May 25, 1988 and November 8, 1988 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the 1977 CAA were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended Section 182(a)(2)(A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that pre-enactment ozone nonattainment areas that retained
their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of nonattainment and were classified as marginal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above fix their deficient RACT rules for ozone by May 15, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the amended CAA, two counties in Maine were classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as marginal (these two counties constitute one marginal ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment area) and seven counties in Maine were classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate (these seven counties constitute three moderate ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment areas). 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991). The State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted revisions to meet the RACT fix-up requirement and EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved these revisions to the Maine SIP on February 3, 1992 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 22, 1993 (57 FR 3946 and 58 FR 15281).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(b)(2) of the amended Act requires States to adopt RACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for all areas designated nonattainment for ozone and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as moderate or above. There are three parts to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 182(b)(2) RACT requirement: (1) RACT for sources covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an existing CTG_i.e., a CTG issued prior to the enactment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAAA of 1990; (2) RACT for sources covered by a post-enactment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CTG; and (3) all major sources not covered by a CTG, i.e., non-CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. This RACT requirement which applies to nonattainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas that previously were exempt from certain RACT requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires areas to ``catch up'' to those nonattainment areas that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
became subject to those requirements during an earlier period. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, it requires newly designated ozone nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adopt RACT rules consistent with those for previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated nonattainment areas. As previously mentioned, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State of Maine contains three moderate ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These areas are thus subject to the section 182(b)(2) RACT catch-up requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the State of Maine is located in the Northeast Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Region (OTR). The entire State is, therefore, subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 184(b) of the amended CAA. Section 184(b) requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that RACT be implemented for all VOC sources covered by a CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued before or after the enactment of the CAAA of 1990 and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all major VOC sources (defined as 50 tons per year or greater for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources in the OTR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Maine had previously submitted regulations for bulk gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals, fixed roof petroleum tanks, and paper coating sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the RACT fix-up requirement, in order to meet the RACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catch-up requirement, the State must, therefore, adopt regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or affirm that no sources exist) for the remaining 26 CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories as well as adopt rules for all major non-CTG sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Rules for non-CTG sources are not part of this SIP revision and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be further discussed in this document).

In response to the RACT catch-up requirement, on May 14, 1992 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 12, 1992, Maine submitted negative declarations for the CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Surface coating of coils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Large petroleum dry cleaners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through the negative declaration, the State of Maine is asserting that there are no sources within the State that would
be subject to a rule for that source category. EPA is approving this negative declaration submittal as meeting the
section 182(b)(2) and section 184(b) RACT requirements for the source categories listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After submitting the above negative declarations, Maine then proceeded with the process of adopting regulations
to control the remaining CTG categories which include surface coating processes, solvent metal cleaning, graphic
arts operations, the use of cutback asphalt, and gasoline marketing operations. Maine's gasoline marketing RACT
catch-up regulations are not a part of this SIP revision, and will not be further discussed in this notice.

Chapter 129: Surface Coating Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation contains requirements for limiting the VOC emissions from the surface coating of cans, fabric, vinyl,
metal furniture, flatwood paneling, and miscellaneous metal parts and products. Surface coating facilities may

EPA has evaluated Maine's VOC regulations and has found that they are consistent with EPA model regulations and the
applicable CTG documents. As such, EPA believes that the submitted rules constitute RACT for the applicable sources.
By this action, EPA is approving Maine's submittal as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(2) and 184(b)(1)(B)
for the applicable VOC sources. Maine's regulations and EPA's evaluation are detailed in a memorandum, dated July
16, 1993, entitled ``Technical Support Document_Maine_VOC RACT Catch-ups.'' Copies of that document are available,
upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving Maine's Chapter 100 ``Definitions Regulation,'' Chapter 129 ``Surface Coating Facilities,''
Chapter 130 ``Solvent Degreasers,'' Chapter 131 ``Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt,'' and Chapter 132 ``Graphic
Arts-Rotogravure and Flexography'' as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(2) and 184(b) of the CAA for the
following categories of VOC sources: the surface coating of cans, fabric, vinyl, metal furniture, flatwood paneling,
and miscellaneous metal parts and products; solvent metal cleaning; the use of cutback asphalt; and rotogravure
and flexographic printing operations. EPA is also approving the negative declarations submitted by the State of
Maine as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(2) and 184(b) of the CAA for the 15 source categories for which
negative declarations were submitted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result,
the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the procedures published in
the

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which
superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') is today 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publishing an interpretive rule regarding roof removal operations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants for Asbestos (``Asbestos NESHAP''). The purpose of the interpretive rule is to clarify the Asbestos
NESHAP as it affects roof removal operations by: specifying which roof removal operations EPA construes the NESHAP
to cover; and specifying roof removal work practices that EPA deems to be in compliance with the NESHAP in roofing operations
where the NESHAP applies.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 20, 1990, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 48406) revisions to the Asbestos NESHAP, which is codified at 40 CFR part 61, subpart M. Members of the roofing
industry have expressed confusion regarding the asbestos NESHAP and have requested clarification from EPA with
regard to how compliance with the NESHAP can be achieved for roof removal operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today publishing, as a new appendix A to subpart M of 40 CFR part 61, the interpretive rule that is set forth below.
The purpose of the interpretive rule is to clarify the Asbestos NESHAP as it affects roof removal operations by: (i)
Specifying which roof removal operations EPA construes the NESHAP to cover; and (ii) specifying roof removal work
practices that EPA deems to be in compliance with the NESHAP in roofing operations where the NESHAP applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new appendix A to the Asbestos NESHAP does not supersede, alter or replace the Asbestos NESHAP; nor does it change
the scope or stringency of the NESHAP. Rather appendix A interprets the NESHAP as it applies to roof removal operations,
in order to provide particularized guidance which, if followed, would promote compliance with, and more effective
and consistent enforcement of, the NESHAP in such operations. This interpretive rule is intended as guidance to the
roofing industry and the public and does not constitute an action which is subject to judicial review under section
307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), or under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704. In addition,
because the rule prescribed in this notice is an interpretive rule and does not promulgate or revise a standard or regulation
listed in section 307(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)), the procedural requirements for rulemaking
under the Clean Air Act and the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to this action. See 42 U.S.C. 7607(d); 5 U.S.C.
553(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the present intent of EPA that if this interpretive rule is revoked or withdrawn before new regulations regarding
asbestos emissions or work practices for handling of asbestos containing materials during roof removal operations
under the Clean Air Act are promulgated by EPA, then EPA shall replace the interpretive rule with another interpretation
or guidance document that would address how the NESHAP applies to roof removal in renovation and demolition operations.
It is also the present intent of EPA that prior to replacing or substantially revising this interpretive rule, EPA
would consult with the public regarding such action.

I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more than one percent asbestos as determined using
the methods specified in appendix A, subpart F, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy. The NESHAP
classifies ACM as either ``friable'' or ``nonfriable''. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized
or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced
to powder by hand pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II
ACM are distinguished from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing
gaskets, packings, resilient floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing products containing
more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-containing
single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof
coatings and mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products that use other bituminous or
resinous binders (such as coal tars or pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM includes all
other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing
more than one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely to become friable when damaged
than is Category I ACM. The applicability of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of the material
at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3)
the amount of ACM involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is referred to as ``regulated asbestos-containing
material'' (RACM). RACM is defined in &sect;61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable asbestos-containing
material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will
be sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that has already been or is likely to become crumbled,
pulverized, or reduced to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a renovation or demolition
operation, then all friable ACM in the operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, are
subject to the NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family homes or on residential buildings containing four
or fewer dwelling units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the total asbestos-containing
roof area undergoing renovation is less than 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its
condition (friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that
damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating blade
(RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable
asbestos-containing roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of that material will create 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, ``RB roof cutter'' means an engine-powered roof cutting machine
with one or more rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with blades having sharp or tapered
edges, and/or which does not use a rotating blade, is used for ``slicing'' rather than ``cutting'' the roofing material;
such equipment is not included in the term ``RB roof cutter''.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an
RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing
roofing material, any project that is 5580 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or greater is subject to the NESHAP; conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment
that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing
material in a roof removal project that is less than 5580 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the project is not subject to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for demolitions. EPA further
construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on Category
I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the area of roof to be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II roofing material), if the area of the roofing material
to be removed is at least 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the removal methods will crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from other ACM that has
been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or
other Category II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the removal is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, except that notification is always
required for demolitions. 40 CFR 61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing
roofing material as little as possible. If A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without
160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other
ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not subject to the NESHAP, even where
the total area of the roofing material to be removed exceeds 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
; provided, however, that if the renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal operation
is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation activities exceeds 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore,
to determine if a removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is subject to the NESHAP, any suspect
roofing material (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
roofing material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such roofing material contains more than one
percent asbestos and if the removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified and the work practices
in &sect;61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of
suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for asbestos if the contractor follows the notification
and work practice requirements of the NESHAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. A/C Shingle Removal (Category II ACM Removal) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.B.1. A/C shingles, which are Category II nonfriable ACM, become regulated ACM if the material has a high probability
of becoming or has become crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by the forces expected to act on the material in
the course of demolition or renovation operations. 40 CFR 61.141. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, merely breaking an A/C shingle (or any other category II ACM) that is not friable may not necessarily cause
the material to become RACM. A/C shingles are typically nailed to buildings on which they are attached. EPA believes
that the extent of breakage that will normally result from carefully removing A/C shingles and lowering the shingles
to the ground will not result in crumbling, pulverizing or reducing the shingles to powder. Conversely, the extent
of breakage that will normally occur if the A/C shingles are dropped from a building or scraped off of a building with
heavy machinery would cause the shingles to become RACM. EPA therefore construes the NESHAP to mean that the removal
of A/C shingles that are not friable, using methods that do not crumble, pulverize, or reduce the A/C shingles to powder
(such as pry bars, spud bars and shovels to carefully pry the material), is not subject to the NESHAP provided that the
A/C shingles are properly handled during and after removal, as discussed in this paragraph and the asbestos NESHAP.
This interpretation also applies to other Category II nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Cutting vs. Slicing and Manual Methods for Removal of Category I ACM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.C.1. Because of damage to the roofing material, and the potential for fiber release, roof removal operations using
rotating blade (RB) roof cutters or other equipment that sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material are subject to
the NESHAP. As EPA interprets the NESHAP, the use of certain manual methods (using equipment such as axes, hatchets,
or knives, spud bars, pry bars, and shovels, but not saws) or methods that slice, shear, or punch (using equipment such
as a power slicer or power plow) does not constitute ``cutting, sanding, grinding or abrading.'' This is because these
methods do not destroy the structural matrix or integrity of the material such that the material is crumbled, pulverized
or reduced to powder. Hence, it is EPA's interpretation that when such methods are used, assuming the roof material
is not friable, the removal operation is not subject to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.C.2. Power removers or power tear-off machines are typically used to pry the roofing material up from the deck after
the roof membrane has been cut. It is EPA's interpretation that when these machines are used to pry roofing material
up, their use is not regulated by the NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.C.3. As noted previously, the NESHAP only applies to the removal of asbestos-containing roofing materials. Thus,
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP does not apply to the use of RB cutters to remove non-asbestos built up roofing (BUR). On roofs containing some

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing and some non-asbestos containing materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under the NESHAP depends on the methods used to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each type of material in addition to other coverage thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified above. For example, it is not uncommon for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roofs to be made of non-asbestos BUR and base flashings that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain asbestos. In that situation, EPA construes the NESHAP to be inapplicable to the removal of the non-asbestos
BUR using an RB cutter so long as the RB cutter is not used to cut 5580 ft2 or more of the asbestos-containing base flashing
or other asbestos-containing material into sections. In addition, the use of methods that slice, shear, punch or
pry could then be used to remove the asbestos flashings and not trigger coverage under the NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. Notification for a demolition is always required under the NESHAP. However, EPA believes that few roof removal
jobs constitute ``demolitions'' as defined in the NESHAP (&sect;61.141). In particular, it is EPA's view that the
removal of roofing systems (i.e., the roof membrane, insulation, surfacing, coatings, flashings, mastic, shingles,
and felt underlayment), when such removal is not a part of a demolition project, constitutes a ``renovation'' under
the NESHAP. If the operation is a renovation, and Category I roofing material is being removed using either manual
methods or slicing, notification is not required by the NESHAP. If Category II material is not friable and will be removed
without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, no notification is required. Also, if the renovation involves
less than the threshold area for applicability as discussed above, then no notification is required. However, if
a roof removal meets the applicability and threshold requirements under the NESHAP, then EPA (or the delegated agency)
must be notified in advance of the removal in accordance with the requirements of &sect;61.145(b), as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Notification must be given in writing at least 10 working days in advance and must include the information in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;61.145(b)(4), except for emergency renovations as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The notice must be updated as necessary, including, for example, when the amount of asbestos-containing roofing
material reported changes by 20 percent or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA must be notified if the start date of the roof removal changes. If the start date of a roof removal project
is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed to an earlier date, EPA must be provided with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written notice of the new start date at least 10 working days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in advance. If the start date changes to a later date, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be notified by telephone as soon as possible before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original start date and a written notice must be sent as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;For emergency renovations (as defined in &sect;61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety
or public health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the notification must be postmarked
or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, but no later than the following work day.

A. Requirements to Adequately Wet and Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No Visible Emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal operations include requirements that the affected
material be adequately wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of properly. The requirements
for disposal of waste materials are discussed separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements
discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section
I above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation (&sect;&sect;61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires
that RACM be adequately wet (as defined in &sect;61.141) during the operation that damages or disturbs the asbestos
material until collected for disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to
remove Category I asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements of &sect;61.145(c)
apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the ``adequately
wet'' and ``discharge no visible emission'' requirements of the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated
with the following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface;
and (2) a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in operation during the
cutting of the roof.

B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may not be required during the cutting of Category
I asbestos roofing material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with &sect;61.145(c)(3)(i),
that wetting will unavoidably damage the building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard
while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, the roof removal operation will be exempted
from the requirement to wet during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to base such a decision.
Before proceeding with a dry removal, the contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions
will be made on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the wetting requirements are not necessary. Where
EPA grants an exemption from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage to equipment within
the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP specifies alternative control methods (&sect;61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)).
Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do
not produce visible emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements
of &sect;61.152, or (c) other methods that have received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative
emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has received written approval from EPA and the
method is being implemented consistent with the approved procedures (&sect;61.145(c)(3)(ii) or &sect;61.152(b)(3)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is
below freezing, as specified in &sect;61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated as the reason for not
wetting, records must be kept of the temperature at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not performed
and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 years. 42 CFR &sect;61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation
that in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the Administrator is needed for using emission
control methods listed in &sect;61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that have been previously
approved by the Administrator. However, such written application or approval is required for alternative emission
control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and debris collected from cutting must still be kept
wet and placed in containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste disposal would continue to
apply as described elsewhere in this notice and the Asbestos NESHAP.

C. Waste Collection and Handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand
or abrade Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the NESHAP and can be disposed
of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material (such as
A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from
the removal is not subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets the NESHAP to be inapplicable
to waste resulting from roof removal operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described in section
I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal regulations may apply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or other method that similarly damages the roofing material,
is used to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material from the cut (the sawdust or debris)
is considered asbestos containing waste subject to &sect;61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage thresholds
discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated
in accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free
of the sawdust and debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is collected as discussed below in paragraphs
3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste because it is considered
to be Category I nonfriable material (as long as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is
Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material).
EPA further believes that if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and be handled in accordance with
&sect;61.150. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the
roofing material) to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and debris resulting from the
cutting of the roof should be collected as soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until collected
and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends
down close to the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard,
and the spraying device is in operation during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be confined
along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or
vacuum up the damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector that
meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the bulk of
the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of
the remainder of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate roofs), sweeping up the debris and
then wet wiping the surface may be done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that if these decontamination
procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos
waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination procedures are followed, if the remaining
portions of the roof are non-asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the remaining portions are
removed using removal methods that slice, shear, punch or pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining
portions do not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately
wet requirements are not applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's interpretation, the failure
of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material created
by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste,
provided that such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by gentle sweeping) and disposed
of as asbestos waste. Other methods of decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local delegated
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is not collected immediately, it will be necessary
to lightly mist the dust or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in containers. The dust or
debris should be lightly misted frequently enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne emissions,
prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed,
the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining
roof material is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not
further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation,
and provided the roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the appearance of rough, jagged
or damaged edges on the remaining roofing material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that such remaining
roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if
the sawdust or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3,
3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such material ``friable''
for purposes of this interpretive rule or the NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting
operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting
operation. Where roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of the RB cutter (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 where such remaining roofing material near the cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand
pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant will ensure that such friable material need not
be treated or disposed of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied to the friable material
after the roofing material has been collected into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's
view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is followed in operations where roofing material
near the cutline has been rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the decontamination procedures set
forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements would
be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the remaining roofing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debris from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as plastic bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have labels that identify the waste generator (such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name of the roofing contractor, abatement contractor, and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building owner or operator) and the location of the site at which the waste was generated.

4.A.1. Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical, all collected dust and debris from cutting as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any contaminated roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in accordance with &sect;61.154 or
to an EPA-approved site that converts asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with &sect;61.155. During
the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning signs must be affixed to the vehicles.

4.B.2. The waste generator is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the WSR is delivered to the disposal site along
with the waste shipment. If a copy of the WSR signed by the disposal site operator is not returned to the waste generator
within 35 days, the waste generator must contact the transporter and/or the disposal site to determine the status
of the waste shipment. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(3). If the signed WSR is not received within 45 days, the waste generator must
report, in writing, to the responsible NESHAP program agency and send along a copy of the WSR. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(4).
Copies of WSRs, including those signed by the disposal site operator, must be retained for at least 2 years. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
5.1. For those roof removals that are subject to the NESHAP, at least one on-site supervisor trained in the provisions
of the NESHAP must be present during the removal of the asbestos roofing material. 40 CFR 61.145(c)(8). In EPA's view,
this person can be a job foreman, a hired consultant, or someone who can represent the building owner or contractor
responsible for the removal. In addition to the initial training requirement, a refresher training course is required
every 2 years. The NESHAP training requirements became effective on November 20, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2. Asbestos training courses developed specifically to address compliance with the NESHAP in roofing work, as
well as courses developed for other purposes can satisfy this requirement of the NESHAP, as long as the course covers
the areas specified in the regulation. EPA believes that Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) training
courses will, for example, satisfy the NESHAP training requirements. However, nothing in this interpretive rule
or in the NESHAP shall be deemed to require that roofing contractors or roofing workers performing operations covered
by the NESHAP must be trained or accredited under AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization
Act (ASHARA). Likewise, state or local authorities may independently impose additional training, licensing, or
accreditation requirements on roofing contractors performing operations covered by the NESHAP, but such additional
training, licensing or accreditation is not called for by this interpretive rule or the federal NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.3. For removal of Category I asbestos containing roofing material where RB roof cutters or equipment that similarly
damages the asbestos-containing roofing material are used, the NESHAP training requirements (&sect;61.145(c)(8))
apply as discussed in Section I above. It is EPA's intention that removal of Category I asbestos-containing roofing
material using hatchets, axes, knives, and/or the use of spud bars, pry bars and shovels to lift the roofing material,
or similar removal methods that slice, punch, or shear the roof membrane are not subject to the training requirements,
since these methods do not cause the roof removal to be subject to the NESHAP. Likewise, it is EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intention that roof removal operations involving Category II nonfriable ACM are not subject to the training requirements
where such operations are not subject to the NESHAP as discussed in section I above.

marking, for Model Year 1995. This action is pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, which
provides that NHTSA select high-theft lines, with the agreement of the manufacturer, if possible. This final listing
is intended to inform the public, particularly law enforcement groups, of the car lines that are subject to the parts-marking
requirements of the theft prevention standard for Model Year 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 49 CFR part 541, sets forth requirements for inscribing or affixing
identification numbers onto covered original equipment major parts, and the replacement parts for those original
equipment parts, on all vehicles in lines selected as high-theft lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 603(a)(2) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2023(a)(2)) (hereinafter ``the
Cost Savings Act'') specifies that NHTSA shall select the high-theft lines, with the agreement of the manufacturer,
if possible. Section 603(d) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2023(d)) provides that once a line has been designated
as a high-theft line, it remains subject to the theft prevention standard unless that line is exempted under section
605 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2025). Section 605 provides that a manufacturer may petition to have a high theft
line exempted from the requirements of section 602, if the line is equipped with an antitheft device as standard equipment.
The exemption is granted if NHTSA determines that the antitheft device is likely to be as effective as compliance with
the theft prevention standard in reducing and deterring motor vehicle thefts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency annually publishes the names of the lines which were previously listed as high-theft lines and of the lines
which are being listed for the first time and will be subject to the theft prevention standard beginning with Model
Year 1995. It also identifies those car lines that are exempted from the theft prevention standard for the 1995 model
year because of standard equipment antitheft devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Model Year 1995, two car lines, the General Motors Oldsmobile Toronado and the Mazda Amati 800 were renamed as the
Oldsmobile Aurora and the Mazda Millenia, respectively. Also, the Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow have been renamed
the Plymouth and Dodge Neon car lines. These two lines were listed in the MY 1994 Final Listing of High Theft Lines. Unfortunately,
Chrysler did not inform the agency of the new nameplates for these lines until after the publication of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63296), announcing the high-theft lines. This name change became effective beginning with the 1994 model year.
The updated list reflects these name changes. Additionally, for Model Year 1995, the agency selected seven new car
lines, in accordance with the procedures published in 49 CFR part 542, as likely to be high-theft lines. The newly selected
lines are: The Chrysler Cirrus, Chrysler Sebring, Dodge Avenger, Dodge Stratus, Honda Acura (nameplate to be announced),
Subaru Legacy, which was erroneously listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63298) as a new car line for MY 1994, and the Toyota Avalon. In addition to these seven lines, the list of high-theft
lines includes all those lines that were selected as high-theft lines and listed for prior model years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of exempted lines includes five high-theft lines exempted by the Agency, beginning with Model Year 1995,
from the parts-marking requirements of part 541. The five car lines exempted in full are the Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile
Aurora, Mazda Millenia, Volkswagen Cabriolet, and Volkswagen Corrado. Additionally, Toyota requested that the
agency lists its Lexus car lines without its 3-digit engine identifier. Therefore, the updated list reflects this
request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The car lines listed as being subject to the parts-marking standard have previously been selected as high-theft lines
in accordance with the procedures of 49 CFR part 542 and section 603 of the Cost Savings Act. Under these procedures,
manufacturers evaluate new car lines to conclude whether those new lines are likely to be high-theft lines. Manufacturers
submit these evaluations and conclusions to the agency, which makes an independent evaluation, and, on a preliminary
basis, determines whether the new line should be subject to parts marking. NHTSA informs the manufacturer in writing
of its evaluations and determinations, together with the factual information considered by the agency in making
them. The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider these preliminary determinations. Within 60 days of
the receipt of the request, NHTSA makes its final determination. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of these
determinations and its response to the request for reconsideration. If there is no request for reconsideration,
the agency's determination becomes final 45 days after sending the letter with the preliminary determination. Each
of the new car lines on the high-theft list is the subject of a prior final determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the car lines listed as being exempt from the standard have previously been exempted in accordance with
the procedures of 49 CFR part 543 and section 605 of the Cost Savings Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NHTSA finds for good cause that notice and opportunity for comment on these listings are unnecessary.
Further, public comment on the listings of selections and exemptions is not contemplated by Title VI, and is unnecessary
since the selections and exemptions have previously been made in accordance with the statutory criteria and procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons, since this revised listing only informs the public of previous agency actions and does not impose
any additional obligations on any party, NHTSA finds for good cause that the amendment made by this notice should be
effective as soon as it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register

1. Costs and Other Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this rule and determined that is not ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has also considered this notice under Executive Order 12866. As already
noted, the selections in this final rule have previously been made in accordance with the provisions of the Cost Savings
Act, and the manufacturers of the selected lines have already been informed that those lines are subject to the requirements
of part 541 for Model Year 1995. Further, this listing does not actually exempt lines from the requirements of part
541; it only informs the general public of all such previously granted exemptions. Since the only purpose of this final
listing is to inform the public of prior action for Model Year 1995, a full regulatory evaluation has not been prepared.

2. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also considered the effects of this listing under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As noted above,
the effect of this final rule is simply to inform the public of those lines that are subject to the requirements of part
541 for Model Year 1995. The agency believes that listing of this information will not have any economic impact on small
entities.

3. Environmental Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule, and determined that it will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this final rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Civil Justice Reform
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not have a retroactive effect and it does not preempt any state law. Section 613 of the Motor Vehicle
Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2030) provides that judicial review of this rule may be obtained pursuant
to section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004). The Cost Savings Act does not require submission of a petition
for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1988 amendments to the MMPA directed the Secretary of Commerce to implement an interim exemption from the general
prohibition on taking marine mammals in the MMPA for certain incidental takings by commercial fishermen during the
period November 23, 1988, through October 1, 1993, while a permanent regime to govern interactions between marine
mammals and commercial fishing operations was developed. Congress subsequently extended the interim exemption
until May 1, 1994. For background on this issue, refer to earlier regulatory actions (56 FR 23958, May 24, 1991; 57 FR
59832, December 16, 1992; 58 FR 51788, October 5, 1993; and 59 FR 17048, April 11, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MMPA Amendments of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;238, among other things, amended the MMPA by adding a new section
118 to establish a permanent regime to govern interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations.
Section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994 amended section 114(a) of the MMPA to extend the interim exemption through
September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under new section 118 implementing the new regime,
whichever is earlier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to an administrative delay, 50 CFR part 229, the regulations implementing the interim exemption, expired on May
1, 1994, and now must be reissued. This final rule reinstates those regulations until September 1, 1995, unless they
are superseded earlier by regulations implementing new section 118. The reissued regulations are identical to those
that expired except for changes in the addresses of the Southwest and Southeast Regions, NMFS. This reinstatement
is required by section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994. This rule also amends
a note in 50 CFR part 216 to conform to a cross reference from part 50 CFR part 229.

This rule is not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. Under section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;238,
the interim extension was extended until September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under
new section 118, whichever is earlier. This rule merely reinstates the regulations which, through administrative
delay, were allowed to lapse. The lapsed regulations were subject to full notice and opportunity-for-public-comment
procedures and no useful purpose would be served by delaying their reinstatement to provide notice and opportunity
for public comment. Full notice and opportunity for public comments will be provided for the section 118 regulations
presently being developed. Further, to delay reinstatement of the interim exemption regulations would be inconsistent
with section 114 whose clear intent was to have the exemption and its implementing regulations continue to avoid any
disruption to our commercial fisheries. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, under section
553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), finds, for good cause, that providing notice
and opportunity for public comment is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest. Because reinstatement
of the regulations relieves a restriction of commercial fisheries, under section 553(d)(1) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
this rule is not subject to a 30-day delay in effective date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The regulations in this part implement section 114 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 U.S.C.
1384, Public Law 100&hyph;711, which provides for a 5-year exemption from the Act's prohibition on the taking of marine
mammals incidental to certain commercial fishing operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The provisions of section 114 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, rather than sections 101, 103 and 104,
will govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations by persons using
vessels of the United States, other than vessels used in the eastern tropical Pacific tuna purse seine fishery, and
vessels which have valid fishing permits issued in accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)) for the period from November 23, 1988, through September 1, 1995, or until superseded
by regulations prescribed under section 118, whichever is earlier. Therefore, the regulations in this part supersede
until September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under section 118, whichever is earlier,
the other provisions for granting incidental take authority to these commercial fishermen, including regulations
at &sect;216.24 of this chapter and guidelines on the taking of small numbers of marine mammals incidental to commercial
fishing operations. (See &sect;216.24 of this chapter).

Categories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The List of Fisheries will be revised and commercial fisheries will be categorized into Category I, Category II or
Category III according to the following criteria. In evaluating incidental takes for purposes of categorizing fisheries,
the Assistant Administrator will consider the definition of take in section 3 of the Act, the language of section 114
of the Act and the legislative history of the 1988 amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category I.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i)(A) There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Congress intended that the fishery should be placed in Category I and there is no documented information indicating
that it should be placed in another Category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Frequent'' means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly
selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category II.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i)(A) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the
fishery; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors
such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished,
and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional''
incidental taking in the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly
selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period, but that there is little likelihood that more than one marine
mammal will be incidentally taken.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After receipt of a completed initial registration and required fee, an Exemption Certificate and decal will be issued
to the vessel owner. If the Certificate and decal are issued in 1989, a 1990 annual sticker for the decal will be automatically
issued upon receipt of required report(s) for 1989. The Exemption Certificate will be renewed and an annual sticker
issued after receipt of an updated registration, required fee and required report(s) covering all registered Category
I and II fisheries. An interim report should be submitted with the renewal request if fishing under the current Exemption
Certificate will not be completed by December 31.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) All Exemption Certificate holders must ensure that a daily log of fishing effort and incidental takes of marine
mammals is accurately maintained on board the fishing vessel in such form as prescribed by the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries. Fishermen must complete an entry on the report/log form each day they fish. Marine mammal report/log
forms require information on: The fishery, fishing effort, gear type and fish species involved; the marine mammal
species (or description of the animal(s), if species is not known), number, date, and location of marine mammal incidental
takes; type of interaction and any injury to the marine mammal; a description of any intentional takes (i.e., efforts
to deter animals to protect gear, catch, or human life by non-lethal or lethal means); and any loss of fish or gear caused
by marine mammals. With prior approval by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries
Service, alternate report/log forms, such as forms issued by individual states, Fishery Management Councils, or
Indian Governments, which collect the same information required by the National Marine Fisheries Service, are acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A current report/log must be kept on board and must be made available for inspection upon request by any state or
Federal enforcement agent authorized to enforce the Act or any designated agent of the National Marine Fisheries
Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An annual report, consisting of a copy of the required log, must be submitted to the National Marine Fisheries
Service no later than December 31 of each year covering all Categories I and II fisheries for which the Exemption Certificate
holder is registered. This log shall include information for all Categories I and II fisheries for which each Exemption
Certificate holder is registered, whether or not any marine mammals were taken. If a fishing vessel was not used in
a Category I or Category II fishery during an exemption period for which it was registered, a report to that effect must
be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Observer requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If requested by the National Marine Fisheries Service, a Certificate holder engaged in a Category I fishery must
take on board an observer to accompany the vessel on any or all fishing trips in a fishing season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After being notified by the National Marine Fisheries Service that the vessel is required to carry an observer,
the Certificate holder must comply with the notification by providing the specified information within the specified
time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips to facilitate observer placement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The National Marine Fisheries Service may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the facilities
for housing the observer or for carrying out observer functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety
of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.

aboard the vessel for biological processing, if feasible and if requested by the observer. Marine mammals designated
as biological specimens by the observer must be retained in cold storage aboard the vessel, if feasible, until retrieved
by authorized personnel of the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Observers may not bring a civil action against the vessel or vessel owner under any law of the United States for
any illness, disability, injury or death from service as an observer, except in cases of the vessel owner's willful
misconduct or if the observer is engaged by the owner, master or individual in charge of a vessel to perform any duties
in service to the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The National Marine Fisheries Service will provide for the payment of all reasonable costs directly related
to housing and maintaining observers on board vessels and related to maintaining biological specimens as requested
by the observer or required in Exemption Certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any marine mammal incidentally taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further injury and
may be retained only if authorized by an observer, by a condition of the Exemption Certificate, or by a scientific research
permit that is in the possession of the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A Certificate holder or a crew member may intentionally take marine mammals to protect catch, gear or person during
the course of the commercial fishing operation by a means and in a manner not expected to cause death or injury to a marine
mammal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the infliction of the damage to catch, gear or person is substantial and immediate and only after all non-injurious
means authorized by paragraph (c)(5) of this section have been taken, a Certificate holder or crew member may intentionally
injure or kill a marine mammal to protect gear, catch or person; except that it is prohibited for a Certificate holder
or crew member to intentionally lethally take any Steller sea lion, any Alaskan sea otter, any cetacean, any depleted
species (including the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seal), or any endangered or threatened marine
mammal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) No fishing gear, in whole or in part, may be willfully discarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Of any changes in mailing address or vessel ownership within 30 days of such change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Certificates and decals are not transferable. In the event of the sale or change in ownership of the vessel, the
Certificate is void and the new owner must register for an Exemption Certificate and decal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The Assistant Administrator may establish other terms and conditions on Exemption Certificates, including
terms and conditions for specific fisheries necessary to minimize adverse impacts to a marine mammal population
in accordance with the procedures in &sect;229.8(b) of this chapter or to comply with the Endangered Species Act of
1973.

Emergency regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is having an immediate
and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population, or in the case of Steller sea lions and North Pacific
fur seals, that more than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will be incidentally killed during a calendar year in all fisheries
combined, the Assistant Administrator will issue emergency regulations to prevent, to the maximum extent practicable,
any further taking. Any such regulations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Will be issued only after consultation with Regional Fishery Management Councils, state fishery agencies and
treaty Indian tribal governments, where appropriate, and will, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering
with existing Regional, state or tribal fishery management plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Will take into account the economics of the fishery and the availability of existing technology to minimize incidental
taking to the extent that elimination of the adverse effects on the marine mammal population will allow; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) May take effect immediately upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will remain in effect for no more than 180 days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is earlier; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Will be terminated by notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at an earlier date if the Assistant Administrator determines that the reasons for the emergency regulations no longer

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special regulations or conditions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is not having an
immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population, but that it will likely have a significant
adverse impact over a period of time longer than one year, the Assistant Administrator will request Regional Fishery
Management Councils, state fisheries agencies or treaty Indian tribal governments, where appropriate, to initiate
or take action to minimize such impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Councils, states or tribes do not take appropriate action in a reasonable period of time, the Assistant Administrator
will issue special regulations or impose special conditions on Exemption Certificates to mitigate the adverse impacts.

When a quota for the commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species in any portion of the fishery
management area is projected by the Regional Director to be reached on or by a certain date, the Secretary will, by notice
issued under &sect;661.23, close the commercial or recreational fishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portion
of the fishery management area to which the quota applies as of the date the quota is projected to be reached.

In the annual management measures for ocean salmon fisheries (59 FR 22999, May 4, 1994), NMFS announced that the 1994
recreational fishery in the area between Humbug Mountain, OR, and Horse Mountain, CA, would be open May 1 through June
30, 1994, or attainment of the 10,300 chinook salmon quota, whichever occurs first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The best available information on June 6, 1994, indicated that recreational catches in the area totaled 10,570 chinook
salmon through June 5, 1994. To provide public notice of at least 24 hours, the determination was made to close the fishery
at 12 midnight, June&blank;7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Oregon Department
of Fish and Wildlife, and the California Department of Fish and Game regarding this closure. The States of Oregon and
California will manage the recreational fishery in state waters adjacent to this area of the exclusive economic zone
in accordance with this Federal action. In accordance with the inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.23, actual
notice to fishermen of this action was given prior to 2400 hours local time, June 7, 1994, by telephone hotline number
(206) 526&hyph;6667 or (800) 662&hyph;9825 and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on channel 16 VHF-FM
and 2182 kHz. Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce has determined that good cause exists
for this document to be issued without affording a prior opportunity for public comment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 213 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a determination
of the significance of the contribution of nonroad sources to nonattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) in more than one nonattainment area. If the Agency makes a positive determination
of significance, it must then promulgate regulations that will result in reductions in emissions from nonroad sources.
In today's action, EPA is finalizing the determination of significance of emissions from nonroad engines. EPA is
also promulgating standards for carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen
(NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

) and smoke emissions from large nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts (kW) in power,
with exclusions for certain types of engines. The NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority for the actions in this notice is granted to EPA by sections 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213, 215,
216, and 301 of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7521, 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543, 7547, 7549, 7550,
7601(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) were enacted in order to broaden and strengthen the
CAA. While the CAA had long specifically authorized EPA regulation of on-highway vehicle and engine emissions, the
1990 amendments extended EPA's authority to regulate nonroad vehicles and engines. Specifically, revised section
213 directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine whether emissions
of CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone
or CO in more than one area which has failed to attain the NAAQS for ozone or CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes
of new nonroad engines and vehicles that contribute to such air pollution if nonroad emissions are determined to be
significant. EPA may also regulate other emissions from new nonroad engines or vehicles if the Agency determines
that they contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Finally,
EPA is to regulate emissions from new locomotives by 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study required by section 213(a)(1) was completed in November 1991.

 The purpose of this final rule is to implement section 213(a) (2), (3), (4), and (5) by determining that emissions from
nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone and CO nonattainment and by promulgating regulations
containing standards applicable to emissions from certain nonroad engines and vehicles.

III. Determination of Significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213(a)(2) of the CAA provides that after notice and public comment, EPA is to determine, based on the Nonroad
Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter called the Nonroad Study), whether nonroad emissions are significant
contributors to ozone or CO in more than one nonattainment area. Based on the results of the Nonroad Study and consideration
of the public comments discussed below, EPA is finalizing its proposed affirmative significance determination
in today's rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters did not address EPA's proposed determination of significance. Of those who did, most were
in opposition, including organizations representing equipment manufacturers and users. Expressing support for
the determination were some engine manufacturers, state and local organizations and environmental groups. A summary
of comments is found in the Response to Comments document contained in the docket for this rule. Major comments are
discussed below, accompanied by EPA's response.

1. Use of the EKMA Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that EPA had not adequately demonstrated a significant contribution to ozone or CO nonattainment
from nonroad engines or vehicles, as directed by the Act. These commenters argued that EPA had shown only the nonroad
contribution to ozone precursor and CO emission inventories, and not the nonroad contribution to ozone formation
or ozone and CO nonattainment. Some commenters questioned EPA's use of the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA
model) as the basis for its air quality analysis, and they suggested that EPA should have used a grid-based air quality
model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the Agency did conduct photochemical modeling. Using the EKMA model, the Agency analyzed the effects of
nonroad engine emission controls on ozone concentrations. The results of this analysis, presented in more detail
in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (ref. 58 FR 28809, May 17, 1993), showed that by eliminating nonroad engines
in the studied areas, ozone levels would drop between four and 13 parts per billion (ppb) below current levels. This
amounts to levels roughly three to eight percent lower than current levels in the 16 ozone nonattainment areas included
in the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EKMA model has been used by the Agency for a number of years. Although the decision to use this model was driven to
some extent by time and resource constraints, the Agency maintains its position that this model is valid and appropriate
for the nonroad analysis. The Agency may utilize grid-based air quality modeling in future analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Agency has traditionally based regulatory decisions on pollutant emission levels and the potential
for their reduction. Because of the wide variability inherent in photochemical modeling (source emission levels,
emission transport, and meteorological effects including ambient temperatures, cloud cover, sunlight intensity,
wind patterns, and so forth), the Agency has typically relied on estimates of potential reductions in source emission
inventories as the basis for regulatory analyses. These emission reduction estimates and the well established VOC/NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 link with tropospheric ozone formation, in conjunction with ozone monitors showing unacceptably high ambient ozone
levels, have formed the basis of the Agency's regulatory approach toward ozone control for many years. In addition,
as discussed in the NPRM, the Senate Committee Report, in discussing the significance of the contribution of nonroad
emissions to ozone problems, specifically discussed the percentage of nationwide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions attributed to nonroad engines. Thus, the Senate clearly understood the relationship between emissions
of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOCs to the creation of ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM discussed in detail the Nonroad Study's findings regarding the contribution from nonroad sources of summertime
VOCs and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These findings clearly show that emissions from nonroad engines are a major source of VOCs and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as well as CO in most, if not all of the nonattainment areas studied. Given the clear link between VOCs and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the formation of ozone, there can be no question that emissions from nonroad engines are significant contributors
to ozone formation in at least two ozone nonattainment areas. Therefore, the Agency has met the CAA mandate to ``determine
*&blank;*&blank;* whether emissions *&blank;*&blank;* from new and existing nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles
*&blank;*&blank;* are significant contributors to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in more than one area
which has failed to attain the national ambient air quality standards *&blank;*&blank;*''

Some commenters asserted that EPA failed to properly consider both the transport of ozone precursor emissions and
the natural decay of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 having a lifetime of only six to ten hours according to one commenter. One commenter suggested EPA had erroneously
assumed that ozone precursors emitted in rural areas are transported toward, and never away from, urban areas. Some
commenters suggested that equipment operated primarily in rural areas should be exempted from regulation since
these areas do not have air quality problems. Another commenter argued that reducing NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can increase ozone, therefore EPA must first show that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions will result in reduced ozone nonattainment before promulgating regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those commenters suggesting the Agency had erroneously assumed that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 always will be transported toward, rather than away from, the urban core, may have misunderstood the Agency's assumption.
The Agency assumed only that pollution transport 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
can 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
occur toward the urban core, thereby contributing to high source emission inventories. It is obvious that different
days will produce different transport patterns, and that the potential for rural NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and/or rural ozone to be transported toward the urban core exists.

major East Coast cities into attainment of the ozone standard. In addition, a National Academy of Sciences Study
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 states that, ``*&blank;*&blank;* ozone in rural areas of the eastern U.S. is limited by the availability of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

and New York City *&blank;*&blank;* will probably be necessary in addition to or instead of VOC control to alleviate
the ozone problem in many cities and regions.'' Even under those circumstances where a NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

further NO

The Agency disagrees with the contention that a specific numerical standard for significance must be determined
prior to considering whether nonroad emissions are significant. When Congress mandated that EPA determine the significance
of nonroad emissions, Congress could have given EPA a specific numerical mandate for determining whether such emissions
are significant contributors. Instead, Congress gave EPA wide discretion to determine whether the emissions of
NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, VOCs and CO from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone or CO concentrations. In any
case, any reasonable indicator of significance would conclude that emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles
were indeed significant contributors. As presented in the NPRM and discussed above, the Agency's photochemical
modeling showed that without nonroad sources, the ozone levels of 16 of the 19 analyzed nonattainment areas would
decrease from three to eight percent from their current levels and differences in excess of five percent were indicated
in eight of the 16 areas. Additionally, NO

 emission levels from nonroad sources were found to be exceeded by only one other source: the generation of electrical
power. Nonroad VOC emission levels were found to be exceeded by only two other sources: light-duty highway vehicles
and solvent evaporation. Nonroad CO emission levels were found to be exceeded by only two other sources: light-duty
highway vehicles and residential fuel use. In addition, emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles accounted for
over ten percent of the inventory of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) VOCs in 12 to 14 of the 19 nonattainment areas studied in the nonroad study;

As pointed out in the NPRM, in numerous nonattainment areas, other sources are regulated that have lower emissions
than the total from nonroad engines in the area. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the higher contributions
from nonroad sources in those areas are also significant enough to justify the regulation of NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that some equipment covered by the proposed regulations operates primarily (almost 80 percent
based on number of units) in areas already meeting federal clean air requirements; therefore, these commenters concluded
that such equipment should not be regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that these pieces of equipment can reasonably be expected to contribute to ozone nonattainment.
Also, the Agency has determined that it should not regulate engines only in urban nonattainment areas. Most commenters
made strong arguments substantiating the need for national uniformity of treatment for all equipment incorporating
regulated engines regardless of the intended geographic area of equipment use. Moreover, Title II of the Act generally
requires national regulation of mobile sources, given the inherent ability of such sources to move from one area to
another. Also, as discussed, nonroad sources have been clearly shown to contribute significantly to pollution in
several nonattainment areas.

5. Significance Determination for Classes and Categories of Nonroad Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that various subcategories of nonroad equipment (e.g., farm equipment, mining equipment)
individually represent only a small contribution to national pollutant inventories and to nonattainment and that
a significance determination should be made for each specific subcategory of nonroad engine, not for nonroad engines
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These comments have misinterpreted the clear language of section 213(a). Paragraphs one and two of section 213(a)
make it clear that EPA's determination of significance should be based on whether emissions from all new and existing
nonroad engines are significant contributors to ozone or CO concentrations. There is no indication that the significance
determination should be based on contributions from various subcategories of nonroad engines or vehicles. By contrast,
if the Administrator makes an affirmative decision regarding significance, then section 213(a)(3) requires the
Administrator to promulgate regulations for those classes and categories of nonroad engines and vehicles ``which
in the Administrator's judgment cause, or contribute to, such air pollution.'' This mandate does not include any
reference to a determination of significance for classes and categories. Thus, the Agency believes that Congress
did not intend a showing of significant contribution to be required for regulation of classes or categories of nonroad
engines and vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation is echoed by the language in section 213(a)(4) which allows the Agency to regulate new nonroad
engine emissions that were not referred to in the Nonroad Study. Under this paragraph, if the Agency determines that
any such emissions significantly contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the
public health or welfare, the Agency may promulgate regulations applicable to those classes or categories of new
nonroad engines and vehicles which in the Administrator's judgment cause or contribute to such air pollution. Once
again, there is a reference to significant contribution regarding the initial determination on emissions from all
nonroad engines or vehicles, but there is no such reference to significance in the subsequent language regarding
regulation of classes or categories of engines and vehicles. Therefore, it seems clear that Congress intended that
a showing of significance is not required for regulation of classes or categories of nonroad engines and vehicles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that EPA had misinterpreted the statute's requirements based on a perceived inconsistency
between that interpretation and the Agency's proposed consent decree settling several lawsuits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This commenter stated that, in the proposed consent decree, EPA had implicitly acknowledged its obligation to make
the significance determination for each category or class of products it intends to regulate by specifically reserving
its ``right'' to determine that large gasoline and/or small diesel nonroad engines do not cause or contribute to air
pollution within the meaning of section 213(a)(3). Such a reservation, this commenter argued, would be meaningless
if EPA were permitted, as proposed in the NPRM, to regulate any category or class of nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle
regardless of its contribution to ozone or CO concentrations in nonattainment areas.

The Agency disagrees with the assertion that there is an inconsistency between the Agency's proposed consent decree
and the NPRM. In fact, the consent decree does not discuss any determination of ``significant contribution'' for
classes or categories of nonroad engines. The decree only discusses ``contribution''. The Agency assumes this comment
is meant to suggest that prior to regulating, EPA must first show that each equipment type (agricultural, construction,
mining, and so forth) contributes significantly to nonattainment. As discussed above, the Agency interprets the
Act to provide for regulation of any classes or categories of nonroad engines and vehicles that can be shown to cause
or contribute to air pollution. The NPRM discussed the contribution to air pollution of the engine size and type being
regulated today. The Agency reserves the right to use other class or category types in future nonroad emissions regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that EPA's use of CMSAs to define the urban areas was inappropriate. These commenters asserted
that since many CMSAs encompass an area roughly equivalent to a 100 mile diameter, much of the CMSA is rural. Consequently,
EPA has assumed a uniform distribution of nonroad equipment resulting in as many farm tractors in downtown New York
City as in the surrounding countryside, according to comments.

Comments that EPA assumed a uniform distribution of equipment within areas evaluated in the Nonroad Study, thereby
resulting in an equal number of farm tractors in both downtown New York City and the surrounding countryside, are incorrect.
The equipment population distributions used in the Nonroad Study were derived from estimates of activity levels
within specific counties of each CMSA. A county, such as that containing Manhattan, would presumably show an activity
index for agricultural equipment presumably at or near zero. Therefore, the agricultural equipment population
estimate for Manhattan would also be at or near zero.

7. Support of the Agency's Determination of Significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters supported the Agency's proposed significance determination. One engine manufacturer supported
grouping the 80-plus types of nonroad equipment together instead of evaluating and regulating each type of equipment
separately. This commenter also stated that it is not cost effective to build parallel regulated/unregulated engine
families for the U.S. market to support regulated and unregulated applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State commented that it is particularly important that any EPA regulation control emissions from construction
and farm equipment, as those emissions cannot be controlled by state or local agencies. It cited its own estimates
that agricultural equipment contributes over 90 tons per day of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the State of California. Much of these emissions occur in the San Joaquin valley and are a primary contributor to
the nonattainment status of that overwhelmingly agricultural area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a major city agreed with the Agency's significance determination, stating that further reductions
in VOC, CO, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were essential to achieving attainment. A regional association of states also supported the Agency's determination
of significance, stating that engines subject to the proposed standards are responsible for approximately 11 percent
of all NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emitted in its region, making control of emissions from these sources critical to their efforts to meet the statutory
requirements of the CAA. An environmental association stated that without significant reductions from nonroad
engines, states will not be able to develop long-term plans for the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality
standards.

IV. Definition of Nonroad Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 216(10) defines the term ``nonroad engine'' as ``an internal combustion engine (including the fuel system)
that is not used in a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or that is not subject to standards promulgated
under section 111 or 202.'' Section 111(a)(3) of the CAA notes, however, that ``Nothing in Title II of this Act relating
to nonroad engines shall be construed to apply to stationary internal combustion engines.''

1. Original Proposed Definition of Nonroad Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA proposed that the engines encompassed by the statutory definition of nonroad engine included
internal combustion engines meeting one of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any internal combustion engine (including the fuel system) of any size which is used to propel any vehicle if the
engine is not otherwise excluded from this definition (see below). This includes any internal combustion engine
which serves a dual function (that is, to both propel a vehicle and operate a device while stationary), such as a mobile
crane; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any internal combustion engine which is located in (or on) a nonroad vehicle and which is an integral part of the
nonroad vehicle at the time of the nonroad vehicle's manufacture and which is not otherwise excluded from this definition
(see below); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any internal combustion engine or combination of internal combustion engines arranged to function together,
regardless of application, with a combined output of less than 175 hp, unless otherwise excluded from this definition
(see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several specific exclusions were included in the proposed definition of nonroad engines. An internal combustion
engine would not be considered a nonroad engine if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The engine is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the Act, regardless of size; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The engine is located on a trailer or other platform attached to (not an integral part of) a nonroad vehicle or is
otherwise not an integral part of a nonroad vehicle and the engine has an output greater than or equal to 175 hp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received numerous comments in response to this NPRM definition. The vast majority of commenters opposed all or
part of the proposed definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary reason cited by commenters for their opposition to the proposed definition relates to the use of a horsepower
(hp) cut-off point as the means for determining which internal combustion engines are classified as nonroad engines.
The commenters asserted that the use of a horsepower cut-off point would allow engines used in mobile applications
to be regulated as stationary sources, and would allow stationary engines to be regulated as mobile sources, solely
on the basis of engine size. The commenters noted that this would result in identical sources being regulated in a different
manner based solely on engine power. Commenters further indicated that the use of a horsepower cut-off point is arbitrary
and not reflective of the realities of portable or transportable equipment, which can be and are moved from one area
to another and, therefore, should be classified as nonroad regardless of horsepower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to these commenters, an engine should be classified on the basis of its use as mobile or stationary, rather
than on its horsepower. In other words, the determination as to whether an engine is a nonroad engine should depend
on whether the engine is either used in equipment that is mobile (that is, self-propelled, portable or transportable),
or in equipment that is in fact used in a stationary manner at a particular location for an extended period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters indicated that to do otherwise could result in costly and unnecessary administrative burdens
for manufacturers. According to these commenters, such administrative burdens would result from engines and equipment
that would be wrongly subjected to a myriad of different mobile and stationary source regulations in states and local
air quality management districts. The commenters also indicated that regulation by a multitude of regulatory agencies
could result in restricting the geographic operating range of certain engines and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters indicated that it would be contrary to the intent of the Act. In support of this position, these
commenters noted that Congress did not establish a horsepower cut-off point in the Act for distinguishing between
nonroad and stationary engines, and did not require that nonroad vehicles be self-propelled to fall within the nonroad
definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments from state and local air pollution control agencies also opposed the use of a horsepower cut-off point
for determining whether internal combustion engines would be classified as nonroad engines. Local air pollution
control agencies noted that they are currently regulating stationary engines under 175 hp and would lose the authority
to continue regulating these engines under the proposed nonroad definition.

2. Revised Definition of Nonroad Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments received regarding the nonroad definition proposed in the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA revised
the nonroad engine definition. The revised definition was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51595). The comment period was reopened until October 25, 1993, so that interested parties
could provide comments on the following revised definition of nonroad engine: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except as discussed in (2) below, a nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing
another function (such as a mobile crane); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawn mowers
and string trimmers); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) That, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable
of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to,
wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, platform or mounting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The engine is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the Act; or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The engine otherwise included in (1)(iii) remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months,
or a shorter period of time where such period is representative of normal annual source operation at a stationary source
that resides at a fixed location for more than 12 months (e.g., seasonal operations such as canning facilities.) A
location is any site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an
engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included
in calculating the consecutive time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A portable generator engine which functions as a permanent back-up generator and which is replaced by a different
engine (or engines) that performs the same function would be an example of engines covered by (2)(iii). In such a case,
the cumulative residence time of both generators, including the time between removal of the original engine and installation
of the replacement, would be counted toward the consecutive residence time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intended the revised definition of nonroad engines to address concerns expressed by the commenters in response
to the definition originally proposed. Under the revised definition, an internal combustion engine would be a nonroad
engine if it is used in equipment that is self-propelled or intended to be propelled while performing its function,
or if it is portable or transportable. The revised definition specifically distinguishes between nonroad engines
and stationary internal combustion engines on the basis of engine mobility and residence time, rather than on horsepower
size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intended that stationary internal combustion engines be all internal combustion engines regulated by a federal
New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act and all internal combustion engines that
are neither nonroad engines nor engines used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition. Moreover,
the revised definition specifically states that portable and transportable engines remaining in a particular location
for over 12 months are not nonroad engines (this excludes engines in self-propelled equipment and equipment intended
to be propelled while performing its intended function), thus ensuring that engines that are actually used in a stationary
manner are considered stationary engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised nonroad engine definition excluded from nonroad regulation those engines that are used for normal annual
source operations at fixed stationary sources that only operate on a seasonal basis, such as canneries. This provision
is designed to ensure that engines that operate as integral parts of these stationary sources are considered stationary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised nonroad engine definition also included a provision that if an engine is replaced by another engine within
the 12 month period, the replacement engine should be considered in calculating the consecutive time period. This
provision is designed to ensure that where an internal combustion engine is necessary for the operation of a stationary
facility, the replacement of one particular engine with another would not prevent the engines from being included
as part of the stationary facility.

EPA included as a prohibited act any attempt to circumvent the residence time exclusion of a portable or transportable
engine in (2)(iii) by means of removing the engine from its location for a period and then returning it to that same location.
In such cases, the time between removal of the engine and its return to service (or replacement) would be counted towards
the time period specified in (2)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of comments received on the revised definition supported the usage-based definition, as opposed to
the initially proposed power-based definition. Still, most commenters requested that EPA make two modifications
to the revised nonroad engine definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first modification requested by the commenters relates to section (2)(ii) of the revised definition which stated
that an engine is not a nonroad engine if it is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the CAA. The commenters expressed
concern that this portion of the definition would allow states to promulgate state regulations under the authority
of section 111, creating a loophole in the state preemption framework, whereby states would be able to regulate preempted
engines. They contended that this would result in dual standards for an engine, as both stationary and nonroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second modification requested by the commenters relates to the application of the 12 month residence time limitation
to seasonal operations. While most commenters agreed with the proposal to use a 12 month residence time limit to distinguish
between mobile and stationary use of portable or transportable engines, several commenters opposed the proposal
to consider residence time based on ``seasonal'' use. These commenters asserted that excluding an undefined group
of engines for an indeterminate period of time, between one and 365 days, is neither reasonable nor enforceable. Moreover,
the same commenters requested that EPA clarify that the 12 month residence time applies only to those portable and
transportable engines which are integral parts of fixed stationary sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the 12 month time limit on the grounds that it could create a regulatory vacuum which would result
in some engines escaping all nonroad engine and stationary engine regulations. In support of the revised nonroad
engine definition, another commenter stated that the equipment used on a military installation should be designed
so emissions are reduced by the engine manufacturer and not by the end user. The commenter requested that EPA clarify
the term ``location'' in a manner that would permit a ``location'' to exist within a stationary source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments from a State agency supported the elimination of the horsepower criteria for nonroad engines, but expressed
concern that the new definition would cause it to lose permitting authority for engines it was currently regulating
as stationary engines. The commenter suggested that those states with permitting programs be allowed to maintain
permitting authority over those engines which they had previously determined to be stationary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One local air pollution agency disagreed with EPA's conclusion that portable engines are nonroad engines. In support
of its position, the agency cited title V of the CAA as evidence that Congress recognized that some stationary sources
were moveable. If EPA were to adopt a definition based on residence time, the agency requested that three months, rather
than a year, be the cutoff point beyond which an engine would no longer be considered nonroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the revised nonroad definition eliminates the potential for the arbitrary classification
of internal combustion engines as nonroad or stationary sources based on engine size. Rather, as noted by the commenters,
the revised definition is based on the use of the engine, which is a more appropriate and reliable indicator of its classification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered the modification requested by some commenters regarding that portion of the definition that provides
an internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if it is regulated under CAA section 111. The Agency has amended
the revised definition to provide that an internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if ``The engine is regulated
by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act.'' Thus, under provision (2)(ii),
national emission standards for an internal combustion engine must be promulgated before it is classified as a stationary
engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the comments, EPA believes that it is appropriate to exclude from the nonroad definition engines that
remain at sources that only operate on a seasonal basis. Although such sources, such as canning facilities, may operate
for less than 12 months in any one year, they operate regularly for a similar time period year after year. Operations
for a seasonal source generally occur at the same location, rather than traveling between different states or regions.
Engines that are located at a seasonal source during the full annual operations period of that source should be considered
a part of that source. They are clearly integral parts of these facilities. Moreover, as such sources produce emissions
that can be calculated on a regular basis, a local air quality agency or other authority should be able to reasonably
enforce stationary source regulations. As a result, the Agency has maintained the seasonal source exclusion. However,
as requested by several commenters, EPA has revised the language for the exclusion to make it clearer. EPA believes
that a seasonal source is a stationary source because it functions at only one location for its full annual operating
period, even if that period is less than 12 months. EPA has specified in the final regulations that a seasonal source
must remain at a single location on a permanent basis (that is, at least two years) and must operate approximately three
months or more each year. EPA also clarified that an engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at
the source for the full annual operating period of the source. This should eliminate any confusion as to whether certain
sources are considered to be seasonal sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also disagrees with commenters who believe that only engines ``fixed'' in place for more than 12 months should
be excluded from the nonroad definition. An internal combustion engine can be stationary without being ``affixed''
to the ground or other structures. To require otherwise could result in the improper classification of internal combustion
engines. For example, an engine that is not bolted or otherwise attached to a structure but remains at one location
for five years would be classified under the commenters' proposition as a nonroad engine, even though it operates
in a stationary manner, as evidenced by its remaining at the same location for an extended period of time. Therefore,
the Agency has decided that the fact that an engine is not ``affixed'' to the ground or other structure does not necessarily
identify the internal combustion engine as a nonroad engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also believes that 12 months is the appropriate time limit for determining whether an internal combustion
engine which is either portable or transportable is to be classified as a stationary engine. Generally, engines that
remain at one site for more than 12 months will stay at that site either permanently or for an extended period of time.
In such cases, local or state air quality agencies should be able to regulate the applicable engines as stationary
sources, since the emissions impact is occurring over a period of time which is likely to have a measurable impact on
an area's air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``location'' has been defined so as to permit a ``location'' to exist within a facility. Section (2)(iii)
of the revised definition defines ``location'' as ``any single site at a building, structure, facility or installation.''
This definition of ``location'' provides more precision in classifying an engine as nonroad if the engine is actually
intended to be used in a mobile manner within a stationary source. In other words, an engine would be considered nonroad
if it moves to different sites within a stationary source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree with the assertion made by one commenter that title V of the CAA evidences Congress' recognition
that some stationary sources are moveable. Title V of the CAA deals with the permitting of stationary sources and not
with the determination as to which internal combustion engines are nonroad engines and which are stationary engines.

4. Nonroad Engines Manufactured Prior to the Effective Date of This Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the initial NPRM, EPA noted that it interprets the exclusion in CAA section 302(z) to apply only to those internal
combustion engines that are manufactured after the effective date of these regulations. EPA stated that this interpretation
avoids a regulatory gap for engines manufactured between the promulgation of the CAA and the date that these regulations
are promulgated. EPA received several comments opposing this interpretation. These commenters claimed that the
language in section 302(z) applied to all nonroad engines at the time of the passage of the 1990 CAAA, even though that
term had not yet been defined with any reasonable clarity. In addition, commenters asserted that nonroad engines
are generally preempted from regulation by states under title II of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to believe that internal combustion engines manufactured prior to the effective date of these regulations
should not be considered preempted nonroad engines. First, EPA believes that until the regulations finalizing the
definition of nonroad engine (as well as the regulations determining the scope of the term ``new'' as applied to nonroad
engines) were complete, no state or other entity could be assured whether such engines would be defined as nonroad
engines or as stationary internal combustion engines and the extent to which state regulations of such engines was
preempted. Congress clearly intended EPA to determine which internal combustion engines should be defined as nonroad
engines and which should be stationary internal combustion engines.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 As has been discussed above, the final definition of nonroad engine promulgated today is substantially revised from
the definition originally proposed. Moreover, as the comments reveal, numerous other definitions of nonroad engine
have been suggested to the Agency, many of which are either significantly broader or significantly narrower than
EPA's final definition. EPA believes that if the exclusionary language of section 302(z) were applied before EPA's
definition of nonroad engine became final, states would have been frustrated from regulating any internal combustion
engines manufactured during that time, given the uncertain nature of such engines. For example, a state would not
know whether to include regulations of engines in its New Source Review program, or whether such engines should be
regulated in a separate in-use operation program. Further, until the initial regulations regarding nonroad engines
were finalized, states could not determine the extent to which their regulation of such engines would be preempted,
and thus were hampered from going forward with specific programs to regulate such engines. EPA believes that Congress
did not intend states to be prevented from regulating these engines before EPA defined what they were. In particular,
EPA believes that permits for internal combustion engines issued prior to July 18, 1994, are not precluded under section
209 and 302(z) if the permits apply to internal combustion engines manufactured before July 18, 1994, even if those
engines are of a type that has been defined by EPA to be nonroad engines.

Moreover, even to the extent such engines are defined to be nonroad engines in this final rule, such engines were not
preempted from state regulations under section 209 prior to the effective date of these regulations. The two sections
of the Act preempting state regulation of nonroad engines, section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a) (as incorporated
by section 213(d)), refer to ``nonroad engines subject to regulation under this Act'' or to engines ``subject to this
part.'' EPA believes that, until EPA promulgated final regulations defining nonroad engines and subjecting such
engines to regulation, these engines were not preempted from state regulation under the Act, nor were they subject
to any regulation under title II of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, some of the comments regarding the definition of nonroad engines and the issue of grandfathering examined
whether grandfathering subjects an engine to dual regulation (i.e., regulation both by the state as a stationary
source and by EPA as a nonroad engine). There is no such risk in this instance because EPA has not subjected any engines
manufactured before the effective date of this regulation to regulation as new nonroad engines. Such engines, if
they are regulated at all, are regulated under title I programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, it should be noted that the vast majority of these engines are no longer new nonroad engines. Thus, even if
they are viewed as preempted nonroad engines, they are subject to in-use regulation by states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below in section VI. U. (definition of new), states are not precluded from regulating the use of nonroad
engines. Nothing in section 209 of the CAA prohibits local pollution control districts from regulating the operation
of nonroad engines, such as the hours of usage, sulfur limits in fuel (state fuel restrictions may in some cases be precluded
under section 211), daily mass emission limits, and title I operating permits. In addition, local districts can impose
a permitting fee consistent with the costs incurred for various operational expenditures, such as monitoring usage
and administrative functions. EPA believes that utilization of this option will assist local districts in achieving
their targeted emission levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, states are not prevented from requiring retrofitting of nonroad engines, as long as such requirements
do not amount to a standard relating back to the original design of the engine by the original engine manufacturer.
As discussed below, EPA believes modest retrofit requirements may be required after a reasonable amount of time,
such as at the time of reregistration or rebuilding. Moreover, after a sufficient time has passed after an engine ceases
to be new, for example, after the end of the useful life of the engine, a state may institute more significant retrofit
requirements. As the court stated in

but to prevent the burden on interstate commerce which would result if, instead of uniform standards, every state
and locality were left free to impose different standards for exhaust emission control devices for the manufacture
and sale of new cars.'' The Act does not intend preemption of regulations, like regulation of the use of nonroad engines
or modest retrofit requirements after an engine is no longer new, that ``would cause only minimal interference with
interstate commerce, since they would be directed at intrastate activities and the burden of compliance would be
on individual owners and not on manufacturers and distributors.''

EPA has added an interpretive rule in the form of an appendix to these regulations summarizing its views on these issues
(see Appendix I to subpart A of part 89: Internal combustion engines manufactured prior to the effective date of the
nonroad engine definition). This interpretive rule does not supersede, alter, replace, or change the scope of these
regulations. The appendix is intended to be interpretive guidance and is not final agency action subject to judicial
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments received from several of California's local air quality districts, the Agency is concerned about
the impact of the nonroad definition on the unique situation that exists in these areas, that is, the current local
regulation of certain engines as stationary sources which, as a result of the nonroad definition, will become nonroad
engines subject to emission standards promulgated only by EPA. According to the commenters, classification of these
engines as nonroad by EPA may negatively affect the ability of local districts to achieve targeted emission reduction
levels. To some extent, the grandfathering in of certain engines, discussed above, addresses this concern by ensuring
that engines regulated prior to the effective date of this rulemaking continue to be regulated in the same manner.
Nevertheless, this may not, in all situations, allay concerns regarding the overall impact that classification
of these engines as nonroad will have on an area. The Agency believes, however, that any additional concerns that may
exist following the effective date of this rule can be addressed by local air quality districts through their regulation
of nonroad engine operations.

5. Equating Nonroad Engines With Nonroad Vehicles and Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received one comment on the October 4, 1993 notice that opposed the revised definition of the term ``nonroad engine''
because, according to the commenter, the definition equated nonroad engines with nonroad equipment. This comment
states that, by defining nonroad engines in terms of their use ``in or on a piece of equipment,'' EPA exceeded its authority
because, according to the commenter, the CAA only authorizes EPA to regulate nonroad engines and vehicles, not nonroad
equipment. This comment argues that EPA does not have equal authority over off-highway mobile cranes, which are nonroad
vehicles, and lawnmowers and string trimmers, which are nonvehicular nonroad equipment. This comment asks EPA to
acknowledge that it lacks authority to regulate nonroad equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, EPA disagrees with the commenter's contention that the nonroad engine definition ``equates'' nonroad engines
with nonroad equipment. The nonroad engine definition is written to include only engines, and cannot be read to include
equipment. The definition clearly refers only to ``engines used in'' certain applications, not to the applications
themselves. Moreover, this definition has been promulgated pursuant to numerous comments received by the Agency,
discussed above, that assert that the most appropriate definition of nonroad engine is one that refers to the use or
application of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also notes that this rulemaking does not promulgate any standards for nonroad equipment, only for nonroad engines.
The only restriction on nonroad equipment manufacturers in this rulemaking is a prohibition on the use of uncertified
nonroad engines manufactured after the applicable implementation dates. This prohibition is necessary to enforce
the engine-based standards and is authorized under the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA does not agree that it lacks authority to regulate nonroad equipment or particular applications
of nonroad engines. CAA section 213, as well as section 301(a), provide EPA with authority to regulate both nonroad
equipment and particular applications of nonroad engines, as well as nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress used the terms ``nonroad engine,'' ``equipment,'' and ``vehicle'' interchangeably (see, e.g., S. Rep.,
Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee on Environment and Public Works to accompany
S. 1630, December 20, 1989, at 104&hyph;105). It is EPA's belief that Congress intended nonroad vehicles and engines
to be inclusive terms covering all manner and types of equipment not defined as motor vehicles, vehicles for competition,
or stationary sources (see, e.g., H. Rep., Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee
on Energy and Commerce to accompany H.R. 3030, May 17, 1990, at 310). There is no evidence that Congress intended to
limit the reach of its nonroad mandate to self-propelled vehicles; on the contrary, it appears that Congress used
the term vehicle to include any carrier for the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213 and the rest of the CAA provide EPA with authority to regulate nonroad equipment and particular applications
of nonroad engines in nonroad equipment. The Act provides equal authority to regulate off-highway mobile cranes,
which are nonroad vehicles, and lawnmowers, which are nonroad equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the interpretation of EPA's authority suggested by the commenter would undermine the environmental and
public health benefits of the nonroad emission reduction program by creating a gaping loophole. EPA can find no evidence
that Congress intended the regulation of certain nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment that cause or contribute
to air pollution, but not the regulation of others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there is a practical interrelationship between an engine and the equipment that houses it or is powered by
it. Equipment or vehicle characteristics may have a significant impact on the emissions associated with the operation
of the engine. The nonroad engine definition relies to a great extent on this interrelationship between an engine
and a piece of equipment to determine whether an engine is a mobile or stationary source. In the future development
of the nonroad program, EPA may determine that it is most effective to test and certify a nonroad engine integrally
with its related equipment, rather than separately. Additionally, it may become necessary and appropriate to regulate
aspects of equipment to control fuel spillage, evaporative emissions, or refueling emissions. EPA believes that
the CAA provides authority for such regulation. EPA does not believe Congress, in giving EPA the authority to regulate
all nonroad engines, intended to create an artificial barrier between the engine and the equipment that houses it.
Therefore, if EPA determines in future rulemakings that the most effective way to control emissions from nonroad
engines is to regulate directly the nonroad equipment housing the engines, EPA shall do so using its authority under
the Clean Air Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations of today's action apply to all new nonroad CI engines at or above 37 kW with certain exemptions and exclusions.
Hereafter the engines included in this rule will be referred to as ``large nonroad CI engines.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The vast majority of large nonroad CI engines currently being used and manufactured are diesel-fueled engines. The
use of alternative fuels by nonroad engines will not be necessary to meet the emission standards. However, these regulations
apply to large nonroad CI engines regardless of the fuel that is used (for example, diesel, compressed natural gas
(CNG), rapeseed, methanol, ethanol, and blends). Provisions have been included which allow manufacturers to apply
for Administrator approval of alternative test procedures if fuel other than diesel is to be used.

In addition, EPA is prepared to propose and adopt additional standards for HC, CO, and PM emissions for engines from
37 kW to less than 130 kW consistent with those to be adopted by the European Community (EEC) and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE) as soon as these groups finalize their requirements for HC, CO, and PM emissions. The European
standards are currently projected to be as follows:

Note that the adopted CO standard for engines at or above 130 kW may be changed from 11.5 g/kW-hr to 5.0 g/kW-hr when the
European rules are final. This would ensure consistency between EPA and the more stringent European standard. This
is also compatible with California since engines certified to the lower European CO standard would clearly be below

EPA is adopting the engine family definition as proposed. EPA had expressed some concern in its proposal that, should
it adopt HC, CO and PM emission standards in the final rule, it was uncertain whether manufacturers should be allowed
to include engines with different numbers of cylinders or cylinder orientations in the same engine family. EPA argued
that it was uncertain whether deterioration of HC, CO and PM emission performance would proceed at different rates
in-use for engines with different numbers of cylinders. One commenter expressed a strong desire to be able to consolidate
engine families as much as practicable. The commenter also reminded EPA of the substantial enforcement liability
program in this rule that would provide adequate incentive to ensure a manufacturer makes reasonable use of the engine
family flexibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is aware that additional built-in safeguards such as the manufacturers' burden to define engine families
in such a way as to ensure all engine configurations have similar emission characteristics, and the manufacturers'
recall liability if all engine configurations are not as durable as expected. The Agency has no additional data at
this time to address its original concern. However, the Agency does believe that the enforcement provisions in this
rule will provide incentive to manufacturers to ensure that their engines are properly grouped so that they can be
appropriately represented by the selected test engines.

For PM emission measurement, EPA is adopting the California test procedures finalized in Sections 2420&hyph;2427,
Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-duty Off-road
Diesel Cycle Engines,'' as amended by California Air Resources Board Resolution 92&hyph;2, described in CARB mailout

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of engines that are not able to operate properly over the 8-mode or smoke test cycles (such as engines
with constant speed governors) may petition the Administrator prior to certification to allow use of an alternative
test procedure. Upon adequate demonstration of need, the Administrator may allow use of alternative procedures.
If an engine is unable to be operated over the smoke test procedure, the manufacturer must submit an alternative test
plan to the Administrator for approval in advance of any testing performed for certification purposes. Use of alternative
test procedures to demonstrate exhaust emission compliance is discussed in Section VI.H.

3. Certification Test Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting the certification test fuel specifications as proposed. This is because the most common diesel fuel
available to nonroad engines will have a higher sulfur content than that required for highway CI engines. Furthermore,
to ensure that no commercially available fuel is inadvertently excluded by this rule, EPA has broadened the band of
fuel sulfur content to include all fuels ranging from greater than .05 percent to .5 percent fuel sulfur. However,
as a provision of harmonizing with California emission standards, and explained below, EPA will allow engine manufacturers
the option to use test fuel specified by California, which contains lower sulfur content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California's particulate standard is predicated on the use of low sulfur fuel, which is the State-wide fuel standard
for both nonroad and highway engines. Therefore, the particulate standard EPA is adopting is likewise predicated
on the use of low sulfur fuel. However, EPA cannot require testing on a fuel that is not widely available. To compensate
for the effect of sulfur on particulate emissions, EPA is permitting two options for demonstrating compliance with
those standards. First, EPA will allow testing on the low sulfur California-specified test fuel for compliance with
all emission standards because sulfur content does not impact HC, CO or NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. Second, when testing is conducted with the higher sulfur federal certification fuel, the particulate
measurement may be adjusted by using the following equation to reflect the effects of higher sulfur content of the
fuel on particulate emissions:

Should European requirements be finalized using a different fuel sulfur level but maintaining the same PM emission

 and smoke standards. EPA may select either fuel, without constraints, for confirmatory or other compliance testing
for all of the standards, except particulate. For particulate testing, EPA's options are constrained somewhat by
the manufacturer's choice of test fuel. If a manufacturer chooses to test using low sulfur California test fuel, EPA
would not use higher sulfur, with the associated adjustment factor, for official enforcement of the particulate
standard. However, if a manufacturer chooses to test using the higher sulfur fuel, EPA will presume the manufacturer
accepts the validity of the adjustment factor, in which case EPA could choose to do a particulate enforcement test
using either the higher sulfur fuel with adjustment or the low sulfur fuel without adjustment. This issue is discussed
further in section VI. I. below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM for this rulemaking, EPA is authorized under section 217 of the CAA to establish fees to recover
compliance program costs associated with sections 206 and 207. EPA will propose to establish fees for today's nonroad
compliance program at some future time, after associated costs are determined.

1. Prohibited Acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting provisions that will prohibit introducing engines into commerce in the U.S. which are not covered
by a certificate of conformity issued by EPA. Additionally it will be a prohibited act to use a regulated but uncertified
nonroad engine in nonroad vehicles or equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
With the exception of some revisions described below, the SEA program is being adopted as proposed. The large nonroad
CI engine SEA program is an emission compliance program for new production nonroad engines and is authorized by CAA
section 213. With this action EPA may issue a SEA test order for any engine family for which EPA has issued a certificate
of conformity.

3. Emission Defect Warranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting emission design and defect warranty requirements as proposed. Nonroad engine manufacturers will
be required to warrant emission related components for a period of five years or 3,000 hours from the date of purchase
by the ultimate purchaser. This warranty will help ensure the manufacturing of a durable emission system and will
require the manufacturer to cover all repairs and replacements involving emission related components, at no cost
to the ultimate purchaser, during the warranty period.

EPA is adopting as proposed prohibitions against tampering with nonroad engines. Nonroad tampering provisions
will help ensure that in-use engines remain in certified configurations and continue to comply with emission standards.
All persons, will be prohibited from removing or rendering inoperative any device or element of design installed
on or in a nonroad engine. The manufacturing, sale and installation of a part or component intended for use with a nonroad
engine, where a principal effect of the part or component is to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative a device or element
of design of the nonroad engine will also be prohibited.

EPA is implementing the proposed restrictions on the importation of nonconforming nonroad engines. Today's action
will permit independent commercial importers (ICIs) who hold valid certificates of conformity issued by EPA to import
nonconforming nonroad engines. Under this program, the ICI must certify the engine to applicable U.S. regulations
via the certification process before an engine is imported. ICIs will be responsible for assuring that subsequent
to importation, the nonroad engines are properly modified and/or tested to comply with EPA's emission and other requirements
over their useful lives. The ICIs will also be responsible for recalls, maintenance instructions, emission warranties,
engine emission labeling, and maintaining adequate records in the same manner as an engine manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action also provides certain exceptions to the restrictions on importing nonconforming nonroad engines.
These exceptions are similar to the existing regulations on importing nonconforming motor vehicles and motor vehicle
engines and include exemptions for repairs and alterations, testing, precertification, display, national security,
hardship, nonroad engines greater than 20 original production years old, and certain nonroad engines proven to be
identical, in all material respects, to their corresponding U.S. versions. These exceptions also include the exclusion
of nonconforming engines used solely for competition.

6. In-Use Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting the proposed regulations subjecting nonroad engine manufacturers to the requirements of section
207 of the CAA. Under the adopted regulations EPA has the authority to recall engines which do not comply with emission
standards in-use. As proposed, the in-use testing liability period will be up to seven years or 6,000 hours, which
ever occurs first. The actual repair period for which a manufacturer must remedy nonconformities would not be limited
by actual years or hours, thus any resulting recall will apply to all engines of the recall family, regardless of the
years or hours of an individual engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In-use compliance with emission standards will be determined based on test results using the same test procedure
as that used in certification. EPA is modeling its large nonroad CI engine recall program after section 207 of the CAA
and therefore the Administrator may require manufacturers to recall applicable engines if a substantial number
of properly maintained and used engines are found to be out of conformity with the regulations issued under section
213 of the CAA.

7. Defect Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting the proposed emission defect reporting regulations which require manufacturers to report to EPA
emission-related defects that affect a given class or category of engines. The emission defect reporting regulations
also specify procedural and reporting requirements for manufacturers that initiate voluntary emission recalls.

8. Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting the proposed regulations which allow manufacturers and other persons, where appropriate, to request
exemptions from regulation for certain purposes. These purposes include testing, display, national security,
export, and for manufacturer-owned and precertification nonroad engines.

VI. Public Participation and Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA held a public hearing on June 25, 1993 at which testimony was given by 14 individuals, including representatives
from equipment and engine manufacturers and states. The public comment period was open until July 27, 1993. EPA received
over 80 written comments during this time. In addition, meetings were requested by two organizations and held during
the comment period. As mentioned previously, the public comment period was reopened from October 4, 1993 through
October 25, 1993. During this period, EPA received additional comments which were given further consideration in
developing the final rule. The discussion of major comments and EPA's responses are divided into general categories.
More detailed Agency responses to comments may be found in the ``Response to Comments'' document in the docket for
this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a related rule concerning preemption of state nonroad regulations was proposed at 56 FR 45866, September
6, 1991. A public hearing was conducted on September 20, 1991. Many industries presented comments through an association
or individually. Represented at the hearing and in written comments are the following: engine manufacturers; manufacturers
and dealers of various types of equipment including agricultural, construction, mining, utility, and lawn and garden;
manufacturers of emission controls; railroads; manufacturers of industrial trucks; the San Diego Country Air Pollution
Control District; and the State of California. EPA considered these comments in promulgating this final rule.

A. Conversion of Standards and Measures to Metric Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA's proposed regulation presented standards and measures in non-metric units, with metric units given parenthetically.
Comments were received requesting that, for purposes of harmonization with Europe, EPA present all standards and
measures in metric units, forgoing the non-metric units altogether. EPA has the authority to do so under the Metric
Conversion Act of 1975 and Executive Order of July 25, 1991. Therefore, EPA is adopting metric units in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the final rule, the metric power equivalents (kilowatts (kW)) given for horsepower units in two cases are different
from the proposed equivalents. The 131 kW category in the NPRM is now 130 kW, and the 559 kW category is now 560 kW. EPA
was requested to adopt the 130 and 560 kW categories because they are in harmony with categories currently being developed
by the European Community. An engine manufacturers' association stated that so doing would not include or exclude
any engines that would not otherwise have been included or excluded in EPA's proposed rule. EPA agrees that a one kW
change will not significantly affect the engine family implementation schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The units in the tables of standards and implementation dates in this preamble show the non-metric equivalents. The
regulatory language is exclusively metric.

B. Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. HC, CO, and PM Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA proposed NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 and smoke standards and did not propose standards for HC, CO, and PM. Since NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission was demonstrated in the draft Regulatory Support Document to be largely unaffected by transient operation,
EPA is confident that an emission standard based on the adopted steady-state 8-mode test procedures for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will result in a sizable in-use emission reduction. Likewise for smoke, the adopted on-highway smoke test procedures
have both transient and steady-state operating modes, giving EPA confidence that the necessary technologies will
be applied to meet the smoke standards which will result in actual in-use emission reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in its proposed rule, the Agency reasoned that sufficient data and analyses had not been generated to adequately
demonstrate that the 8-mode test procedures are representative of potential transient operation occurring in actual
use. Since HC, CO, and PM emissions typically increase during transient operation, the Agency was not confident that
standards for these three pollutants on the adopted steady-state 8-mode test procedures would result in real emission
reduction in actual use and, thus, proposed not to regulate them. However, EPA did request comment on the appropriateness
of adopting standards for these pollutants. In particular, EPA requested comment on whether it should adopt California's
standards for these pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local agencies, environmental groups, health agency officials, and engine industry representatives
all requested that standards for HC, CO, and PM be included in the rule. The industry argued that, while adequate data
may not have been generated to establish an emission reduction benefit of the additional standards, adoption of the
additional standards is critical to worldwide marketing strategies which require regulatory harmony between the
U.S. and foreign government entities. The industry commenters claim, in this context, that by harmonizing with the
California standards and the projected European standards presented in Section V.B., EPA would actually reduce
the cost to an engine manufacturer which would not be compelled to build a different version of its engine for U.S. consumption
than would be built for the rest of the world. Arguments were presented that in any case there would be no harm in regulating
these additional pollutant emissions and there might be some consequential emission control or at least a capping
effect on HC, CO, and PM emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is committed to providing regulatory harmonization when it can be done without compromising U.S. environmental
goals. Since HC, CO, and PM emissions are typically higher during transient operation, EPA maintains its position
that there is too much uncertainty about the ability of the existing steady state test procedures to accurately predict
those emissions from in-use nonroad engines. Therefore, EPA believes it is technically incorrect to claim emission
reduction benefits for HC, CO, and PM emissions as measured by the test procedure being adopted. However, at the same
time, EPA believes that adopting these standards will not compromise U.S. nationally uniform environmental goals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching the decision to regulate HC, CO, and PM, EPA had to consider any additional costs which might be imposed,
and queried the industry during the public comment period. Engine manufacturers responded that these additional
standards would not result in added cost, or that any added costs would be offset by the efficiency gained by having
harmonized standards. On the basis of these comments, EPA is concluding that adopting HC, CO, and PM standards will
not result in increased cost burden.

 compliance, where there are quantifiable environmental benefits to be gained. However, because HC, CO and PM standards
have been promulgated solely for harmonization with California and Europe (neither of which allow ABT), and because
the benefits for HC, CO, and PM are not similarly quantifiable, ABT is not appropriate for HC, CO, and PM. Moreover,
the burden to the Agency and to industry of tracking and enforcing ABT for HC, CO, and PM would defeat the Agency's intent
to minimize such burdens to the degree that the Agency would reconsider its decision to adopt those standards at all,
an option the Agency is not willing to choose.

2. Smoke Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questioned EPA's authority to regulate smoke emissions, stating that EPA did not demonstrate as required
in CAA section 213(a)(4) that smoke significantly contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger public health or welfare. EPA made a finding in the NPRM that smoke significantly contributes to air pollution,
based on smoke's impact on visibility. As evidence of smoke's significant contribution to air pollution, EPA specifically
cited in its draft Regulatory Support Document the agreement to reduce smoke from the Navajo Generating Station to
improve visibility in the Grand Canyon. EPA discussed in the NPRM why smoke may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
both public health and welfare. EPA stated that ``there are indications that visible smoke may have an adverse effect
on health'' (58 FR 28809, 28845). The particles that make up smoke, about 2.5 microns in diameter, are of a size that
reflects and refracts light. These particles are sufficiently small to be inhaled into the lower lung cavities, thus
posing a potential health threat to the inhaler. See, for example, volume 329 of the New England Journal of Medicine
(December 9, 1993, p. 1753) for a discussion of the association between particulate air pollution and mortality rates.
EPA also cited damage through soiling of urban buildings, homes, cars and other property. EPA has met the statutory
mandate of CAA section 213(a)(4) for smoke, and stands by its assessments presented in the NPRM and RSD for this rulemaking.
Hence, EPA is retaining the smoke standards as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Lower Emission Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmentalists and states requested that EPA commit to a second phase of emission standards for new large nonroad
CI engines on an ``aggressive'' timeline. They are satisfied with the level of the standard only on an interim basis
and want to quickly move to a more stringent standard. One commenter expressed concern that, without specifying a
deadline for promulgating a second phase of emission standards in this rule, manufacturers will be slow to cooperate
with EPA in developing the new test procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine manufacturers have asked for assurances that they will have from five to eight years of ``regulatory stability''
before more stringent standards are promulgated, in order to amortize their investment in the current standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that more stringent emission standards should not be promulgated until the existing test cycle has been
verified to be representative, or until a more representative test cycle has been developed. EPA is currently working
with engine manufacturers to evaluate actual in-use operating conditions and the test procedures adopted in this
rule. These data will be used to determine the necessary modifications to the test procedures to ensure that more stringent
emission standards in the future result in actual in-use emission reductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has every intention of moving forward to determine the most appropriate test procedures to use in future regulation
of the engines covered in this rule. EPA has found that coordination with industry on clearly technical projects such
as this is most beneficial since it allows the Agency to receive early input as procedures are being developed. Such
early feedback creates an atmosphere of consensus-building and allows the Agency to promulgate rules that are more
equitable, efficient and effective. At this point, however, EPA cannot make assurances that it will provide engine
manufacturers ``five to eight years of regulatory stability,'' and neither can it commit to promulgating more stringent
standards on an ``aggressive'' timeline.

D. Exemptions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Mining Congress and other commenters in the mining industry requested that surface mining equipment
be exempted from regulation since, according to the commenters, mining equipment operates well outside nonattainment
areas. One commenter within the mining industry suggested that regulation of mining equipment should be on a case-by-case
basis. In other words, if the mining equipment at a site is shown to contribute to ozone or CO nonattainment, the equipment
at that site should be subject to regulation. As an alternative, these commenters suggested horsepower cutoffs ranging
from 500 to 750 horsepower, above which nonroad equipment would be exempted from compliance. These commenters also
took exception to EPA's inclusion of mining equipment in the construction equipment category, stating that mining
equipment is larger and more specialized than construction equipment. Further, they stated that while construction
equipment may be used at a mine site, mining equipment is never used on a typical urban construction site. These commenters
also questioned EPA's application of the proposed regulations to mining equipment since emissions from such equipment
were not included in the analysis contained in the Nonroad Study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency sees no justifiable reason for exempting from regulation all mining equipment or mining equipment above
certain horsepower cutoffs. The Agency is obliged to regulate all classes or categories of new nonroad engines that
cause or contribute (without reference to significance) to ozone or CO pollution in more than one nonattainment area.
The Agency believes that such equipment, even if operating outside nonattainment areas, is capable of contributing
to ozone nonattainment and, therefore, the Agency cannot justify an exemption of mining equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding whether mining equipment is being inappropriately included in the construction equipment category,
the Agency believes that mining equipment should not be treated as a separate class of equipment. There is acknowledged
crossover of equipment used on construction and mining sites. For example, excavators, off-highway trucks, crushing
equipment, rubber tired loaders and dozers, and crawler tractors are types of equipment commonly used by both mining
and construction industries. While some equipment may currently be used only at mining sites, there is no way to predict
future equipment use with certainty. Given the high degree of similarity between construction equipment and equipment
used in mines, EPA believes that it is justified in treating equipment used in mining as a subcategory of construction
equipment. EPA is not required, in determining classes and categories of nonroad engines or vehicles, to subdivide
such engines into small subcategories of engines, each of which may have less of an impact on nonattainment than the
broader category in which they are included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, it should be noted that the American Mining Congress specifically stated in its comments in the recent EPA
rulemaking on preemption of state standards for nonroad engines and vehicles that surface mining equipment should
be considered ``construction equipment'' in the context of that rulemaking (EPA Docket No. A&hyph;91&hyph;18).
In addition, EPA held a meeting with the American Mining Congress on July 22, 1993, and asked for specific information
to support their request for exemption from the proposed regulations. Such information requests included specific
dollar figures for the technology needed to comply, a component level breakdown of costs, annual equipment sales
and horsepower ranges of mining equipment and other information specifically targeted toward the impacts of mining
equipment on ozone and CO nonattainment.

Commenters suggested the Agency use varying horsepower cutoffs above which nonroad engines should not be regulated.
The main rationale given by commenters was that the technology improvements and/or design changes to these larger
engines would be too costly. EPA has received very little data directly addressing the actual costs anticipated for
these changes, and no information was provided detailing the specific unique high cost technologies that these engines
would need, even after the specific request by EPA discussed above. As discussed in section VII, EPA agrees that the
cost of compliance for engines over 560 kW (750 horsepower) would be more than the average cost per engine estimated
in this rule. EPA uses the net present value of the retail price increase per engine reported in this rule to estimate
the cost of this regulation to society, not to predict the cost of any particular engine covered by this rule. While
the Agency did not do a cost breakout by engine size, EPA's assessment of the limited cost data submitted by one manufacturer
of engines greater than 560 kW suggests that the retail price of these larger engines could increase by approximately
$100 per 75 kW due to this regulation. Therefore, in absolute terms, the cost is greater for larger engines. However,
in relative terms, the price increase for larger engines only represents about one percent of the total cost of the
equipment in which the engine is used. On average, this represents a slightly lower percentage price increase than
for smaller engines covered by this rule. EPA has determined that this level of increase for extremely high cost machinery
is reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received several comments stating that certain farm equipment, skid steer loaders in particular, should
be exempted from regulation because they do not significantly contribute to ozone nonattainment. As discussed above,
EPA is not required to make a significance determination for every category of nonroad engine it intends to regulate.
The significance determination applies only to the initial determination regarding emissions from all nonroad
engines and vehicles. Once that determination is made, the Agency shall promulgate regulations for all classes and
categories that contribute (without reference to significance) to nonattainment in more than one area. The Nonroad
Study clearly shows that farm equipment air pollution causes or contributes to nonattainment in several of the nonattainment
areas studied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to specific subcategories of farm equipment, EPA is not required to make determinations regarding every
subcategory of equipment that it intends to regulate. The Senate, in fact, instructed EPA not to disaggregate the
universe of nonroad engines into small subcategories.

E. Particulate Matter Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting by reference the PM test procedures adopted by California in Sections 2420&hyph;2427, Chapter 11,
title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road
Diesel Cycle Engines.'' California developed its test procedures by combining portions of the June 2 and June 30,
1992 versions of the test procedures being developed by the International Standards Organization as ISO&hyph;8178
test procedures recommended practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the PM test procedures to adopt in the final rule, EPA considered the need for harmonization and enforceability.
EPA determined that the California PM test procedures meet these two needs. First, this procedure ensures harmonization
with the State of California, allowing manufacturers to design one engine for both the California and federal markets.
The California procedures include the full range of the ISO&hyph;8178 recommended practices as published in June
1992, providing wide latitude for the conditions and methods used for PM measurement. EPA is not concerned with allowing
the engine manufacturers to use the full latitude of ISO&hyph;8178 for certification testing because, as previously
discussed, no PM emission reduction benefits are being claimed, and EPA has the ability to perform in-use compliance
testing over the entire range of the ISO&hyph;8178 procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is confident that its ability to perform compliance testing using any procedure within the boundaries of ISO&hyph;8178
will ensure that engine manufacturers use good judgment in selecting their specific PM test procedures. At the same
time, EPA recognizes the potential burden of liability for emission compliance over the entire range of conditions
specified in ISO&hyph;8178. This burden results from an engine manufacturer's responsibility to comply with emission
standards under any test conditions specified by the test procedures. Historically, when a range of test conditions
exist, manufacturers choose to test with the conditions which are worst-case for emissions performance. To the extent
that a manufacturer is unable to determine with certainty the worst-case conditions, it may be necessary to perform
a number of emission tests which bracket the range of test condition combinations within the ISO&hyph;8178 procedures
to ensure that the worst-case emissions are accounted for. Thus the burden to the manufacturer is increased testing
dictated by the level of risk that a particular engine family would fail EPA testing (compliance or in-use) due to an
unaccounted-for test condition specified in ISO&hyph;8178. However, EPA believes that the overriding concern
expressed in the comments for harmonization outweighs the potential burden of liability to comply with a broad test
procedure. Furthermore, the Agency does not have an alternative test procedure option that would ensure harmonization
at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is satisfied that the adopted PM test procedures are implementable and enforceable. The Agency is prepared to
review any proposals from the nonroad manufacturing industry to modify any portions of the PM test procedures that
would narrow the scope of test conditions while maintaining the integrity of the procedures. EPA is not prepared to
make its own proposal to tighten the test procedure specifications at this time as it might negatively impact harmonization
for an emittant for which EPA is claiming no emission benefit in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered adopting a modified version of its current on-highway engine test procedures for particulate contained
in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. This would address the flexibility issues regarding the ISO&hyph;8178 procedure, because
subpart N has tighter measurement tolerances and specific methodologies and procedures for emission measurement.
However, EPA did not have an effective means to address the various needs of the different manufacturers (that originally
led to the broad range of options in ISO&hyph;8178) in the time frame of this rule without adversely affecting some
manufacturers more than others. Additionally, this approach presented some risk that the test procedures developed
from EPA's current regulations would contain some elements not in harmony with California and Europe. Since EPA believes
the California PM test procedures will meet its needs and ensure harmony, development of its own procedures based
on subpart N was determined less desirable at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA considered, but rejected, adoption of the most recent United Nation draft version of ISO&hyph;8178.
This draft represents the most current development of these test procedures and is compatible with current European
plans. However, the United Nation's draft version of ISO&hyph;8178 must still go through a review process that could
result in a number of additional changes and will likely take one to two years before being adopted. If EPA adopted the
draft United Nations version, the Agency could eventually find itself to be in harmony with neither the California
version nor the final adopted European version of ISO&hyph;8178.

F. Smoke Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters requested that EPA revise the on-highway smoke procedures in 40 CFR 86, Subpart I, which were proposed
for this rule. The same revisions were requested under a separate EPA action that specifically focuses on technical
clarification on the subpart I procedures. Since part 89 regulations directly reference the part 86 subpart I procedures,
EPA will not consider these comments in this rule. Any revisions adopted under the separate EPA action of technical
amendments to part 86 subpart I procedures will likewise apply to engines certified under part 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers point out that this test was specifically designed for on-highway truck engines and is less applicable
to nonroad engine usage, but agree that this test is the best available at this time. In their comments, engine manufacturers
agreed to use the on-highway smoke test procedures until more representative and globally harmonized smoke test
procedures can be developed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is working closely with Europe and other government agencies as well as with voluntary standard-setting organizations
to develop new smoke test procedures. These procedures are not sufficiently developed at this time to reference or
adopt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is willing to use cooperatively developed and harmonized smoke test procedures that it determines meet its needs
to control in-use smoke emissions. A mechanism has been provided in this rule to allow the use of such procedures via
the alternative test procedures approval process. With this process, the manufacturer requests EPA approval to
use the alternative test procedures in advance of certification. EPA has authority to grant such a request if the procedures
are determined to be equivalent or better than the promulgated procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of a ``world-wide'' smoke procedure, EPA is confident the adopted procedures will reduce smoke emissions
and will ensure harmonization with California. California has pointed out it has modified its test procedures somewhat
by allowing the use of an in-line smokemeter. EPA has included provisions by which a manufacturer may use alternative
measuring equipment upon demonstration that it correlates with the current opacity meter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided not to allow use of the on-highway FTP for any aspect of nonroad engine certification. Based on data
received during the comment period and discussed in the Response to Comments document, the ability of the on-highway
test cycle to predict nonroad NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions for some types of engines is uncertain. In addition, even those commenters in support of the on-highway
FTP option stated that they would likely make minimal use of it. These reasons form the basis of EPA's decision not to
adopt this option.

H. Alternate Test Procedures for Constant Speed Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of engine manufacturers requested that EPA allow use of an alternate test procedure for engines that use constant
speed governors. These engines are typically used on applications such as generator sets that must be capable of holding
one precise speed during operation. Commenters have stated that these engines are not properly represented by, and
may not be capable of operating over, the 8-mode test procedures. Commenters recommended that EPA allow use of the
ISO 8178&hyph;D2 test procedures (2-mode) for constant speed engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has a mechanism in the regulations that would allow this request for alternate test procedures to be made with full
technical justification. Insufficient data were presented for EPA to determine the need and appropriateness of
adopting the specific ISO 8178&hyph;D2 test procedures for constant speed engines in this final rule. However, there
may be adequate technical justification for such an alternate test procedure. EPA has made available in the regulations
provisions by which an engine manufacturer may propose to the Administrator the use of an alternate test procedure
with adequate demonstration. This would be the appropriate mechanism for manufacturers of constant speed engines
should they determine that the 8-mode test procedures are unrepresentative for their engines.

I. Certification Test Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting test fuel requirements which allow an engine manufacturer to submit data either using a test fuel that
falls within the specification in the proposed regulations, modified to expand the fuel sulfur range to greater than
.05 percent to .5 percent fuel sulfur, or a lower sulfur test fuel that is consistent with the test fuel to be used in California.
EPA retains the right to perform confirmatory or in-use enforcement testing using either test fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA modified the fuel sulfur concentration range of its proposed test fuel based on concerns that the range specified
may inadvertently preclude the use of a fuel that could be available for use now or in the future. For example, the current
proposal in Europe specifies a test fuel with sulfur content ranging from .1 percent to .2 percent. Should the final
European requirements specify such a fuel in the future, EPA's proposal would not have allowed use of this fuel. As
this is not EPA's intent, the Agency chose to broaden the range of fuel sulfur content specified in Table 4 to Appendix
A of Subpart D in Part 89 of today's regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed that all nonroad engines be certified using test fuel with a sulfur content of 0.2 to 0.5 percent sulfur
by weight. EPA reasoned that although federal on-highway and California state-wide sulfur specifications will
be .03 to .05 percent sulfur by weight, some diesel fuel producers will continue to provide fuel with a higher sulfur
content for 49-state nonroad use. EPA believes some producers will decide not to incur the cost of purchasing and operating
hydrotreating equipment necessary for sulfur removal in the absence of a requirement to provide low sulfur fuel for
the federal nonroad segment of the market. Therefore, it is likely that the fuel available to the majority of nonroad
engines will be higher sulfur fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers requested to certify on low sulfur fuel because it will save them the cost of performing an extra test
(that is, one on high sulfur fuel for the federal rule and one on low sulfur fuel for California). They argued that because
the sulfur content of the fuel does not influence the production of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission and smoke, they should be allowed to use low sulfur fuel for certification testing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that using fuel specifications of commercially available fuel for certification testing is an important
demonstration of emission performance of in-use nonroad engines. EPA acknowledges that, in this case, the sulfur
content of the test fuel will not impact either NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or smoke emissions. However, EPA has agreed to adopt PM standards for the purposes of harmonization with California
and Europe. It is generally accepted that fuel sulfur has a noticeable impact on PM emissions. The impact of fuel sulfur
on PM, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoke emissions is discussed further in the Response to Comments document. Since fuel sulfur does have an impact
on PM emissions, PM emissions in the federal fleet will be higher in actual use than in the California fleet where the
only available fuel will have low sulfur content. While this rationale would argue against allowing use of low sulfur
certification fuel, at the same time, it is likely that the engines certified on low sulfur fuel will have no higher
PM emission in actual use than would have resulted had EPA promulgated only NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoke emission standards. Because harmonization, rather than emission benefits, is the driving factor behind
EPA's decision to impose the PM standard, EPA sees no need to increase the testing burden by requiring a different certification
fuel specification to demonstrate compliance with the PM standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, EPA will, at this time, allow engine manufacturers the option to use low sulfur test fuel as specified
in the regulatory language and consistent with California regulations. EPA may not continue to allow this option
in future regulations where emission benefits for PM reduction are claimed, unless EPA is satisfied that the low sulfur
test fuel is the fuel generally used by the regulated engines. Manufacturers using the higher sulfur test fuel may
normalize the PM emission results with the equation discussed in section V.D.3.

J. Certification Test Engine Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that the test engine selected to represent an engine family be a ``worst case emitter.'' This proposal
allowed each manufacturer to use its best technical judgment based on unique understanding of the specific engine
design it is certifying. The flexibility of such a methodology could result in the most cost effective and most accurate
selections, because the selection would be tailored to the specific engine family being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine manufacturers were not comfortable taking on the uncertainty of choosing their own ``worst case'' test engine,
pointing out that ``worst case'' is ambiguous. For example, what is worst case for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may not be worst case for smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware of this tendency for ``worst case'' to be emission specific. For that reason, in the past, the federal on-highway
rules and CARB's rule have specified that the engine selected for certification testing must be the one that injects
the most fuel per stroke of an injector at maximum power. This approach generally results in the selection of the least
efficient design within the engine family. While this approach is more prescriptive than the proposal, it generally
results in more consistency and is more likely to assure the selection of worst case for at least some of the emittants.
It gives manufacturers a more defined program and creates less administrative burden than the proposed method which
required manufacturers and EPA to make determinations and evaluations for each engine family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, EPA is adopting this more traditional engine selection criteria_most fuel per stroke
of an injector at maximum power_in the final rule.

K. Miscellaneous Certification Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Engine Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received requesting that EPA modify some of the proposed engine labeling requirements to be consistent
with California regulations. Some of the modifications requested were wording changes. Others involved deleting
or changing labeling requirements. EPA's response to these requests is included in the Response to Comments document.
One request for a modification had the potential for a more significant impact on industry. This request was to add
a provision requiring ``supplemental labels'' to be installed by the equipment manufacturer should the original
engine label be obscured after engine installation. EPA believes this provision would impose an additional burden
on the equipment manufacturers (in the form of label costs and recordkeeping to ensure the correct label was placed
on the equipment) and that no significant benefit would be gained. Thus, EPA is not requiring the use of supplemental
labels, but will not prohibit equipment manufacturers from using such labels, provided the labels meet the labeling
requirements set forth in the regulation.

2. Requiring Yearly Certification, Accepting California and European Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received requesting that EPA not require yearly certification in cases where no changes to the engine
family were made. EPA is retaining this requirement. It believes that the burden imposed on manufacturers in cases
where no changes are made is minimal (no additional testing required and only the resubmission of paperwork from the
previous year), and that yearly certification ensures continuity and equitable treatment among manufacturers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter also requested that EPA accept certification by California or Europe in lieu of federal certification
for reasons of economy. EPA's on-highway certification program requires that every vehicle sold in the United States
be covered by a federal certificate of conformity. On-highway manufacturers are permitted to ``carry across'' emission
data from testing performed to demonstrate compliance with California regulations to satisfy federal requirements.
This is possible because the test procedures are identical. For the nonroad certification program, EPA envisions
that similar certification and carryover/carry across policies will be in effect, which will allow manufacturers
to use the test data from a test performed for European or California certification to satisfy federal requirements
as long as the manufacturer provides evidence that the procedures used comply with the federal regulations. It is
EPA's responsibility to assure compliance with federal regulations. Manufacturers should be assured, however,
that the consistency and quality of the California certification program is such that engine families certified
by California will very likely receive federal certification. At this time, European regulations are not final,
so EPA cannot yet officially harmonize its requirements with Europe. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its proposal to
require an annual federal certificate for each engine family.

3. Technical Certification Test Procedure Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were provided on subparts D and E of the regulatory language, dealing with certification test equipment
and test procedures. In some cases, the comments were corrections of typographical errors or inconsistencies within
the regulatory language. In other cases, EPA was requested to modify technical aspects of its proposed procedure.
EPA adopted some, but not all of, the requested changes. These are discussed in the Response to Comments Document.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Implementation Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting the implementation schedule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental and state organizations commented that EPA should shorten the total implementation period, stating
that staggering implementation up to the year 2000 would delay important emissions benefits. On the other hand, engine
manufacturers asked for one to two years additional time, citing costs and facility constraints. Equipment manufacturers
also asked for one year to eighteen months to implement necessary equipment changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing state and environmental concerns, EPA considered a number of factors in its phase-in schedule determination.
First, the category of engines to be regulated in 1996 represents about 30 percent of the total population. This first
group includes engines similar to existing on-highway engines which can directly utilize the on-highway emission
control strategies and will produce a substantial early benefit. The other three categories of engines belong to
a manufacturing segment of the nonroad industry that has, for the most part, not previously been subject to EPA emission
standards. Manufacturers of these categories of engines have neither the facilities in place to collect required
information nor staff with experience in the certification process. Further, the phase-in schedule was designed
to allow time for the technical development which will be needed for the category of smaller-sized engines to comply
with the standards. Finally, over 95 percent of the total engine population to be regulated will be in compliance by
the 1998 model year. The final category (in the year 2000, engines at or above 560 kW) represents a small percentage
of the yearly sales population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that engine and equipment manufacturers have been provided enough flexibility in this rule (through
such features as ABT for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and staggered schedules) to allow enough lead time for them to make any necessary changes or modifications by the implementation
date. Engine manufacturers have stated that they intend to use the flexibilities of this rule to minimize the impact
of these regulations on their equipment manufacturer customers. EPA designed the phase-in schedule so that smaller
engines, which will be more difficult to control to the adopted NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard, and equipment using these engines, which may require the most modification due to tighter packaging constraints,
have an additional one to two years for development before regulation. Furthermore, early banking allows manufacturers
to selectively forego modifying specific models by collecting credits one year in advance of implementation from
engines that have been made to comply with the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards before the implementation date of the standard. Finally, ABT provides to manufacturers of that small percentage
of engines requiring extensive modification the ongoing option to avoid situations where high cost or tight time
constraints make modifications unreasonable. Therefore, EPA is retaining the implementation schedule as proposed.
No additional time is being granted to engine, vehicle or equipment manufacturers. However, EPA will allow vehicle
and equipment manufacturers a reasonable amount of time after the implementation dates for the different engine
categories so that the equipment and vehicle manufacturers can clear their inventory of unregulated engines.

M. In-use Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed an in-use recall program which included testing of in-use engines. EPA believes that a critical element
in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines that continue to meet emission
standards beyond the certification and production stages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the adopted regulations, EPA has the authority to recall engines which do not comply with emission standards
in-use. As proposed, the in-use testing liability period will be up to seven years or 6,000 hours, whichever occurs
first. This represents 70 to 75 percent of the nonroad engine average expected useful life. The repair period for which
a manufacturer must remedy nonconformities would not be limited by actual years or hours; thus any resulting recall
may be required to be applied to all engines of the recall family, regardless of the years or hours of an individual engine.
In-use compliance with emission standards will be determined based on test results using the same test procedure
as that used in certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern that EPA's recall program carefully select in-use engines which have been properly
maintained and used and that are representative of engines in-use. EPA acknowledges the concern of this commenter.
The Agency conducts its on-highway recall program with careful attention to compliance with the requirements of
the CAA concerning proper maintenance and use, and will continue to do so for the nonroad program, although differences
between uses for on-highway and nonroad equipment may require certain deviations from the on-highway program. EPA
is modeling its large nonroad CI engine recall program after section 207 of the CAA and therefore the Administrator
may require manufacturers to recall applicable engines if a substantial number of properly maintained and used engines
are found to be out of conformity with the regulations issued under section 213 of the CAA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recall regulations adopted today provide procedures and requirements for manufacturers of engines for which
a determination of nonconformity has been made. Such requirements include notification to be sent to engine owners,
the manufacturer's remedial plan and EPA approval of the plan, and procedures to be followed in the event that the manufacturer
requests a public hearing to contest the Administrator's finding of nonconformity.

N. Useful Life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting the definition of useful life as proposed with additional conditions. The useful life of engines covered
by this rule is ten years or 8,000 hours, whichever comes first. Further, the useful life ends when the engine is scrapped
or rebuilt. EPA is adding a provision allowing the manufacturer to apply to the Administrator for a shorter useful
life period for engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment or that are designed specifically
for lower useful life hours to match equipment life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine useful life defines the period of time a manufacturer is liable for the emissions that the engine emits. In-use
surveillance emission testing may be conducted at any time by EPA to determine if an engine family, after some time
in use, is still meeting emission standards. EPA is adopting an in-use testing and recall program based on testing
for a period of seven years or 6,000 hours, representing 70 to 75 percent of the average expected useful life for nonroad
engines. Therefore, while the manufacturer's liability for its engines covers the full useful life, evaluation
of an engine family's in-use compliance will be based on those engines within the engine family that have attained
70 to 75 percent or less of their expected useful life. This not only allows EPA to find more properly maintained and
used engines, but also allows for variation in the durability of different engine configurations within the same
engine family without selecting engines that are at the end of their useful life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While generally agreeing with the ten year/8,000 hour useful life for most engines, manufacturers expressed their
concern that some engine families are expected to have a useful life less than 8,000 hours. These engines are designed
to be used in severe conditions, often in seasonal equipment, or equipment with a short useful life. Manufacturers
are concerned that, should all engines be assumed to last for 8,000 hours, in-use testing of these severe application
engines at 6,000 hours (that is, 75 percent of the useful life) would unfairly penalize severe application engines
that could in fact be outside of their designed shorter useful life. EPA understands that such a situation could exist,
and thus is providing means for the manufacturer to petition the Administrator for an alternative useful life as stated
previously. Solid engineering data should accompany the request so that a reliable engineering judgment can be made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested that EPA adopt a shorter useful life period for engine families with individual cylinder
displacement below a specified volume. It appears that this suggestion was intended to provide a straightforward
method to administer useful life at the time of certification. However, EPA is not aware of a supportable technical
rationale that would suggest there is correlation between cylinder volume and useful life, or that engines with smaller
cylinder volumes wear out faster than engines with larger cylinder volumes. Smaller engines are also installed in
smaller equipment and the relative work expectation is no greater than larger engines in larger equipment. Most engines
covered by this rule are built to operate at full load/rated speed most of the time. Therefore, in relative terms, engines
are generally equally stressed during their lifetime regardless of their size or power. For these reasons, EPA does
not believe it is appropriate to define a shorter useful life for all engines under a specified cylinder volume. EPA
has provided a means for a manufacturer to provide evidence that would allow severe service engines to be held to a shorter
useful life.

EPA proposed to exclude engines used to propel locomotives from this rulemaking, as regulation of such engines is
being undertaken separately. EPA did not, however, exclude other engines operated on locomotives from this rulemaking.
EPA requested comment as to whether such other engines (``auxiliary engines'') should be regulated in this or the
later locomotives action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received several comments on this issue. The commenters all noted that auxiliary engines are appropriately regulated
under section 213(a)(5) as ``engines used in locomotives.'' EPA agrees with this determination and is promulgating
a definition of ``engines used in locomotives'' that corresponds to this determination. While there was general
agreement with the regulatory authority under which auxiliary engines used on locomotives can be regulated, comments
were received both agreeing and disagreeing with EPA's proposal that the auxiliary engines should be regulated in
today's rulemaking action. EPA believes that the statutory mandate of section 213(a)(5) allows EPA to regulate auxiliary
engines in this rulemaking. Moreover, the standard under which such engines are to be regulated is virtually identical
to the standard under section 213(a)(3). EPA also received comments indicating that auxiliary engines are similar
in design and performance to other nonroad engines regulated in this rulemaking, and that such engines should therefore
be regulated in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is including auxiliary large CI engines operated on locomotives in this rulemaking. This issue is
discussed further in the Response to Comments in the docket.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing the requirement that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers use certified
nonroad engines. EPA believes that the most effective way to ensure that certified engines are used in nonroad vehicles
and equipment is to require such engines to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA stated that CAA section 213 provides authority to require nonroad vehicle and equipment
manufacturers to use certified nonroad engines. However, EPA did not propose such a requirement. Instead, EPA requested
comment on how it might assure that only certified nonroad engines be used in nonroad vehicles and equipment. EPA received
comments on this issue from a State and an environmental association. Both comments requested that nonroad vehicle
and equipment manufacturers be required to use certified nonroad engines. One comment agreed that EPA has authority
under CAA section 213 to establish such a requirement, and the other pointed out that the entire program would be undercut
without such a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the October 4, 1993 notice, EPA proposed requiring nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers
to use certified nonroad engines. EPA received 12 comments on this issue, from six companies, four industry associations,
one State, and one environmental association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters opposed the establishment of this requirement. One company argued that failure to require use of certified
engines would not undercut the program because engine inventories are already kept to a minimum as their purchase
is a significant investment. An association argued that without a technical support document and regulatory language,
it could not comment meaningfully. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that industry inventory control practices can take the place of a requirement that certified nonroad
engines be used in nonroad vehicles and equipment. Without a requirement that certified engines be used, nonroad
vehicle and equipment manufacturers would be free to use uncertified engines, thus undermining the environmental
and public health benefits of the nonroad large CI engine emission reduction program. EPA is not requiring vehicle
or equipment manufacturers to be responsible for certification or performance of nonroad engines; that is the responsibility
of the engine manufacturer. The final regulations merely prohibit nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers
from using uncertified nonroad engines in their nonroad vehicles and equipment. Violation of this prohibition would
be a violation of CAA section 203(a), and would subject nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers to sanctions
under sections 204 and 205. EPA does not agree that the October 4, 1993 notice was so lacking in specificity as to require
reproposal. In fact, this prohibition was clearly discussed in the October 4 notice. EPA does not find regulatory
language regarding prohibited acts to have been required in the October 4 notice because such language would have
only restated the requirement that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers must use certified nonroad engines.
That requirement was clearly spelled out in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters agreed with the requirement. Of the two companies that supported the requirement, one stated
that the responsibility of vehicle and equipment manufacturers should be limited to assuring that engines have emission
compliance labels, and that engine manufacturers should be responsible for certification, testing, audits, warranty,
and recall. A State that supported the requirement said it is the only way to ensure that certified engines are used.
An environmental association said the requirement should improve the enforceability of the rule. EPA agrees with
these comments. The nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturer is responsible only for assuring that certified
engines are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters neither agreed nor disagreed with the requirement but raised questions regarding it. Several
commenters asked about the use of noncertified engines built prior to the implementation dates of this regulation.
Several commenters requested implementation dates for vehicles and equipment, to provide sufficient lead time
for engine manufacturers to produce certified engines for vehicle and equipment manufacturers to use. Two commenters
stated that an implementation date for engine manufacturers was sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not establishing separate implementation dates for nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers. However,
EPA recognizes that certified engines are not likely to be available in the numbers needed by nonroad vehicle and equipment
manufacturers on the implementation date, and that vehicle and equipment manufacturers will continue to use noncertified
engines built prior to the implementation date until noncertified engine inventories are used up and certified engines
are available. As long as vehicle and equipment manufacturers do not inventory engines outside of normal business
practices (that is, as long as they do not stockpile noncertified engines), vehicle and equipment manufacturers
will be considered to be in compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another question raised by several commenters regards products intended for export. Commenters asked whether engine
manufacturers can continue to produce noncertified engines for export, and whether noncertified engines may be
imported for use in nonroad vehicles and equipment intended for export. One commenter requested an exemption from
liability for engine and equipment manufacturers if nonroad vehicles or equipment sold for export are used in the
U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation does not prohibit import of noncertified engines for use in nonroad vehicles and equipment intended
for export. As originally proposed, the exemption for repair and alteration in 40 CFR 89.611&hyph;96(b)(1) will
allow the import under bond of noncertified engines for use in vehicles and equipment intended for export. Further,
this regulation does not prohibit the manufacture of noncertified engines intended for export. Manufacture of noncertified
engines intended for export is allowed under the conditions specified in 40 CFR 89.909&hyph;96(a), as originally
proposed. EPA is not providing a blanket exemption from liability for nonroad manufacturers whose products, intended
for export, are used in the U.S. Such manufacturers may, in fact, be liable for sanctions. Each case must be determined
on its own merits.

Q. Alternative Fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency proposed that the use of alternative fuels would not be necessary to comply with the emission standards,
but allowed any manufacturer wanting to use alternative fuels to petition the Administrator for approval of alternative
test procedures appropriate for that fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters addressed alternative fuels. One argued that alternative-fueled CI engines should be exempt from
regulation because of increased costs and increased competition with non-CI alternative-fueled engines. The other
commenter stated that EPA should include all natural gas engines in this regulation, establish better test procedures
as soon as possible, and allow these engines to certify to the same standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will adopt as proposed its provisions to include alternative fuel CI engines. No data were provided to support
any of the statements made by commenters. EPA still believes that including alternative fuel engines is appropriate.
Any additional cost for these engines to certify is small and comparable to that of diesel fueled engines. EPA reserves
the right to adjust standards when necessary, such as adjusting the HC standard to its non-methane equivalent, for
certain alternative fuels.

R. Selective Enforcement Auditing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a number of comments on its proposed Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program for large nonroad
CI engines. The proposed nonroad SEA program was designed to be similar to the existing on-highway program for heavy-duty
motor vehicle engines, with some modifications to accommodate differences between the two industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments indicate that industry understands EPA's need for the SEA program, but concern was expressed regarding
EPA's proposed changes from the on-highway program to adapt to the large nonroad CI engine industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to determine annual limits for the number of SEAs a manufacturer would receive. Each passing audit counts
as one toward a manufacturer's annual limit. EPA's on-highway light-duty vehicle (LDV), light-duty truck (LDT)
and heavy-duty engine (HDE) programs determine annual limits by dividing a manufacturer's projected annual production
by 300,000 for LDV and LDT manufacturers and 30,000 for HDE manufacturers, then rounding to the nearest whole number.
If the calculated production factor is less than one, the figure is set at one for that manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To compensate for differences between the on-highway and nonroad industries, EPA proposed that nonroad engine manufacturers'
annual limits would be determined by first calculating two annual limit factors, the production factor and the family
factor. These factors respectively represent the maximum number of audits based on yearly annual sales and on the
number of engine families produced in that model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production factor was derived from the annual limits currently used in the on-highway SEA programs and the relative
contributions of emissions from on-highway and nonroad sources. EPA proposed that the production factor should
be the projected annual nonroad engine sales of each manufacturer divided by 9,500 and rounded to the nearest whole
number. If the calculated production factor is less than one, the figure is set at one for that manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The family factor was proposed as an alternative method to compensate for situations where manufacturers may have
low production but a large number of engine families. EPA proposed that the family factor would be determined by dividing
the number of engine families certified by the manufacturer in a given model year by five and rounding to the nearest
whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to use whichever value is higher of either the production factor or the family factor as the annual limit
of SEAs for a manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers commented that EPA was putting a larger SEA burden on nonroad manufacturers than on on-highway manufacturers.
They recommended eliminating the family factor and that annual limits be determined, as in the on-highway HDE SEA
program, by dividing by 30,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual limits were also discussed at the public hearing for this rule on June 30, 1993. At that time EPA expressed concern
that if a manufacturer were assigned an annual limit of one, and that manufacturer passed an SEA early in the model year,
the incentive to maintain close control over emissions may decrease or the desire to establish very low emission limits
to maximize credits in an averaging program might increase the risk of noncompliance. Similarly, the manufacturer
could modify its production to increase emissions with the knowledge that no more SEAs would likely be assigned during
that model year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided to revise its proposed production factor method for determining annual limits. As commented upon,
EPA's proposed production factor analysis did not take into consideration projected emission reductions for large
nonroad CI engines. EPA estimated that the emission contribution for large nonroad CI engines is approximately half
of the contribution for on-highway sources. However, EPA estimates that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from nonroad engines will decrease by approximately 37 percent by the year 2025 or when a complete fleet
turnover occurs. Therefore, EPA reevaluated its production factor analysis and determined that the production
factor divisor should be 16,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to retain the family factor method for determining annual limits. This method was proposed to help
compensate for the expected low annual production per engine family and for the possible multitude of engine families
with relatively few SEAs per manufacturer to check compliance. EPA estimates that the average annual production
per engine family for large nonroad CI engines, even with the expanded engine family definition, will be less than
one tenth and less than one twentieth the average production of on-highway HDE and combined LDV/LDT engine families
respectively. Consequently, EPA believes the family factor in combination with the production factor is necessary
to assign annual limits to large nonroad CI engine manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the on-highway program, a goal of the nonroad SEA program is to encourage manufacturers to perform self-auditing.
Some manufacturers commented that EPA should develop specific guidelines for counting self-auditing against manufacturers'
annual limits. Additionally, it was suggested that EPA should count audits conducted by CARB toward annual limits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes the time, effort and cost manufacturers expend on self-audit testing and considers the quality, scope
and effectiveness of such programs when assigning audits to a manufacturer. However, EPA's on-highway HDE SEA program
has had audit failures even when a manufacturer's self-auditing showed that engines were in compliance with standards.
Consequently, EPA believes that spot checks of manufacturer's self-audit programs by SEAs are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria governing the assignment of audits are too numerous and interconnected to make specific guidelines
relating self-auditing to annual limits useful. For instance, a manufacturer with a comprehensive self-audit program
who is reluctant to remedy deficiencies and fails SEAs warrants continued attention by EPA just as a manufacturer
with a minimal program is likely to receive few SEAs if it routinely designs and produces engines well below emission
standards. Likewise, manufacturers who set unusually low FELs in averaging programs will be subject to extra scrutiny.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantial consideration will be given to assembly line testing required by CARB on engine families sold nationwide
when the CARB test protocols (for example, sampling plan) are as stringent as EPA's. While EPA will not reduce its annual
limits based on CARB audits, it will work together with CARB to exchange emission test data and consequently more efficiently
assess compliance with applicable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers will be notified of SEAs by means of a test order. EPA proposed that the test order would specify the engine
family to be audited, or EPA could specify an engine configuration or range of configurations from a family to be audited.
Manufacturers commented that, by auditing engine families, EPA could be significantly increasing the SEA burden
on manufacturers. However, as indicated in the NPRM, EPA planned to consider requests by manufacturers to exclude
particular engines or configurations from test samples for reasons such as urgent customer orders or to minimize
test cell set-up time. EPA still plans to consider those requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed that imported engines could be selected at ports of entry or storage locations in the U.S. SEA engines
are typically selected from the point of final engine assembly or from a storage or shipping facility. Manufacturers
commented that selecting foreign-produced engines at ports should be an option but not a requirement. Comments also
indicated that port selections could significantly increase the manufacturers' SEA costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as indicated in the NPRM, manufacturers could designate selection locations to minimize disruption and
shipping costs. EPA would not likely select engines for SEAs that are only imported installed in equipment; instead,
SEAs of those engines would usually occur during foreign trips by SEA staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total number of engines tested in an SEA will be dictated by the number of engines required to reach the statistically
acceptable pass/fail decision within the sampling plan applied. As in the on-highway program, these sampling plans
were designed to meet a 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to use the same sampling plans used for the on-highway HDE SEA program with two revisions. The proposed
revisions were to include a sampling plan (Plan AA) for lower production engines and to permit the use of the on-highway
sampling plan A on families with projected production between 20 and 99 engines. Plan AA was proposed as an option for
families with projected annual production between 20 and 50 engines and to permit an audit pass decision in as few as
three tests with a maximum of 20 tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers requested that EPA provide further flexibility in the use of sampling plans. It was requested that
EPA make each sampling plan available for manufacturers regardless of the audited engine's projected annual production.
It was also requested that EPA permit the use of CARB's low-volume sampling plan which permits a pass decision in as
few as two tests and has a maximum test sample of ten engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not adopting CARB's low-volume sampling plan for the SEA program. EPA believes this sampling plan's consumer
risk is too great to justify its use in a federal emission compliance program. However, EPA may consider requests by
manufacturers to terminate testing early during SEAs of low production families when the audit results are significantly
and consistently below each applicable standard or FEL, and selection of additional engines would be difficult or
cause a delay in shipment of customer-ordered engines, or the manufacturer's test facility does not have sufficient
capacity to expeditiously conclude the SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, failure of an SEA may result in suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that engine
family. To have the certificate reinstated subsequent to a suspension, or reissued subsequent to a revocation, the
manufacturer must demonstrate, by showing passing data that improvements, modifications, or replacement have
brought the family into compliance. The regulations include hearing provisions which allow the manufacturer to
challenge EPA's suspension or revocation decision based on application of the sampling plans or the manner in which
tests were conducted.

 standard while achieving a target level of environmental benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the inclusion of ABT. Others opposed the program. One commenter believes that the program
would be overly complex, difficult to enforce, and would decrease the effectiveness of the standard by increasing
the overall emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. The target level of environmental benefits was proposed with ABT in mind. In EPA's opinion, and as discussed
in the NPRM, the flexibilities afforded by ABT are appropriate to achieve the 9.2 g/kW-hr NO

2. Participation of California-certified Engines in ABT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that engines sold in California and subject to California emissions standards would not be included
in the federal ABT program. EPA also proposed that engines sold in California but preempted from California regulation
or not subject to California emission standards (primarily construction and farm equipment below 130 kW (175 hp))
be eligible to participate in ABT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter preferred to have a 50-state credit exchange program which would include all engines shipped to all
50 states regardless of the state regulations. Other commenters believed that the engines subject to state regulations
should be excluded from participation in the program. Also, one commenter preferred that all engines sent to California
not be included in the federal ABT program and recommended the compromise of having a California-only averaging set.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that to maintain the effectiveness of the separate California and national emission standards, any
engines both sold in California and subject to California regulations (or both subject to regulations and sold in
other states that adopt California's regulations under section 209(e)(2)(B)) should not be allowed to participate
in the federal ABT program. Although a 50-state scenario would reduce the tracking burden on manufacturers, reduced
tracking burden is not a sufficient reason in EPA's opinion to include California engines. Because California does
not allow ABT, all engines both sold in the California market and subject to California regulations will be at or below
the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard finalized by EPA today. Therefore, including these engines in the national average could cause the average
emissions of engines in the other 49 states to exceed the standard. Finally, engines sold in California but not subject
to California emission regulations are subject to federal regulations and, thus, may participate in ABT.

3. Power Ratings for Credit Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to calculate credits by taking the difference between the standard and the FEL, times the sales volume
of engines participating in the program, times the power rating. The power rating was proposed to be the largest power
rating within an engine family for those families using credits, and the smallest rating within an engine family for
families generating credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters claimed that the proposed method for determining the power rating for credit calculations translates
into a significant (greater than 50 percent) reduction in the number of credits generated and an increase in the number
of credits used. They recommended that families be divided into subfamilies, and the most environmentally-safe
power rating be drawn from each subfamily for credit calculations. An engine family would have to consist of a broad
range of power ratings to realize either a 50 percent reduction in credit generation or a 50 percent increase in credit
use. EPA stated in the NPRM that it would not allow multi-configuration engine families to be arbitrarily divided
into multiple engine families to maximize credit generation or minimize credit usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in those specific cases where such a broad range of power ratings occur in one family, a manufacturer would
likely be able to demonstrate, consistent with &sect;89.116&hyph;96(d) of the regulations, that the expected useful
life emission characteristics of some configurations within a broad engine family warrant a separate engine family
designation. This would mitigate the credit reduction caused by extremely broad engine families while maintaining
EPA's intent that subcategories not be established for the sole purpose of maximizing credits.

4. Discounting of Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed ABT program did not include a discount on credits. The proposal did specify a first in, first out (FIFO)
accounting system for credits used in averaging (see &sect;89.204&hyph;96(b)); this effectively extends FIFO
to banking and trading because in order to ultimately use banked or traded credits, they must be averaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters approved of the absence of a discount on banked or traded credits. One commenter disapproved because
discounting, which is included in the on-highway heavy duty averaging program, is viewed as ensuring that a tangible
environmental benefit will accrue from a banking program. This commenter would prefer a reduction in available banked
credits through discounting or the use of a last in, first out (LIFO) accounting system to mitigate this effect over
time.

 The rationale for the credit discount was two-fold. First, additional environmental benefits were desired from
banking and trading over and above the benefits produced from the averaging program already in place when banking
and trading were added. Credit discounting was determined to be an appropriate method of providing a tangible environmental
benefit, so that both manufacturers and the public would share the benefits created by the addition of banking and
trading. Second, EPA believed that the amount of the discount would not be a disincentive toward participation in
the program. Although a credit discount may be appropriate for the on-highway heavy duty ABT program, where banking
and trading were promulgated separately from averaging, EPA is not promulgating a credit discount for today's action.
The level of environmental benefits, the level of the emission standard, and the banking and trading components of
the ABT program were determined in conjunction with one another. Therefore, a credit discount for today's action
is not necessary.

One commenter requested that if EPA was not requiring discounting, the Agency should require the use of LIFO as a means
to minimize the value of early banking and of banking in general. Under a FIFO accounting system, older banked credits
must be used in the current year's average before credits generated in the current year. This potentially allows manufacturers
to bank all the current year's credits, which will have a three year potential credit life, if manufacturers are able
to use previously-banked credits or purchased credits to offset those engines with FELs above the standard. This
encourages manufacturers to achieve more emissions reductions earlier, which may be beneficial for the environment.
Mandating a LIFO accounting system may discourage early emission reductions and was not proposed by the Agency.

5. Allowing Early Banking of Emission Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters supported EPA's proposal to allow manufacturers to bank credits one year in advance of the implementation
date in order to provide incentives to introduce clean technology a year early. One commenter suggested allowing
early banking starting in 1995 regardless of the phase-in implementation date. One commenter believed that early
banking should be excluded in order to prevent the generation of windfall credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that incentives should be provided for manufacturers to make early use of clean technology. This
consideration outweighs the Agency's concerns regarding the minimal number of credits that may be generated a year
in advance by the small percentage of engines which already meet the upcoming standard. EPA presented an analysis
in the NPRM demonstrating that credits from this small percentage of engines did not represent significant windfall
credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA supports early banking incentives for the introduction of clean technology, EPA does not support allowing
early banking starting in 1995 regardless of the phase-in implementation date. EPA proposed the phase-in implementation
dates because many manufacturers had informed EPA that additional leadtime is necessary for particular sizes of
engines. Although it would be beneficial to the environment to have clean engines introduced earlier, EPA is not allowing
early banking beyond one year because the larger number of engine families and the extended years of early banking
would increase the potential of windfall credits.

 emissions below 9.2 g/kW-hr and could generate credits up to the 9.2 g/kW-hr according to &sect;89.207&hyph;96 and
bank these credits for future use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the idea of early banking. However, several commenters disagreed on the credit generation
level. Some commenters recommended that, to create an incentive for manufacturers to meet the standards early, they
should be allowed to generate credits up to 11.9 g/kW-hr. Another commenter opposed the credit generation level of
11.9 g/kW-hr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it is inappropriate to establish a credit generation level above 9.2 g/kW-hr due to the possibility
of windfall credits. EPA did not receive data to indicate that emission credits granted to industry at the 11.9 g/kW-hr
level would be, overall, less than or equal to the environmental benefits gained by the early banking program. Therefore,
manufacturers participating in early banking may only generate credits up to 9.2 g/kW-hr.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has substantial experience in enforcement of vehicle and engine emissions from the on-highway ABT program. This
experience will be carried forward to the nonroad program. EPA will ensure that manufacturers are held responsible
for meeting the FELs that they set, that the FELs are carefully monitored by means of the SEA program, and that overall
compliance is effectively monitored. Further, manufacturers will not be allowed to use credits to remedy FEL exceedances
detected by EPA enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the connection between credit information and confidential sales information, EPA regulations concerning
the release of confidential business information have restricted the public's opportunity to review manufacturers'
submission of credit generation and usage. EPA is currently discussing with the participating manufacturers in
the on-highway ABT program the possibility of implementing a means of allowing the public to access enough information
to make general assessments about the effectiveness of the ABT program on a regular basis. The Engine Manufacturers
Association concurs that it is important to provide an ongoing opportunity for the public to evaluate the overall
progress of the program. EPA and EMA expect to finalize an agreement in the near future on the periodic release of credit
data in a format that would be useful to the public.

Defining the term nonroad equipment is a logical outgrowth of this rulemaking, is in keeping with the intent of Congress,
and clarifies EPA's use of the term. EPA also notes that the definition of the term ``nonroad vehicle'' has been revised
to match the statutory definition; instead of defining nonroad vehicles as vehicles propelled by nonroad engines,
they are defined as vehicles powered by nonroad engines.

U. Definition of New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the September 6, 1991 NPRM proposing regulations under section 209(e) of the CAA regarding preemption of state
nonroad regulations, EPA proposed a definition of ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle.'' In that NPRM,
EPA defined ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle'' to mean a nonroad engine or a nonroad vehicle the equitable
or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. EPA did not provide a definition of ``new''
in its May 17, 1993 NPRM because EPA expected that the definition of ``new'' promulgated in the context of the section
209(e) rulemaking would control how ``new'' would be defined in this rule. However, EPA has not yet promulgated its
section 209(e) regulations. Therefore, EPA is finalizing a definition of ``new'' in this rulemaking relying in part
on the definition proposed in the September 6, 1991 NPRM and the comments received in response to that NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimate purchaser was proposed to be defined as the first person who in good faith purchases such a new nonroad vehicle
or nonroad engine for purposes other than resale. Additionally, with respect to imported nonroad engines, EPA proposed
to define ``new'' nonroad engine to be a nonroad engine manufactured after the effective date of a regulation issued
under section 213 which would be applicable to such engine had it been manufactured for importation into the United
States. These definitions also applied to ``new locomotives'' and ``new engines used in locomotives.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on EPA's proposed definition of ``new'' were several. First, CARB, the San Diego Air Pollution Control Board
(SDAPCB), and the Manufacturers of Emissions Controls Association (MECA) supported EPA's definition. CARB asked
that EPA clarify which regulatory activities states may perform; for example, whether states may require in-use
testing and impose add-on or retrofit requirements. On the other hand, many commenters, including U.S. Representative
Terry Bruce, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI), the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the
Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association (PPEMA), opposed EPA's proposed definition and proposed that
``new'' should mean manufactured after either the effective date of the Clean Air Act Amendments, November 15, 1990,
or after federal regulations take effect. These commenters believe that Congress intended an ``absolute'' preemption.
That is, the nonroad engines and vehicles in the preempted categories manufactured after November 15, 1990 would
never be subject to any kind of state emission regulation. EMA commented that if EPA does not accept the latter definition,
it should expand its proposed definition so that engines remain ``new'' until they have exceeded their useful life.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters in the railroad industry also supported a definition of ``new'' as ``manufactured after November 1990''
and stated further that the railroad industry has traditionally been preempted from state regulation, such as in
the area of safety. The same commenters indicated that they believe that state control of locomotive emissions or
state enforcement of federal standards would interfere with interstate commerce. Railroad commenters also stated
that any standards for rebuilt or remanufactured engines or locomotives should be uniform federal standards_not
state standards. Furthermore, if remanufactured engines were rebuilt to comply with such federal standards, they
should be considered ``new''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also opposed the proposed definition regarding imported vehicles and engines because the definition
of ``new'' was different depending upon whether the nonroad engine was produced domestically or abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed definitions for ``new nonroad vehicles'' and ``new nonroad engines'' parallel the definitions of
``new motor vehicles'' and ``new motor vehicle engines'' in section 216 of the Clean Air Act. The definition of ``new''
proposed for imported nonroad engines was intended to address nonconforming engines which may become subject to
federal emission requirements at the time the engine or vehicle is imported into the United States. The Agency has
decided to delete this definition of ``new'' for imported engines. EPA agrees with the commenters that imports and
domestic products should generally be treated alike for regulatory purposes. Today's rule treats domestic and imported
nonroad engines the same way for purposes of determining whether they are new. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule establishes for the purpose of these federal regulations, a definition of ``new'' as it applies to
all domestically manufactured and imported ``new nonroad engines,'' ``new nonroad vehicles,'' and ``new nonroad
equipment.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment are defined as engines, vehicles, and equipment the equitable or legal
title to which has not been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. The ultimate purchaser is defined as the first person
who in good faith purchases such engine, vehicle, or equipment for purposes other than resale. For some engines, vehicles,
or equipment the passage of title in the United States may not formally occur or manufacturers may retain title and
lease the engines or equipment. In these cases, a domestic or imported nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad
equipment will retain its status as ``new'' until such engine or vehicle is ``placed into service.'' An engine, vehicle,
or equipment is considered ``placed into service'' when the engine, vehicle, or equipment is used for its functional
purposes. EPA believes that the definition of new should include the ``placed into service'' addition to the motor
vehicle definition of new found in section 216 of the Act because of the nature of the nonroad market. Nonroad engines,
nonroad vehicles and nonroad equipment are often leased and maintained by the manufacturer well into the useful life
of the nonroad equipment. A piece of equipment, the title of which has passed to the ultimate purchaser, should not
be treated differently than a piece of equipment which is being used but has not yet passed to an ultimate purchaser.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that this definition of ``new'' comports with the language, intent and structure of the Clean
Air Act and is a permissible construction of the statute. Contrary to the assertion of some commenters, EPA's definition
of ``new'' is consistent with the dictionary definition of the word as ``having existed or been made but a short time.''
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1990. Generally speaking, manufactured products are sold soon after
they are made and are considered new until they are sold or used. The commenters' definition of new_anything manufactured
after the Clean Air Act Amendments' enactment or an applicable regulation's promulgation_would mean, by contrast,
that any engine manufactured after a certain date would be new forever. This is certainly not the plain meaning of ``new.''
Congress could have stated that the federal preemption applied to certain equipment manufactured after a certain
date, but Congress did not do so. Elsewhere in title II, Congress specified that a provision only applied to products
manufactured after a certain date (see, section 218 requiring a ban on engines manufactured after the 1992 model year
that require leaded gasoline) or first introduced into commerce after a certain date (see, section 211(f) regarding
prohibition on fuels that are not substantially similar to fuels used to certify vehicles as meeting emission standards).
The lack of such a date here further supports that Congress intended ``new'' to mean newly manufactured and not yet
sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative record also shows Congressional intent that ``new'' should refer to newly manufactured products.
In his colloquy with Senator Wilson explaining the final version of section 209(e), Senator Chafee notes that ``because
the preemption is limited to new engine standards only, States can continue to require existing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and in-use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonroad engines to reduce emissions *&blank;*&blank;*'' [Emphasis added] 136 Cong. Rec. S17237 (October 26, 1990).
This language is echoed by similar language from Senator Baucus in his report to the Senate on the conference bill.
136 Cong. Rec. S16976 (October 27, 1990). If Congress intended the definition of new nonroad engines or equipment,
and as a result the preemption, to apply to an engine for its entire life, then it would appear that there would be no distinction
between new and in-use nonroad engines, as an engine manufactured after a certain date would always be new. Yet the
statements of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus clearly contemplate such a distinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with the way the Act approaches motor vehicle emission control.
As noted earlier, section 216 defines new in the context of motor vehicles as ``a motor vehicle the equitable or legal
title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.'' The Act applies federal emissions standards
to ``new'' vehicles. These federal standards are enforced through certification, assembly line, and recall testing.
States, on the other hand, have a role in motor vehicle emission control through inspection/maintenance programs
and are not restricted from controlling used vehicles. The section 209(a) prohibition of state regulation of motor
vehicles addresses only ``new'' motor vehicles and engines and prohibits state regulation that occurs before sale,
titling, or registration of the vehicle.

Section 209(a) provides, in part, ``.&blank;.&blank;. No State shall require certification, inspection, or any
other approval relating to the control of emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine as condition
precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if any), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 take a parallel approach to nonroad standards and enforcement. Section 213 provides
EPA with authority to set standards for ``new'' engines and provides for federal enforcement of such standards in
the same manner as motor vehicle enforcement. Furthermore, nothing on the face of section 209(e) or section 213 indicates
that Congress intended ``new'' to be interpreted differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle contexts.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Given that the preemption provisions for new motor vehicles and new nonroad engines appear in the same section of the
Clean Air Act, it is reasonable to believe that Congress did not intend for the word ``new'' to be defined differently
within the same section without stating this intent explicitly.

Much of the argument below discusses the definition of ``new'' as applied to section 209 of the statute. However, these
arguments are equally valid for the purposes of defining ``new'' under section 213, especially given the integrated
nature of Part A of Title II, the legislative and statutory history, and practical necessity. For example, consistent
definitions of new under sections 209 and 213 are likely to ensure that there are no unintended gaps in regulation or
unintended dual regulation. Also, the statutory definition of ``new motor vehicle'' and ``new motor vehicle engine''
are applicable equally to federal regulations and preemption of state regulations. EPA generally sees no logical
reason to treat nonroad engines differently. However, see the discussion in footnote 21.

EPA recognizes that regulation of locomotives presents unique circumstances, including questions regarding interstate
commerce, that require special attention. EPA therefore believes that the definition of ``new'' as used in ``new
locomotive'' and ``new engine used in a locomotive'' may need to be treated differently for the purposes of determining
preemption of state regulation under section 209(e) than it is treated for the purpose of federal regulation under
section 213(a). This issue will be addressed in a later rulemaking.

There is not a compelling policy or factual justification for defining new differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle
contexts. State regulation of nonroad engines does not generally present any greater degree of disruption of the
movement of products, engines or equipment between states than does regulation of motor vehicles. The comments provide
little if any justification, in terms of relevant distinctions between motor vehicles and nonroad engines, to justify
such a significant departure from EPA's established practice for regulating mobile sources.

 the court held that where the exercise of local police power serves the purpose of a federal act_the Clean Air Act in
that case_the preemptive effect of the act should be narrowly construed. In keeping with that principle, EPA believes
that the definition of ``new'' should be construed narrowly in order to protect states' rights, particularly in an
area such as public health in which states traditionally exercise control. California's nonroad regulations will
serve the purpose of the federal act by improving air quality.

EPA believes that the further a state requirement is removed in time from the manufacture and distribution of new engines,
the less interstate commerce is likely to be burdened. Furthermore, the legality of particular regulatory controls
that a state may impose on nonroad vehicles or engines that are no longer new will depend upon the burden that such controls

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allway Taxi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stated that a state or locality is not free to impose its own emission control measures the moment after a new car is bought
and registered. ``That would be an obvious circumvention of the Clean Air Act and would defeat the congressional purpose
of preventing obstruction to interstate commerce.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The court further stated that federal preemption does not, however, preclude a state from imposing its own exhaust
emission control standards upon the resale or reregistration of the automobile. Furthermore, states are not precluded
from setting standards for licensing of vehicles for commercial use. These types of regulations, which are more removed,
``would cause only minimal interference with interstate commerce, since they would be directed primarily to intrastate
activities and the burden of compliance would be on individual owners and in-state users and not on manufacturers
and distributors.''

 EPA believes that the requirements of section 209(e)(2) apply only to new nonroad engines and vehicles. The requirements
of section 209(e)(2) are only required for nonroad engines and vehicles the regulation of which has been preempted.
The language of section 209(e)(2) does not state any clear preemption, either for new or in use vehicles. The only clear
preemption of state regulation of nonroad engines occurs in section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a).

In-use testing and recall programs of the type set forth in section 207 ensure compliance with standards required
to be met by manufacturers at the time of certification of the engine. Because these in-use standards relate to the
original manufacture of the engine and place the burden of compliance upon the manufacturer, they are deemed to be
standards affecting a new motor vehicle or a new nonroad engine and thus require a waiver under the criteria of section
209(b) or 209(e)(2) respectively.

Section 209(a) applies to nonroad vehicles because of the language of section 213(d) of the Act, which specifically
requires that EPA's standards regulating nonroad engines and vehicles be subject to sections 206, 207, 208 and 209
of the Act, with such modifications of the applicable regulations as the Administrator deems appropriate. Thus,
Congress clearly anticipated that all of section 209 would be applicable to nonroad engines. Subsections (a) through
(d) of section 209 do not specifically reference nonroad engines, nor do sections 206, 207 or 208. However, the language
of section 213(d) clearly is intended to apply such provisions to nonroad engines. Further indication of Congress'
intent is the language of the last sentence of section 209(e)(1), which states that subsection 209(b) does not apply
for purposes of subsection (e)(1). (Section 209(b) provides the procedure under which California can receive a waiver
of section 209(a) preemption for motor vehicles.) This sentence would not have been necessary unless subsection
209(a) through (d) otherwise applied.

Another indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to most in-use regulations of nonroad engines
is the fact that neither the Senate nor the House version of the 1990 Act amendments would have preempted state regulation
of anything but new nonroad engines. Neither version would have expressly preempted regulation in use. It would be
unusual for a bill to come out of conference with a broader preemption than existed in either house and without any mention
in the legislative history that such broader preemption had been mandated. In fact, both Senators Chafee and Baucus
believed that the scope of the preemption had been narrowed from the House bill, not widened.

Both Senators declare that state preemption is limited to new locomotives and new small farm and construction equipment.
Both mention that states may still regulate other new nonroad equipment, presumably after receiving EPA approval.
Finally, each declare that states also fully retain existing authority to regulate emissions from all types of existing
or in-use nonroad engines by specifying fuel quality specifications, operational modes or characteristics or measures
that limit the use of nonroad engines or equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fact, as the legislative history indicates, it appears that Congress intended the preemption provisions of section
209, as applied to nonroad engines, to be analogous to the preemption provisions as applied to motor vehicles, except
that California cannot request any waiver of the Federal preemption of state regulation of new small farm and construction
equipment and locomotives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to in-use regulations is the fact that, if the
subsection were applied to in-use regulations, then California would be the only government (local, state or federal)
that could directly set regulations for nonroad engines in use. EPA's mandate under section 213 applies only to new
engines. Therefore, EPA will not promulgate standards for in-use regulation of nonroad engines under section 213,
beyond in-use regulations normally associated with new certified engines (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in-use testing and recall requirements under section 207). States other than California would not be able to regulate
nonroad engines in use (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 operation controls under section 209(d)) until California regulates them and could only regulate them in a manner
identical to California's regulations. Nothing in the legislative history indicates such a dramatic departure
from the current ability of states and local authorities to regulate emissions of mobile sources in use. Therefore,
if section 209(e)(2) is determined to apply to in-use regulations, the entire United States regulatory scheme for
regulation of nonroad engines in use would be dependent on the actions of one state, California. Congress could not
have meant to grant such plenary power to a single state.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is especially true given the location-specific nature of in-use regulations. In-use regulations, such as time
of use or place of use restrictions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 high occupancy vehicle lanes) are typically very site specific. An in-use regulation suitable for California, or
in part of California, may have little or no relevance or practicality to the type of in-use regulation suitable for
another area. Such regulations which primarily effect local users are more appropriately controlled and implemented
by local and state governments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, section 209(d) of the Act clearly limits the preemption of state regulation in use. It states that ``nothing
in this part shall preclude or deny to any other State or political subdivision thereof the right otherwise to control,
regulate, or restrict the use, operation or movement of registered or licensed motor vehicles.'' As was stated above,
section 209 as a whole applies equally to nonroad engines. Thus, section 209(d) should be interpreted to mean that,
unless state regulation of use of nonroad engines is specifically preempted, section 209 should not be interpreted
to grant any implicit preemption, except within the framework of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the language of section 209 and the lack of any express preemption, the legislative history of these provisions,
and the general presumption against providing broad preemption where such preemption is not made explicit, EPA believes
that it is clear that section 209(e)(2) does not apply to in use regulation of nonroad engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA recognizes the important principle of narrowly construing the preemptive effect of the Act as explained
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allway Taxi,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA also notes that certain state regulations that may be characterized as ``in-use'' regulations may be preempted
because they are effectively regulations on the design of new engines rather than on the use of ``in-use'' engines.
Industry has expressed concern that states might impose retrofit requirements on nonroad engines and vehicles as
soon as they are introduced into commerce, or when such engines are being rebuilt, or at a date after which nonroad engines
are typically rebuilt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA recognizes that CARB does not envision a retrofit requirement and that, because of the nature of the nonroad market,
it is unlikely that other states would adopt such a requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, given EPA's definition of new and the scope of the definition within this rulemaking, this issue could arise
when other states plan their in-use emission strategy. In such a case, EPA believes that a retrofit requirement mandating
a retrofit of a nonroad engine immediately after the engine is no longer new is adverse to the Congressional intent
of section 209(e) and the principles laid out in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allway Taxi.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, in this scenario, such a retrofit requirement would be deemed an in-use emission standard relating back
to the original design of the new engine by the original engine manufacturer (OEM) and would be subject to the waiver
criteria of section 209(e)(2). Within this same scenario, only California could adopt such a requirement and other
states could only adopt California's requirement if California subsequently was granted a waiver. However, after
a reasonable amount of time has passed and the engine is no longer new (most likely when an engine is being rebuilt),
modest retrofit requirements would most likely not be deemed to significantly affect the OEM and thus such requirements
would not be subject to subsection 209(e)(2). In this second scenario, the modest retrofit requirements would still
be subject to challenge in court under the

(

i.e,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 as of the date title passed, regardless of when the engine was produced, then an engine manufactured in 1990 but not
sold until 1994 would be subject to 1994 emission standards. This problem is avoided since California's Utility Engine
Rule ties the date of manufacture to the standard, therefore a 1990 engine would be subject to a 1990 standard and a 1994
engine subject to a 1994 standard.

Therefore, the Agency has determined that nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles will be ``new'' for purposes of the
Act until the equitable or legal title passes to the ultimate purchaser, or if title passage does not occur, then the
engine or vehicle will be new until placed into service.

V. Definition of Locomotive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The September 6, 1991 NPRM to the California nonroad preemption regulation defined locomotive as a self-propelled
piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized
maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment or carrying freight or
passenger traffic or both. As with the definition of ``new,'' EPA did not propose a definition of locomotive in its
May 17th NPRM, but is finalizing a definition is this rulemaking, relying in part on the definition proposed in the
September 6, 1991 NPRM and the comments received in response to that NPRM. The

EMA noted a difference between the NPRM definition and the definition given in the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA)
upon which the EPA definition was based, but did not recommend EPA use the LIA definition in the definition EMA provided.
The only difference between the EPA definition and the LIA definition is that the LIA definition of locomotive includes
a piece of equipment without propelling motors but with one or more control stands. This item was not included by EPA
since if it has no propelling motors it will not be of concern for purposes of engine emissions regulations. It is noted
that neither the Association of American Railroads (AAR) nor any railroad companies that commented on the NPRM, such
as Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, had any specific comments on the definition of locomotive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EMA provided definitions for ``locomotive'' and ``locomotive engine''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under this definition, the regulation of any engine mounted on a locomotive (such as an engine driving a crane or winch)
would be preempted. The dictionary definition of ``locomotive'' is a ``self-propelled vehicle, usually diesel
or electric, that travels on rails and moves railroad cars.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EMA's definition of locomotive engine goes beyond the specific purpose of locomotion to include any other engine
that might be placed on a locomotive. EPA believes that the term ``locomotive engine'' is limited to the engine used
to propel the locomotive and other railroad cars. However, EPA does believe that the term ``engines used in locomotives,''
as found in section 209(e)(1)(B), can be defined to include other engines which are mounted on a locomotive regardless
of whether they are used for purposes of self-propulsion. EPA notes that under this definitional framework the ``locomotive''
is only that piece of on-track equipment which is self-propelling and is designed for moving other cars containing
equipment, freight, or passengers. ``Engines used in locomotives'' thus includes an engine placed in the locomotive
to propel the train and also includes other engines mounted on the locomotive for auxiliary power generation for the
train, but does not include engines mounted on the train elsewhere than the locomotive. An engine providing power
for a crane or winch, for example, would only be considered preempted from state regulation (if it otherwise met the
requirements for ``new'') as ``an engine used in [a] locomotive'' if such engine were mounted on the locomotive. EPA
believes these definitions reflect the intent of Congress to reduce the burden on interstate commerce for the railroad
industry, and address EMA's concerns regarding auxiliary engines.

EPA has stricken the word ``carrying'' from the definition of locomotive. This was done to avoid implying that any
persons or property that were moved by the engine had to be located directly on the locomotive. The word ``moving''
in the definition is all that is needed to give the correct meaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the final rule, EPA has decided that a ``locomotive'' means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other
than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other
similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment, freight or passenger traffic. EPA has also decided that
the term ``engines used in locomotives'' means either an engine placed in the locomotive to move other equipment,
freight , or passenger traffic, or an engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power.

VII. Cost Analysis

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has adjusted its estimate of the average annual cost of this rule upward from approximately $29 million to $70 million.
EPA has decided to make the adjustment after analyzing new information provided by commenters with respect to the
engine modifications required to meet the adopted emission standards and updated cost information provided confidentially
by manufacturers. Based on EPA's revised analysis (see the final version of the Regulatory Support Document in the
docket), the Agency has adjusted the present value of the per engine increase in retail price of a 1996 model year engine
upward from approximately $110 per engine to approximately $220 per engine (in 1992 dollars).

To maintain acceptable performance throughout the engine speed band, some manufacturers commented that they will
choose to use waste-gate technology in lieu of smoke limiters on some of their engine models. These manufacturers
stated that, for their engine designs, applying a smoke limiter to control smoke could cause a performance discontinuity
that could present a safety concern under certain operating conditions. While the cost of waste-gate technology
was not accounted for in EPA's proposed cost impact, the Agency believes it is reasonable for manufacturers to use
a costlier solution in those cases where there is a potential performance or safety impact. EPA estimates that half
of the turbocharged engines could be fitted with this technology. That represents approximately 30 percent of all
engines covered by this rule with a parallel 30 percent reduction in use of smoke limiter technology. Based on average
per piece cost figures submitted by manufacturers, EPA has calculated that the addition of waste-gate technology
in the technology mix would result in a per engine weighted hardware cost increase of approximately $35 per engine,
while the weighted cost due to use of smoke limiter technology will be revised to $3 per engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also assumed in its estimate of hardware cost that there would be little or no cost involved with upgrading fuel
pumps to increased injection pressures (as opposed to changing pump type, rotary to in-line, in-line to unit injector).
During the comment period, manufacturers provided concrete evidence that there is a significant cost increment
to increasing injection pressures. Based on manufacturers' data an average weighted cost of $73 per engine will be
assessed to account for modifications that will allow in-line fuel pumps and unit fuel injection systems to accommodate
incremental increases in injection pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers also provided information on additional hardware costs. Electronic control systems and low sac fuel
injectors were two strategies mentioned. While electronic control will reduce NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission, EPA maintains that is not the most cost effective method to meet the requirements of this rule. A number of
marketing and performance reasons unrelated to emission performance, such as fuel economy and versatility, make
such strategies attractive to manufacturers. These reasons in and of themselves may cause manufacturers to convert
a portion of their fleets to electronic controls. Because EPA's cost estimate is based on the necessary cost to meet
this rule and to maintain current performance and fuel economy characteristics, the extra cost incurred by a manufacturer
to install electronic control will not be added to EPA cost estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, manufacturers requested that EPA include the cost of low sac injectors. Low sac injectors are an effective
HC control strategy. However, EPA's proposal did not contain HC standards, and the HC standard adopted in the final
rule can be expected to do no better than cap the current HC levels. Furthermore, EPA requested that manufacturers
provide information on the cost ramifications of adopting additional standards. Industry comments have stated
that EPA's adoption of the HC standard will not increase the cost of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it has adequately accounted for costs of low sac injectors in its fuel system cost estimates and will not
report a separate cost line to account for the limited usage of low sac injectors caused by this rulemaking. A percentage
of the engine production volume by the 1996 model year will be using low sac injectors whether regulations are in place
or not. An additional percentage of regulated engines that undergo fuel system modifications will incorporate low
sac injectors at that time. Manufacturers that intend to do this have reported fuel system modification costs that
include the low sac injector costs. These costs are already included in the EPA hardware cost estimate under the ``Fuel
System Improvements'' section of the RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several manufacturers suggested that their engine model prices would increase more than the proposed EPA per engine
retail price increase. It should be noted that the EPA present value per engine retail price estimate is a relative
estimate aggregated across engines on a sales-weighted basis. Thus the estimate cannot be directly translated into
the price increase a consumer should expect to pay for a particular piece of equipment. For engines greater than 130
kW, the disaggregated data generally indicate that an engine purchaser can expect a price increase of approximately
$100 per 75 kW, which represents less than one percent of the equipment price in most cases. Price increases for engines
between 37 kW and 130 kW will generally increase between zero to two percent of the equipment price. These are general
estimates and there will be exceptions that do not show in EPA's reported aggregate value. In any event, relative industry
level estimates calculated for regulatory analysis purposes would not be expected to match the retail price of a particular
engine design. However, based on all data available (including confidential manufacturers' submissions), EPA
believes that its final adjusted estimate reported in the rulemaking is accurate in the aggregate and is consistent
with accepted regulatory costing methodology.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some comments suggested that the proposed rule would cause a significant increase in fuel consumption. EPA maintains
that the impact of this rule on fleet average fuel consumption will be minimal. EPA's experience with on-highway engines
is that fuel consumption decreases when the various technologies to control emissions are added. From 1988 to 1991,
fuel consumption decreased one percent, while NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoke decreased about 40 percent for the average on-highway engine. Specific power also increased four percent.
EPA's on-highway findings are consistent with an analysis presented by Caterpillar at the American Petroleum Institute
Off-Highway Forum in September, 1993 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (see the RSD for details of this analysis). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's estimate of hardware costs accounts for those additional costs needed to control fuel consumption beyond what
is necessary to reduce NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 emission levels to meet the standard. These methods to both reduce NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions and maintain current fuel consumption and performance have been used for a number of years in the on-highway
fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since fuel economy and power are important criteria for the consumers of these engines, most manufacturers commented
that they are going to add hardware to their engines in an effort to maintain current levels of performance. Some manufacturers
commented that while they would do their best to fully maintain the baseline fuel economy levels, selected engine
models would incur a small fuel economy penalty despite their efforts. While a small number of engine families may
not be capable, for either technical or cost reasons, to fully retain current fuel consumption and power levels, EPA's
past experience with the on-highway program has shown that most engine models will be able to attain the emission standards
without compromising fuel consumption or power. One manufacturer stated that it expected fuel efficiency to increase
over time as manufacturers optimize their engine designs. EPA has strong evidence from its historical database suggesting
that is the case.

EPA maintains that the impact of this rule on equipment in which regulated engines are installed will be minimal. EPA
has accounted for the cost of applying the range of engine technologies required to maintain engine efficiency so
that equipment modifications will not be required. Furthermore, the added program flexibilities, such as the later
implementation date for lower power engines and the implementation of the ABT program, provide means for manufacturers
to minimize any negative impacts. Based on EPA's analysis in the RSD and further discussed in the Response to Comments
document in the docket, EPA believes that the adopted rules provide the means to avoid equipment modifications in
all but the most severe cases. These cases will not affect the aggregate cost analysis presented in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received with respect to equipment impacts centered around the need to redesign the engine cooling system
and increase maintenance to offset an expected loss in engine efficiency. A number of commenters disagreed with EPA's
assessment of no impact on equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA provided analysis in the draft RSD supporting minimal loss in engine efficiency. Manufacturers did not provide
data demonstrating efficiency losses and did not refute the data provided by EPA. Four equipment manufacturers and
their association did provide average cost figures. These cost figures were based on anticipated equipment modifications
and increased maintenance due to engine efficiency loss estimates that were not supported with data. Furthermore,
projections and costs for equipment modification and maintenance were highly aggregated and thus provided insufficient
resolution to establish the need for the projected equipment changes. Requests from EPA for additional data from
specific manufacturers were not responded to with sufficient detail. Based on the information available to EPA (and
discussed further in the Response to Comments in the docket), the Agency concludes that equipment modifications
will rarely be needed to accommodate certified engines.

IX. Cost Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating various pollution control options, EPA considers the cost effectiveness of the control. The cost effectiveness
of a pollution control measure is typically expressed as the cost per ton of pollutant emissions reduced. Other things
being equal, Agency guidance directs that the regulatory option selected should, for a given level of effectiveness,
cost less per ton of emissions reduced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it may adversely affect in a material way that sector of the economy involved with the production
of nonroad large CI engines and nonroad vehicles and equipment using those engines, previously unregulated by EPA.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record.

C. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of
these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. This
regulation will affect manufacturers of large nonroad CI engines, a group that does not contain a substantial number
of small entities. Manufacturers will be able to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by the averaging, banking,
and trading program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, I certify that this regulation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time
period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual
operating period of the seasonal source. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis (i.e., at least two years)
and that operates at that single location approximately three months (or more) each year. This paragraph does not
apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.

Section numbering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Sections are numbered sequentially by subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Where two different standards or requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrently applicable, the model year of applicability is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by the number following the main section number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two digits following the hyphen designate the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year for which a section is effective.

Example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 89.304&hyph;96 applies to the 1996 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent model years until superseded. If a &sect;89.304&hyph;98 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is promulgated, it would take effect beginning with the 1998 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year; &sect;89.304&hyph;96 would apply to model years 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 1997. Therefore, in calendar year 1997, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer may be certifying both 1997 and 1998 model year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, requiring the use of different requirements

concurrently.

 Model year 2000 and later will appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequentially with 1999 and earlier based on the order of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last two digits of the year, not in calendar year order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, &sect;89.304&hyph;03 will appear before &sect;89.304&hyph;99.

Appendix A to Subpart A_Internal Combustion Engines Manufactured Prior to July 18, 1994
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix sets forth the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) interpretation of the Clean Air Act regarding
the status of certain internal combustion engines manufactured before July 18, 1994, (the effective date of the final
rulemaking promulgating EPA's definition of nonroad engine). This interpretation does not alter, replace, supersede,
or change the scope of subpart A. It is not final agency action subject to judicial review.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. EPA interprets the Clean Air Act as not precluding state regulation of internal combustion engines manufactured
prior to July 18, 1994, except that state regulation of such engines that are used in motor vehicles or vehicles used
solely for competition is precluded. EPA believes that the language of Clean Air Act section 302(z) generally excluding
emissions resulting directly from nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles from the definition of stationary source
could not be applied until after the definition of nonroad engine was specified in final regulations promulgated
by EPA. EPA believes that if the exclusionary language of section 302(z) were applied before EPA's definition of nonroad
engine became final, states would have been frustrated from regulating internal combustion engines manufactured
during that time, given the uncertain nature of the definition of such engines. EPA believes that Congress did not
intend states to be prevented from regulating these engines before a final EPA definition was promulgated. EPA does
not believe that Congress intended the exclusionary language of section 302(z) regarding nonroad engines and vehicles
to be applied retroactively to engines, vehicles, and equipment regulated pursuant to a permit issued before the
date that the terms nonroad engine and nonroad vehicle were defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA further believes that internal combustion engines manufactured prior to July 18, 1994 are not preempted, under
Clean Air Act section 209, from state regulation. The two sections of the Act preempting state regulation of nonroad
engines, section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a) (as incorporated by section 213(d)), refer to ``nonroad engines subject
to regulation under this Act'' or to engines ``subject to this part'' (i.e., part A of title II of the Act). EPA believes
that, until EPA promulgated final regulations defining nonroad engines and subjecting such engines to regulation,
these engines were not preempted from state regulation under the Act, as the engines were not yet defined as nonroad
engines, nor were they subject to any regulation under title II of the Act. In the regulations with an effective date
of July 18, 1994, EPA has issued final rules defining nonroad engines and, thus, subjecting nonroad engines to regulation
under part A of title II of the Act. Accordingly, EPA believes that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 209, state regulation
of new nonroad engines is preempted for engines manufactured on or after that date, and is not preempted as to engines
manufactured before that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Moreover, EPA believes that states are not precluded under section 209 from regulating the use and operation of
nonroad engines, such as regulations on hours of usage, daily mass emission limits, or sulfur limits on fuel; nor are
permits regulating such operations precluded once the engine is placed into service or once the equitable or legal
title to the engine or vehicle is transferred to an ultimate purchaser, as long as no certification, inspection, or
other approval related to the control on emissions is required as a condition precedent to the initial retail sale,
titling, or registration of the engine or equipment. EPA believes that states are not prevented by section 209 from
requiring retrofitting of nonroad engines in certain circumstances once a reasonable time has passed after the engine
is no longer new, as long as the requirements do not amount to a standard relating back to the original manufacturer.
Therefore, EPA believes that modest retrofit requirements may be required after a reasonable amount of time (e.g.,
at the time of reregistration or rebuilding) and more significant retrofit requirements may be required after a more
significant period of time (e.g., after the end of the useful life of the engine).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Each test engine must be configured to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of actual in-use operation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may specify the adjustment of any adjustable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter. All test results must be reported to the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Confirmatory testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct confirmatory testing or other testing on any test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. The manufacturer must deliver test engines as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by the Administrator. When the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducts confirmatory testing or other testing, those test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results are used to determine compliance with emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of carryover test data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In lieu of testing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify an engine family for a given model year, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer may submit, with the Administrator's approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission test data used to certify that engine family in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous years. This ``carryover'' data is only allowable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submitted test data show that the test engine would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the emission standard(s) for the model year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which certification is being sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either Table 4 or Table 5 of appendix A to subpart D of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part in confirmatory testing or other testing on any test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. Emission test results based on use of Table 5 fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be used to confirm compliance with HC, CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel will be used to confirm compliance with HC, CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke standards; when a manufacturer uses the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in Table 4 of appendix A to subpart D of this part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for its certification testing, EPA has the option to use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM emission result, corrected using the PM correction factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in &sect;89.425&hyph;96, to confirm compliance with the PM

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If all test engines representing an engine family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have emissions less than or equal to each emission standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that family complies with the emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If any test engine representing an engine family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has emissions greater than each emission standard, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family will be deemed not in compliance with the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If aftertreatment is employed by an engine family, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then a deterioration factor must be determined and applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For engine families included in the averaging, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Any facility where any document, design, or procedure relating to the translation of the design and construction
of engines and emission-related components described in the application for certification or used for certification
testing into production engines is located or carried on; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any facility where any engines to be introduced into commerce are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured or assembled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) On admission to any such facility referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, any EPA enforcement officer or EPA
authorized representative shall be allowed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or assembly and other procedures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or designs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such new engines and any component used in the assembly thereof
that are reasonably related to the purpose of his or her entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative shall be furnished by those in charge of a facility
being inspected with such reasonable assistance as he or she may request to help the enforcement officer or authorized
representative discharge any function listed in this paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of certification
is required to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without
charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services;
the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform
the EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative of how the facility operates and to answer the officer's
questions; and the performance on request of emission tests on any engine which is being, has been, or will be used for
certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate service accumulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A manufacturer may be compelled to cause any employee at a facility being inspected to appear before an EPA enforcement
officer or EPA authorized representative. The request for the employee's appearance shall be in writing, signed
by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, and served on the manufacturer. Any employee who has been instructed
by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative applies
whether or not the applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign manufacturers
and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However,
if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to ensure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed
judgment that an engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility
of the manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will
not arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Any entry without 24 hours prior written or oral notification to the affected manufacturer shall be authorized
in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement.

Averaging 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for nonroad engines means the exchange of emission credits among engine families within a given manufacturer's product
line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Banking 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the retention of nonroad engine emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use
in future model year averaging or trading as permitted by these regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission credits 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
represent the amount of emission reduction or exceedance, by a nonroad engine family, below or above the emission
standard, respectively. Emission reductions below the standard are considered as ``positive credits,'' while
emission exceedances above the standard are considered as ``negative credits.'' In addition, ``projected credits''
refer to emission credits based on the projected applicable production/sales volume of the engine family. ``Reserved
credits'' are emission credits generated within a model year waiting to be reported to EPA at the end of the model year.
``Actual credits'' refer to emission credits based on actual applicable production/sales volume as contained in
the end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or all of these credits may be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year
reports or any subsequent audit action(s) uncovers problems or errors.

Dynamometer calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If necessary, follow the dynamometer manufacturer's instructions for initial start-up and basic operating
adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Check the dynamometer torque measurement for each range used by the following method: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Warm up the dynamometer following the dynamometer manufacturer's specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine the dynamometer calibration moment arm (a distance/weight measurement). Dynamometer manufacturer's
data, actual measurement, or the value recorded from the previous calibration used for this subpart may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When calibrating the engine flywheel torque transducer, any lever arm used to convert a weight or a force through
a distance into a torque must be in a horizontal position (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 degrees). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Calculate the indicated torque (IT) for each calibration weight to be used by: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
IT = calibration weight (N) &times; calibration moment arm (m) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Attach each calibration weight specified in &sect;89.306&hyph;96 to the moment arm at the calibration distance
determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Record the power measurement equipment response (N^m) to each weight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For each calibration weight, compare the torque value measured in paragraph (b)(5) of this section to the calculated
torque determined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The measured torque must be within 2 percent of the calculated torque. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If the measured torque is not within 2 percent of the calculated torque, adjust or repair the system. Repeat steps
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section with the adjusted or repaired system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Optional. A master load-cell or transfer standard may be used to verify the torque measurement system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The master load-cell and read out system must be calibrated with weights at each test weight specified in &sect;89.306&hyph;96.
The calibration weights must be traceable to within 0.1 percent of applicable national standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Warm up the dynamometer following the equipment manufacturer's specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Load the dynamometer to a minimum of 6 equally spaced torque values as indicated by the master load-cell for each
in-use range used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The in-use torque measurement must be within 2 percent of the torque measured by the master system for each load
used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the in-use torque is not within 2 percent of the master torque, adjust or repair the system. Repeat steps in paragraphs
(c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section with the adjusted or repaired system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Calibrated resistors may not be used for engine flywheel torque transducer calibration, but may be used to span
the transducer prior to engine testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Perform other engine dynamometer system calibrations as dictated by good engineering practice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) For each component (pump, sample line section, filters, and so forth) in the heated portion of the sampling system
that has a separate source of power or heating element, use engineering judgment to locate the coolest portion of that
component and monitor the temperature at that location. If several components are within an oven, then only the surface
temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and the oven temperature need be measured.

Emission measurement accuracy_Bagged sampling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer readings below 15 percent of full-scale
chart deflection should generally not be used. (2) Some high resolution read-out systems, such as computers, data
loggers, and so forth, can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems
may be used provided that additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curves. If a gas
divider is used, the gas divider must conform to the accuracy requirements specified in &sect;89.312&hyph;96(c).
The following procedure for calibration below 15 percent of full scale may be used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Span the full analyzer range using a top range calibration gas meeting the accuracy requirements of &sect;89.312&hyph;96(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Generate a calibration curve according to, and meeting the requirements of, &sect;&sect;89.319&hyph;96 through
89.323&hyph;96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Select a calibration gas (a span gas may be used for calibrating the CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 analyzer) with a concentration midway between the two lowest calibration gases or non-zero gas divider increments.
This gas must be ``named'' to an accuracy of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2.0 percent of NIST gas standards, or other standards approved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section,
check the concentration of the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The concentration derived
from the curve must be within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected
in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the calibration points. Fit a calibration
curve per &sect;&sect;89.319&hyph;96 through 89.322&hyph;96 of this chapter for the entire analyzer range.

 Analyzers used for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured concentration falls between 15 and
100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. Exceptions to these limits are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent or more than 100 percent of full scale if automatic range change
circuitry is used and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full scale if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Alternative (c)(2) of this section is used to ensure that the accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below
15 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

adjustment can indicate a need for instrument maintenance.): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The calibration is checked by using a zero gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a span gas whose nominal value is between 80 percent and 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of full-scale, inclusive, of the measuring range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After the emission test a zero gas and the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
span gas will be used for rechecking. The analysis will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered acceptable if the difference between the two

(a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being analyzed can interfere with the reading in several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways. Positive interference occurs in NDIR and PMD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments when the interfering gas gives the same effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas broadening the absorption band of the measured gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CLD instruments by the interfering gas quenching the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to introduction into service and at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually thereafter, adjust the FID hydrocarbon analyzer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optimum hydrocarbon response as specified in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Follow good engineering practices for initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument start-up and basic operating adjustment using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate fuel (see &sect;89.312&hyph;96(e)) and zero-grade air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One of the following procedures is required for FID 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or HFID optimization: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The procedure outlined in Society of Automotive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineers (SAE) paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of a Flame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ionization Detector for Determination of Hydrocarbon in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diluted Automotive Exhausts''; author, Glenn D. Reschke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86.331&hyph;79 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record them for future reference.

Initial and periodic calibration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the FID or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be calibrated on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally used instrument ranges using the steps in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph. Use the same flow rate and pressures as when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzing samples. Calibration gases shall be introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly at the analyzer, unless the ``overflow'' calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of &sect;86.1310&hyph;90(b)(3)(i) of this chapter for the HFID 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Calibrate on each used operating range with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propane-in-air (dilute) or propane-in-nitrogen (raw) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration gases having nominal concentrations starting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 10&hyph;15 percent and increasing in at least six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental steps to 90 percent of that range. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental steps are to be spaced to represent good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering practice. For each range calibrated, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or less of the value at each data point, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration values may be calculated by use of a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which represents the data to within 2 percent of each test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point shall be used to determine concentration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calibration curve. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Develop a calibration curve for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each range used as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Zero the analyzer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Span the analyzer to give a response of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 90 percent of full-scale chart deflection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 0.5 percent of full scale, repeat the steps given in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Record the response of calibration gases having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal concentrations starting between 10 and 15 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and increasing in at least six incremental steps to 90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of that range. The incremental steps are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spaced to represent good engineering practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Generate a calibration curve. The calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curve shall be of fourth order or less, have five or fewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients. If any range is within 2 percent of being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linear a linear calibration may be used. Include zero as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data point. Compensation for known impurities in the zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas can be made to the zero-data point. The calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curve must fit the data points within 2 percent of point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Optional. A new calibration curve need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A calibration curve conforming to paragraph (b)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section exists; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The responses generated in paragraph (b)(4) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section are within 1 percent of full scale or 2 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of point, whichever is less, of the responses predicted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calibration curve for the gases used in paragraph (b)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If multiple range analyzers are used, the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range used must meet the curve fit requirements below 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of full scale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on
an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant,
exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour
(g/kW-hr).

Test procedure overview. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer.
The exhaust gases, generated raw or dilute during engine operation, are sampled for specific component analysis
through the analytical train. The test is applicable to engines equipped with catalytic or direct-flame afterburners,
induction system modifications, or other systems, or to uncontrolled engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides
of nitrogen. The test consists of one idle mode, four power modes at one speed and three power modes at another speed.
These procedures require the determination of the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow,
and the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each pollutant
emitted per kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) (1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions, the complete engine shall be tested with all emission control
devices installed and functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, or air compressors) may be installed but such
accessory loading will be considered parasitic in nature and observed power shall be used in the emission calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the application must be functioning during all procedures
in this subpart. In cases of component malfunction or failure, maintenance to correct component failure or malfunction
must be authorized in accordance with &sect;86.094&hyph;25 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The engine must be equipped with an electrical generation device typical of one used in customer service (such
as an alternator). The power drain from it must be no greater than what is sufficient to operate the engine on the test
stand.

(c) If during the test, the filter element(s) were replaced or cleaned, a vacuum check must be performed per &sect;89.316&hyph;96(a)
immediately after the span checks. If the vacuum side leak check does not meet the requirements of &sect;89.316&hyph;96(a),
the test is void.

Automatic data collection equipment requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, and
so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the following is required: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For bag sample analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for
the dilute exhaust sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized
period shall be stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For continuous analysis systems, a single value representing the average integrated concentration over a cycle
shall be stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this
section may be stored on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage discs, punch cards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and so forth, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records
from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC equipment is subject to the calibration specifications
of the analyzer as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be stored as chart recorder records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bag sample analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For bag sample analysis perform the following sequence: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and
so forth, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obtain a stable zero reading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Zero and span the analyzers with zero and span gases. The span gases must have concentrations between 75 and 100
percent of full-scale chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures during spanning shall be approximately
the same as those encountered during sampling. A sample bag may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to identify the required analyzer range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Recheck zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (c)(3) of this
section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section must be repeated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Measure HC, CO, CO

(c)(3) of this section. (Constituents measured continuously do not require bag analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) A post-analysis zero and span check of each range must be performed and the values recorded. The number of events
that may occur between the pre- and post-analysis checks is not specified. However, the difference between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section) versus those recorded
for the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span drift limit of 2 percent of full-scale chart

 For continuous sample analysis perform the following sequence: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and
so forth, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated
sample lines, filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Optional: Perform a hangup check for the HFID sampling system: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. The HFID analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned
through the overflow sampling system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (d)(5) of this
section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section must be repeated.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Schematic drawing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An example of a sampling and analytical system which may be used for testing under this subpart is shown in Figure 1 in
appendix B to subpart D. All components or parts of components that are wetted by the sample or corrosive calibration
gases shall be either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemically cleaned stainless steel or inert material, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene resin. The use of ``gauge
savers'' or ``protectors'' with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sample probe.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The sample probe shall be a straight, closed-end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The inside diameter shall
not be greater than the inside diameter of the sample line plus 0.03 cm. The wall thickness of the probe shall not be greater
than 0.10 cm. The fitting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attaches the probe to the exhaust pipe shall be as small as practical in order to minimize heat loss from the probe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The probe shall have a minimum of three holes. The spacing of the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such
that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. See Figure 1 in appendix A to this subpart.
The angular spacing of the holes must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one plane may not be 180
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; (that is, section view C-C of Figure 1 in appendix A to this subpart). The holes should be sized such that each has
approximately the same flow. If only three holes are used, they may not all be in the same radial plane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The probe shall extend radially across the exhaust duct. The probe must pass through the approximate center and
must extend across at least 80 percent of the diameter of the duct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The maximum inside diameter of the sample line shall not exceed 1.32 cm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is used, the sample probe must connect directly to valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The location of optional valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may not be greater than 1.22 m from the exhaust duct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The location of optional valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may not be greater than 61 cm from the sample pump. The leakage rate for this section on the pressure side of the sample
pump may not exceed the leakage rate specification for the vacuum side of the pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Venting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All vents, including analyzer vents, bypass flow, and pressure relief vents of regulators, should be vented in such
a manner to avoid endangering personnel in the immediate area.

(e) Any variation from the specifications in this subpart including performance specifications and emission detection
methods may be used only with prior approval by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Additional components, such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, switches, and so forth, may be employed
to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system used for raw testing under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The sample for all components shall be taken with one sample probe, except as allowed under &sect;89.413&hyph;96,
and internally split to the different analyzers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Raw sampling procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Follow these procedures when sampling for gaseous emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The gaseous emission sampling probe must be installed at least 0.5 m or 3 times the diameter of the exhaust pipe_whichever
is the larger_upstream of the exit of the exhaust gas system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of a multi-cylinder engine with a branched exhaust manifold, the inlet of the probe shall be located
sufficiently far downstream so as to ensure that the sample is representative of the average exhaust emissions from
all cylinders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In multi-cylinder engines having distinct groups of manifolds, such as in a ``Vee'' engine configuration, it
is permissible to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sample after all exhaust pipes have been connected together into a single exhaust pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each mode, sample from each exhaust pipe and average the gaseous concentrations to determine a value for each
mode. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sample from all exhaust pipes simultaneously with the sample lines connected to a common manifold prior to the
analyzer. It must be demonstrated that the flow rate through each individual sample line is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4 percent of the average flow rate through all the sample lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Use another method, if it has been approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All heated sampling lines shall be fitted with a heated filter to extract solid particles from the flow of gas required
for analysis. The sample line for CO, CO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the composition of the exhaust gas is influenced by any treatment such as heat exchanger or air injection (except
catalysts and soot filters) then the exhaust probe must be taken upstream of this device.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The air flow measurement method used must have a range large enough to accurately measure the air flow over the engine
operating range during the test. Overall measurement accuracy must be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 percent or less of the reading. The Administrator must be advised of the method used prior to testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When an engine system incorporates devices that affect the air flow measurement (such as air bleeds) that result
in understated exhaust emission results, corrections to the exhaust emission results shall be made to account for
such effects.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exhaust gas sampling system described in this section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions
in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled nonroad compression-ignition engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept
(described in &sect;86.1310&hyph;90 of this chapter) of measuring mass emissions of HC, CO, and CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 measurements. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test
period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement
of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. General requirements are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP&hyph;CVS and a heat exchanger or a CFV&hyph;CVS with either a heat
exchanger or electronic flow compensation. Figure 2 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the PDP&hyph;CVS
system. Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the CFV&hyph;CVS system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&cir;C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously
over the test cycle. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, the HFID must be used with a constant flow system
to ensure a representative sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The heated probe shall be located in the primary dilution tunnel and far enough downstream of the mixing chamber
to ensure a uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the point of sampling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The CO and CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The components necessary for exhaust sampling shall meet the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exhaust dilution system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PDP&hyph;CVS shall conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP&hyph;CVS in &sect;86.1309&hyph;90(b)
of this chapter. The CFV&hyph;CVS shall conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas CFV&hyph;CVS
in &sect;86.1309&hyph;90(c) of this chapter. In addition, the CVS must conform to the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream at or below the temperature
required for the measurement of hydrocarbon emissions noted in the following paragraph and to prevent condensation
of water at any point in the dilution tunnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the primary dilution
tunnel at a temperature of 191 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement and as required to prevent condensation at any point
in the dilution tunnel. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this sampling point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the CFV&hyph;CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation is required (see Figure 3 in appendix
A to this subpart).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For the CFV&hyph;CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately
ahead of the critical flow venturi, shall be within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) of the average operating temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement that condensation
does not occur. The temperature measuring system (sensors and readout) shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining
constant temperature is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The primary dilution air shall have a temperature of 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

Continuous HC measurement system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The continuous HC sample system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in appendix A to this subpart) uses an ``overflow'' zero
and span system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills out of the probe when zero and span checks of the
analyzer are made. The ``overflow'' system may also be used to calibrate the HC analyzer per &sect;86.1321&hyph;90(b)
of this chapter, although this is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample
pump is used for all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good engineering practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line shall be at least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close as practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct
or dilution tunnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The continuous HC sampling system shall consist of a probe (which must raise the sample to the specified temperature)
and, where used, a sample transfer system (which must maintain the specified temperature). The continuous hydrocarbon
sampling system (exclusive of the probe) shall:

accurate results, exact conformance with the drawing is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. Additional components such as instruments, valves,

solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information and coordinate the functions of the

component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical system shall conform to the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. Other types of analyzers may be used if shown to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the

Administrator.

Dilute sampling procedures_CVS calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictor valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to NIST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements, and will serve as the reference value (NIST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``true'' value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should an upstream screen or other restriction which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the flow be used ahead of the flowmeter unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrated throughout the flow range with such a device.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a ``metering venturi'' type flowmeter. Large radius or ASME 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow nozzles are considered equivalent if traceable to NIST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traceable to NIST measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded and related to flow through the CVS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Procedures used by EPA for both PDP&hyph;CVS and CFV&hyph;CVS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results may be used if approved in advance by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of the entire system may be performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of the system (for example, analyzer calibration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks, or HC hangup). A verification procedure is found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) All the parameters related to the pump are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The calculated flow rate, in
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(cm3/s), (at pump inlet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a correlation function which is the value of a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of pump parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the correlation function is then determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a calibration for each range used must be performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) This calibration procedure is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the calibration curve: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The temperature stability must be maintained during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration. (Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oscillations; this can cause the data points to be scattered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gradual changes in temperature are acceptable as long as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur over a period of several minutes.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate from the calibration equation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in appendix A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this subpart. Although particular types of equipment are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) After the system has been connected as shown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 5 in appendix A to this subpart, set the variable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS pump for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 minutes. Record the calibration data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition in an increment of pump inlet depression that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data acquisition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

CVS system verification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following ``gravimetric'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments can accurately measure a mass of gas that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injected into the system. (Verification can also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by constant flow metering using critical flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orifice devices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99.5 percent or greater propane or carbon monoxide gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Caution_carbon monoxide is poisonous). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.01 grams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of pure propane into the system during the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (approximately 5 minutes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The calculations are performed in the normal way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kg/m3/carbon atom)) is used in place of the density of exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbons.

Test orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A test order addressed to the manufacturer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for any testing under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The test order is signed by the Assistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator for Air and Radiation or his or her designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test order must be delivered in person by an EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company representative or sent by registered mail, return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed the application for certification submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer, pursuant to the requirements of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of subpart B of this part. Upon receipt of a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order, the manufacturer must comply with all of the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this subpart and instructions in the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information included in test order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order will specify the engine family to be selected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated storage facility or port facility (for imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by which engines of the specified family must be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test order may specify the configuration to be audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers are required to select a minimum of four engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to &sect;89.507&hyph;96(a), or unless total production of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total production of the specified configuration is less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four engines per day, the manufacturer selects the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of engines produced per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The test order may include alternate families to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected for testing at the Administrator's discretion in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event that engines of the specified family are not available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for testing because those engines are not being manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the specified time or are not being stored at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
port of entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rate of at least two engines per day in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers specified in &sect;89.508&hyph;96(g)(1), or one engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.508&hyph;96(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Assistant Administrator or her or his designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative may select engines of the alternate family for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In addition, the test order may include other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions or information essential to the administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the corresponding assembly plants, associated storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, or (in the case of imported engines) port 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities from which the manufacturer prefers to have engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected for testing in response to a test order. In order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not issue to a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Auditing (SEA) test orders than an annual limit determined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the larger of the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Production factor, determined by dividing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected nonroad engine sales in the United States for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year, as declared by the manufacturer under &sect;89.505- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96(c)(1), by 16,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the projected sales are less than 8,000, this factor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Family factor, determined by dividing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's total number of certified engine families by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or during the model year a reliable sales projection update or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adds engine families or deletes engine families from its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, that information is used for recalculating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's annual limit of SEA test orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any SEA test order for which the family fails under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.510&hyph;96 or for which testing is not completed is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted against the annual limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may issue additional test orders to test those families for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which evidence exists indicating noncompliance. An SEA test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order issued on this basis will include a statement as to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason for its issuance.

&sect;89.503&hyph;96 that engines of a specified family be selected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a manner consistent with the requirements of &sect;89.507&hyph;96 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Administrator at the place designated for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of conducting emission tests. These tests will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in accordance with &sect;89.508&hyph;96 to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines manufactured by the manufacturer conform with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with respect to which the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity was issued.

Administrator conducts a test on a test engine or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator and manufacturer each conduct a test on the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test engine, the results of the Administrator's test comprise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the official data for that engine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test engine, the manufacturer's test data is accepted as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official data, provided that if the Administrator makes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination based on testing conducted under paragraph (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section that there is a substantial lack of agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the manufacturer's test results and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If testing conducted under &sect;89.503&hyph;96 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's determination that the test facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate for conducting the tests required by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart and the reasons therefor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer that the data acquired under &sect;89.503&hyph;96 was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous and the manufacturer's data was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator reconsider the determination in paragraph (b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section based on data or information which indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that changes have been made to the test facility and these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes have resolved the reasons for disqualification.

entry and access as authorized in this section, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. EPA enforcement officers or authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives may proceed ex parte to obtain a warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not the EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives first attempted to seek permission of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section only upon the consent of the recipient of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order or the party in charge of the facilities in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act for any person to refuse to permit an EPA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the location and in the manner specified in the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected in the manner specified in the test order, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the start of test sample selection, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator approves the procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The manufacturer must assemble the test engines of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the family selected for testing using its normal mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production process for engines to be distributed into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. If, between the time the manufacturer is notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change(s) in its production processes, including quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer must, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the test engines are selected at a location where they do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have their operational and emission control systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed, the test order will specify the manner and location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for selection of components to complete assembly of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. The manufacturer must assemble these components onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test engines using normal assembly and quality control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures as documented by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be used during the production and assembly of all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification in assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The order in which test engines are selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines the order in which test results are to be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying the sampling plan in accordance with &sect;89.510&hyph;96. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail decision is reached in accordance with &sect;89.510&hyph;96(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed the requirements as set forth in &sect;89.510&hyph;96(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.508&hyph;96(i).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine 8-mode test procedure as described in subpart E of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, the federal smoke test as described in part 86, subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I of this chapter, and the particulate test procedure as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted in the California Regulations for New 1996 and Later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference. See &sect;89.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any nonroad engine he or she determines is not susceptible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory testing using the procedures specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or modify the engines selected for testing and may not perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any emission tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification, and/or tests are documented in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with &sect;89.108&hyph;96, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any setting within the physically adjustable range of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;89.108&hyph;96, prior to the performance of any tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may not adjust it to any setting which causes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance characteristics and surveillance information from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar in-use engines.

Service Accumulation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to performing exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data engine corresponding to the family specified in the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of normal production engines. This service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation must be consistent with the new engine break-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions contained in the applicable owner's manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manufacturer must accumulate service at a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of 16 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise approved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The first 24-hour period for service begins as soon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed on each engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not apply on weekends or holidays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the minimum rate specified (16 hours per day), then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum daily accumulation rate is equal to the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Service accumulation must be completed on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient number of test engines during consecutive 24-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods to assure that the number of engines tested per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test engines after selection for testing, nor may the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator allow deletion of any engine from the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator before any engine maintenance or deletion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The manufacturer must expeditiously ship test engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of selection, the manufacturer must assure that test engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may approve more time for shipment based upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a test order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the Administrator within one working day of receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test order as to which test facility will be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the test order. If no test cells are available at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the United States market for the applicable year of 7,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two engines per 24-hour period, including each voided test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each smoke test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one engine per 24-hour period, including each voided test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each smoke test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission testing based upon a request by a manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanied by a satisfactory justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The manufacturer must perform test engine selection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping, preparation, service accumulation, and testing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Initial test results are calculated following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable test procedure specified in paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.508&hyph;96. The manufacturer rounds these results, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with ASTM E29&hyph;90, to the number of decimal places 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional significant figure. This procedure has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference. See &sect;89.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final test results are calculated by summing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each test engine, dividing by the number of tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted on the engine, and rounding in accordance with ASTM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E29&hyph;90 to the same number of decimal places contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable standard expressed to one additional significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within five working days after completion of testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A failed engine is one whose final test results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to &sect;89.509&hyph;96(b), for one or more of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants, exceed the applicable emission standard or family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The manufacturer must test engines comprising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test sample until a pass decision is reached for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants or a fail decision is reached for one pollutant. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutant is less than or equal to the pass decision number, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cumulative number of engines tested. A fail decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached when the cumulative number of failed engines for one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more pollutants is greater than or equal to the fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the cumulative number of engines tested.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cumulative number of engines tested are determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the tables in appendix A to this subpart, ``Sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plans for Selective Enforcement Auditing of Nonroad Engines,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the projected sales as made by the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its report to EPA under &sect;89.505&hyph;96(c)(1). In the tables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in appendix A to this subpart, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a pass or fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engines with final test results exceeding the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further for the purposes of the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made on the last engine required to make a decision under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to any engine failing pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.510&hyph;96 effective from the time that testing of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity for a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to paragraph &sect;89.510&hyph;96(c), based on the first test or all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests conducted on each engine. This suspension will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur before ten days after failure of the audit, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer requests an earlier suspension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the results of testing pursuant to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations indicate that engines of a particular family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with respect to which the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate of conformity with respect to that family for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application may be covered by a certificate of conformity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following infractions to be substantial: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of a test order issued by the Administrator under

&sect;89.503&hyph;96. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in any report or information provided to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative(s) is denied the opportunity to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative(s) is unable to conduct activities related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry and access as authorized in &sect;89.506&hyph;96 because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer has located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where local law prohibits those activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Administrator must notify the manufacturer in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of

effective upon receipt of the notification or ten days, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity for a family when the certificate has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in the application for certification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected family.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer
must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines,
describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance
measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which
the remedies will be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply
with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family, at the plant(s),
port facility(ies) or associated storage facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the
conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines
after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually determined to be in conformance
with the applicable standards or family emission levels through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures,
provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Once the certificate for a family has been revoked under paragraph (f) of this section and the manufacturer desires
to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before
the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for that modified family: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance
deterioration, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report
in paragraph (g) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart is sufficient to evaluate the proposed
change or changes or whether additional testing is required; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate
that the modified engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal
production runs of that modified engine family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order.
If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the Administrator will reissue the certificate or issue a
new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing
requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation remains in effect.
Any design change approvals under this subpart are limited to the family affected by the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification
of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph
(b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted
or any sampling methods have been properly applied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (d) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) will be in writing and will include the offer of an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with &sect;&sect;89.512&hyph;96,
89.513&hyph;96, and 89.514&hyph;96 and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) need not apply to engines no longer in the hands of the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section and prior to
the commencement of a hearing under &sect;89.512&hyph;96, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's
satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the
Administrator will reinstate the certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a
failure of an SEA and while reauditing of the failed family, it may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate
the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition that the
manufacturer consents to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally
reinstated if the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and to remedy any nonconformity at
no expense to the owner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision under &sect;89.511&hyph;96 (b), (c), (d),
or (f) to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to &sect;89.511&hyph;96
(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The manufacturer's request must be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's
notification of the decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer
must simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division
and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the
time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting
a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, at her or his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer
a hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The manufacturer's request for a public hearing must include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family is to be the subject of the hearing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing
requested under &sect;89.511&hyph;96(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted, specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with
applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied, specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in
Appendix A of this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants
other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision
under &sect;89.511&hyph;96(c);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues
raised; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available
to the public during Agency business hours.

(b) EPA will not require a U.S. Customs Service bond for a nonconforming nonroad engine which is imported under &sect;89.605&hyph;96
or &sect;89.609&hyph;96. The period of conditional admission may not exceed 120 days. Nonroad engines imported
under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96 may not be operated during the period of conditional admission
except for that operation necessary to comply with the requirements of this subpart. During the period of conditional
admission applicable to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, the importer must store the nonroad engine
at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) During the period of conditional admission under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, an ICI may
transfer responsibility of a nonroad engine to another qualified ICI for the purposes of complying with this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transferee ICI must be a holder of a currently valid certificate of conformity for the specific nonroad engine
being transferred or be authorized to import the nonroad engine pursuant to &sect;89.609&hyph;96 as of the transfer
date. The transferee ICI must comply with all the requirements of &sect;89.603&hyph;96, &sect;89.604&hyph;96,
and either &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the purpose of this subpart, the transferee ICI has ``imported'' the nonroad engine as of the transfer date
as designated in a written record that is signed by both ICIs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ICI that originally imported the nonroad engine is responsible for all requirements of this subpart from the
actual date of importation until the date of transfer as designated in the written record. The transferee ICI is responsible
for all requirements of this subpart beginning on the date of transfer.

(4) A copy of the written record is to be submitted to the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA within five working
days of the transfer date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart or U.S. Customs Service regulations, an ICI may also assume
responsibility for the modification and testing of a nonconforming nonroad engine which was previously imported
by another party. The ICI must be a holder of a currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid certificate of conformity for that specific nonroad engine or authorized to import it pursuant to &sect;89.609&hyph;96
at the time of assuming such responsibility. The ICI must comply with all the requirements of &sect;89.603&hyph;96,
&sect;89.604&hyph;96, and either &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, as applicable. For the purposes
of this subpart, the ICI has ``imported'' the nonroad engine as of the date the ICI assumes responsibility for the modification
and testing of the nonroad engine. The ICI must submit written notification to the Manufacturers Operations Division
of EPA within 10 working days of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption of that responsibility.

(a) A nonroad engine may be finally admitted into the United States upon approval of the ICI's application to the Administrator.
The application is made by completing EPA forms in accordance with EPA instructions. The application contains: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The information required in &sect;89.604&hyph;96(a); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Information demonstrating that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with a valid certificate of
conformity. Demonstration is made in one of the following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate
of conformity; presents to EPA a statement written by the applicable Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) that the
OEM must provide to the ICI, and to EPA, information concerning production changes to the class of nonroad engines
described in the ICI's application for certification; delivers to the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA
notification by the ICI of any production changes already implemented by the OEM at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and their effect on emissions; and obtains from EPA written approval to use this demonstration option;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate
of conformity. The ICI also attests that it has conducted, within 120 days of entry, an applicable and valid emission
test on every third nonroad engine imported under that certificate of conformity to demonstrate compliance with
federal emission requirements. The test is to be conducted at a laboratory located within the United States. Sequencing
of the tests is determined by the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importation of each nonroad engine beginning with the prototype nonroad engine used to obtain the applicable certificate
of conformity. Should the ICI exceed a threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity
without adjustments or other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of required
testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The results of every emission test which the ICI conducted on the nonroad engine pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)
of this section. Should a subject nonroad engine fail an emission test at any time, the following procedures are applicable:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ICI may either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Conduct one retest that involves no adjustment of the nonroad engine from the previous test (for example, adjusting
the RPM, timing, air-to-fuel ratio, and so forth) other than adjustments to adjustable parameters that, upon inspection,
were found to be out of tolerance. When such an allowable adjustment is made, the parameter may be reset only to the specified
(that is, nominal) value (and not any other value within the tolerance band); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Initiate a change in production (production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes
the nonroad engine to meet federal emission requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the ICI chooses to retest in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The retests are to be completed no later than five working days subsequent to the first emission test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Should the subject nonroad engine fail the second emission test, then the ICI must initiate a change in production
(a production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal
emission requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the ICI chooses to initiate a change in production (a production change) under the provisions of subpart B
of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal requirements, a change involving adjustments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustable nonroad engine parameters (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air/fuel ratio) represents a change
in the specified (that is, nominal) value to be deemed acceptable by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A production change made in accordance with this section is to be implemented on all subsequent nonroad engines
imported under the certificate of conformity after the date of importation of the nonroad engine which gave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rise to the production change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Commencing with the first nonroad engine receiving the production change, every third nonroad engine imported
under the certificate of conformity is to be emission tested to demonstrate compliance with federal emission requirements
until, as in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity is exceeded without adjustments or
other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, at which time the amount of required emission

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A report concerning these production changes is to be made to both the Manufacturers Operations and Certification
Divisions of EPA within ten working days of initiation of the production change. The cause of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of an emission test is to be identified, if known; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The applicable deterioration factor, if any; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The emission test results adjusted by the deterioration factor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Other information that may be specified by applicable regulations or on the certificate of conformity under which
the nonroad engine has been modified in order to assure compliance with requirements of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) All information required under &sect;89.610&hyph;96 related to maintenance, warranties, and labeling; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) An attestation by the ICI that the ICI is responsible for the nonroad engine's compliance with federal emission
requirements, regardless of whether the ICI owns the nonroad engine imported under this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The name, address, and telephone number of the person who the ICI prefers to receive EPA notification under &sect;89.605&hyph;96(c);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) An attestation by the ICI that all requirements of &sect;89.607&hyph;96 and &sect;89.610&hyph;96 have been
met; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is to be presumed not to have been granted
if a requirement of this subpart has not been met. This includes, but is not limited to, properly modifying the nonroad
engine to be in conformity in all material respects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the description in the application for certification or not complying with the provisions of &sect;89.605&hyph;96(a)(2)
or if the final emission test results, adjusted by the deterioration factor, if applicable, do not comply with applicable
emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under
this section is presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or written notice from EPA to the contrary
within 15 working days of the date that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the ICI's application
under paragraph (a) of this section. EPA notice of nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the responsibility
of the ICI to ensure that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the
date of receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's
inspection. The storage is to be within 50 miles of the ICI's testing facility to allow the Administrator reasonable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access for inspection and/or testing. A storage facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by
the Administrator prior to the submittal of the ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is presumed not to have been granted if any
requirement of this subpart has not been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under
this section is presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or written notice from EPA to the contrary
within 15 working days of the date that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the ICI's application
under paragraph (b) of this section. Such EPA notice of nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the responsibility
of the ICI to ensure that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the
date of receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is stored at a location where the Administrator
has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's inspection. The storage is to be within 50 miles
of the ICI's testing facility to allow the Administrator reasonable access for inspection and/or testing. A storage
facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by the Administrator prior to the submittal of the
ICI's application under paragraph (b) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to final admission, a nonroad engine imported under this section is subject to special inspections as described
in &sect;89.606&hyph;96 with these additional provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, a significant number of nonroad engines imported by an ICI fail to comply
with emission requirements upon inspection or retest or if the ICI fails to comply with a provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations that pertain to nonroad engines imported pursuant to &sect;89.609&hyph;96, the ICI may be placed
on the EPA list of ICIs ineligible to import nonroad engines under this section as specified in paragraph (e) of this
section and &sect;89.612&hyph;96(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An individual nonroad engine which fails a retest or inspection is to be repaired and retested, as applicable,
to demonstrate compliance with emission requirements before final admission is granted by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Unless otherwise specified by EPA, the ICI bears the costs of all retesting under this subsection, including transportation.

in &sect;89.104&hyph;96(b), in accordance with &sect;89.608&hyph;96(a). If, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the judgment of the Administrator, a significant number of properly maintained and used nonroad engines imported
by the ICI pursuant to this section fail to meet emission requirements, the name of the ICI may be placed on the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of ICIs ineligible to import nonroad engines under the modification/test provision as specified in paragraph

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission-related parts added by the ICI, and the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control and emission-related parts furnished by the Original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine Manufacturer (OEM). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The information required in this section to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to the ultimate purchaser or owner is to be copied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintained in a file containing the records for that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Warranties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) ICIs must submit to the Manufacturers Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Division of EPA sample copies (including revisions) of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranty documents required by this section prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing nonroad engines under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ICIs must provide to nonroad engine owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission warranties identical to those required by sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
207(a) of the Act. The warranty period for each nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is to commence on the date the nonroad engine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered by the ICI to the ultimate purchaser or owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ICIs must provide warranty insurance coverage by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepaid mandatory service insurance policy underwritten by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an independent insurance company. The policy is to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Be subject to the approval of the Administrator if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the insurance coverage is less than the required warranty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At a minimum, provide coverage for emission-related components installed or modified by the ICI and, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum extent possible, the emission-related components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed by the OEM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Be transferable to each successive owner for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods specified in &sect;89.104&hyph;96(c); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Provide that in the absence of an ICI's facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being reasonably available (that is, within 50 miles) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of warranty repairs, the warranty repairs may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed anywhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ICIs must attest in each application for final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission that the warranty requirements have been met, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mandatory insurance has been paid and is in effect, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that certificates and statements of the warranties have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or will be provided to the owner or ultimate purchaser. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copy of the warranties and evidence that the warranties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid and in effect is to be maintained in a file containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the records for each nonroad engine prior to submitting each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for final admission pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or &sect;89.609&hyph;96(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission labeling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For each nonroad engine imported pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, the ICI must affix
a permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legible label which identifies each nonroad engine and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The label meets all the requirements of &sect;89.110&hyph;96 and contains the following statement ``This nonroad
engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was originally produced in (month and year of original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production). It has been imported and modified by (ICI's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name, address, and telephone number) to conform to United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States emission regulations applicable to the (year) model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the nonroad engine is owned by the ICI at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of importation, the label also states ``This nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is warranted for five years or 3000 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation from the date of purchase, whichever first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the nonroad engine is not owned by the ICI at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of importation, the label states ``This nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is warranted for five years or 3000 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation from the date of release to the owner, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first occurs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For nonroad engines imported under &sect;89.609&hyph;96, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label clearly states in bold letters that ``This nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine has not been manufactured under a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity but conforms to United States emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations under a modification/test program.'' For all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engines imported pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.609&hyph;96, the label contains the vacuum hose routing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagram applicable to the nonroad engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As part of the application to the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for final admission of each individual nonroad engine under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.609&hyph;96, the ICI must maintain a copy of the labels for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each nonroad engine in a file containing the records for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that nonroad engine prior to submitting each application for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final admission. ICIs importing under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.609&hyph;96 must attest to compliance with the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling requirements of this section in each application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for final admission.

Exemptions and exclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Individuals, as well as ICIs, are eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing nonroad engines into the United States under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of this section, unless otherwise specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart, a nonroad engine entitled to one of the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions of this paragraph may be conditionally admitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the United States if prior written approval for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditional admission is to be under bond. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for approval from the Administrator is to contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification required in &sect;89.604&hyph;96(a) (except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.604&hyph;96(a)(5)) and information that demonstrates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the importer is entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the total amount of the bond or exportation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engine. The following temporary exemptions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted by this paragraph: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption for repairs or alterations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written approval by EPA, an owner of nonroad engines may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditionally import under bond such nonroad engines solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines may not be operated in the United States other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the sole purpose of repair or alteration. They may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be sold or leased in the United States and are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Testing exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A test nonroad engine may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditionally imported by a person subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;89.905. A test nonroad engine may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the United States provided that the operation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless a request is made by the appropriate importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the nonroad engine in accordance with &sect;89.905(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a subsequent one-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Precertification exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A prototype nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine for use in applying to EPA for certification pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this subpart may be conditionally imported subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable provisions of &sect;89.906 and the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No more than one prototype nonroad engine for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine family for which an importer is seeking certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be imported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The granting of precertification exemptions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator is discretionary. Normally, no more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three outstanding precertification exemptions are allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each importer. No precertification exemption is allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the importer requesting the exemption is in noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any requirement of this subpart until the noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Unless a certificate of conformity is issued for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototype nonroad engine and the nonroad engine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finally admitted pursuant to the requirements of &sect;89.605 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 180 days from the date of entry, the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bond is to be forfeited or the nonroad engine exported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless an extension is granted by the Administrator. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for an extension is to be in writing and received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator prior to the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precertification exemption expires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Such precertification nonroad engine may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the United States other than for the sole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the precertification exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Display exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A nonroad engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported subject to the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.907. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A display nonroad engine may be imported by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person for purposes related to a business or the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display of a nonroad engine at a dealership, private use, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other purpose that the Administrator determines is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for display exemptions. A display nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine may not be sold in the United States and may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the United States except for the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incident and necessary to the display purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A temporary display exemption is granted for 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is shorter. Two extensions of up to 12 months each are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available upon approval by the Administrator. In no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 36 months. The U.S. Customs Service bonds a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary display exemption.

Testing exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance
with this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant with the purpose of the test program and EPA's
monitoring requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each
of the four identified elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations,
studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item
of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated
purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under
&sect;89.1003. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the
cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable
number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An estimate of the program's duration, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test
and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The technical nature of the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The site of the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The time or mileage duration of the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The intended final disposition of the engines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use
in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required
by the Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish
the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the record-keeping
and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph
(a) of this section.

(d) It is a condition of any exemption for the purpose of export under paragraph (a) of this section, that such exemption
is void ab initio with respect to a new nonroad engine intended solely for export, where such nonroad engine is sold,
or offered for sale, to an ultimate purchaser or otherwise distributed or introduced into commerce in the United States
for purposes other than export.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to &sect;89.905 or &sect;89.908, EPA determines
it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared and submitted to the person
requesting the exemption. The memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and
conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements
by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records
accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption,
take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the
activity and the ultimate disposition of the engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the
extent that the specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term or condition causes the exemption
to be void ab initio with respect to any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act prohibited under
&sect;89.1003( a)(1) or (a)(3), other than in strict conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption,
renders the person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom the provisions of &sect;89.1003(a)
are applicable, liable to suit under sections 204 and 205 of the Act.

 The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which
the defendant resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the court has jurisdiction to assess
a civil penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court is to take into account
the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the
violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation,
the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.

Administrative penalty authority.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any civil penalty
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator
in a penalty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General
jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment.
Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment
of a civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the
procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions,
any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.

Effect of administrator's action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce
any provisions of the Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently
prosecuting an action under this paragraph, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to
further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be
the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph shall affect a person's obligation to comply with a section
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Finality of order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An order issued under this subsection is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review
is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Judicial review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the assessment
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged
to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal place of business is located, within
the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously send a copy
of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the
court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued.
The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph unless
substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless
the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional
civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any
proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part
after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5)
of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall request that the
Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest
at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the final
order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness
of the penalty is not subject to review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph
(c)(6)(i) of this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement
expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for
each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the
aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such
quarter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The manufacturer of each nonroad engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser
that the engine is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under
section 213 of the Act, and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform
with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as determined under &sect;89.104&hyph;96). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of the part may certify according to &sect;85.2112
that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with emission standards promulgated in this
part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad engine warranted under this part is responsible for the
proper maintenance of the engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at
a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any
other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of
the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated
by this Act.

maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout
their recall period (as defined under &sect;89.104&hyph;96(b)), the Administrator shall immediately notify the
manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity
of the engines with respect to which such notification is given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such engines which are properly used and maintained
will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer.

Administrator shall afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views
and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws
such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing,
order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)
of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect
to any class or category of engines shall be given to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and subsequent purchasers (if
known) in such manner and containing such information as required in subparts H and I of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) The manufacturer shall furnish with each new nonroad engine written instructions for the proper maintenance
and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under &sect;89.109&hyph;96. The manufacturer shall provide
in boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, replacement,
or repair of the emission control devices and systems may be performed by any nonroad engine repair establishment
or individual using any nonroad engine part which has been certified as provided in &sect;89.1007(a).

(ii) The instruction under paragraph (3)(i) of this section must not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's
using, in connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without
charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Subject
instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers
of such manufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a commercial relationship,
and service performed by independent nonroad engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial
relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine will function properly only if the component or
service so identified is used in connection with such engine, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In addition, the manufacturer shall indicate by means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the engine that
the engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of assuring achievement of emission standards
prescribed under section 213 of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to control of emissions
as prescribed under &sect;89.110&hyph;96. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The manufacturer bears all cost obligation a dealer incurs as a result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a)
of this section. The transfer of any such cost obligation from a manufacturer to a dealer through franchise or other
agreement is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement respecting the cost or value of emission control devices
or systems, the manufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems
by the Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, and his or her representatives,
has the same access for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer as the Comptroller
General has to those of a recipient of assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any inspection of a nonroad engine for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, after its sale to the ultimate
purchaser, is to be made only if the owner of such vehicle or engine voluntarily permits such inspection to be made,
except as may be provided by any state or local inspection program.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the Administration's initiative to reinvent Government, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
is issuing proposed regulations to improve the administrative process used by the Federal Employees' Group Life
Insurance (FEGLI) and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) programs in resolving disputes between Federal
employees and agencies over coverage and enrollment issues. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to improve
the performance of the Government by delegating to Federal agencies the authority to reconsider disputes over coverage
and enrollment issues in these two programs and to make retroactive as well as prospective corrections of errors.
The proposed regulations would result in more efficient Government operations and improved service to individuals
seeking benefits under the programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the FEGLI law, eligible employees are automatically insured under Basic Life insurance (generally equal to
their annual pay, rounded to the next thousand, plus $2,000), unless they waive coverage. In addition, employees
with Basic Life coverage may elect coverage under one or more of the 3 types of optional insurance available. (Standard
Optional offers an additional $10,000 of insurance. Additional Optional offers insurance in an amount of one, two,
three, four, or five times annual pay rounded to the next thousand. Family Optional offers $5,000 insurance for the
spouse and $2,500 for each child.) OPM's regulations prescribe the circumstances under which employees cancel waivers
of Basic Life, elect optional coverage, increase optional coverage, or drop coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the FEHB Program, eligible employees may enroll in FEHB when they are first hired. They may enroll or change enrollment
during open season, when their family status changes, or at other times prescribed by OPM's regulations. The FEHB
law also provides for enrollment by certain former employees, former spouses, and children when they lose regular
FEHB coverage because of separation from service or loss of family member status. The specific conditions of their
enrollment and opportunities to change enrollment are controlled by OPM's regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employees (and family members who are eligible to enroll in FEHB) make changes in their life insurance coverage and
health benefits enrollment through the employee's personnel office. These administrative actions are normally
conducted entirely between the agency and the individual, based on FEGLI and FEHB law and regulations. However, occasions
arise when individuals challenge the agency's denial of their request for coverage, to change their FEHB enrollment
or FEGLI coverage, or to change their FEGB enrollment or FEGLI optional coverage retroactively. (Because Basic Life
insurance coverage is mandatory under FEGLI law unless the employee waives it, an agency that erroneously denies
Basic Life to an employee must restore it retroactively when the error is discovered.) Under OPM's regulations, elections
of optional life insurance coverage and FEHB enrollment or enrollment changes are generally effective prospectively
unless a specific statutory or regulatory provision requires or allows the agency to make a retroactive change. Errors
that consist of allowing an employee to elect life insurance coverage under circumstances not prescribed by law or
regulation are corrected retroactively, including errors that are not discovered until after the death of an insured
employee.) The current process used to resolve disputes between individuals and agencies over coverage or enrollment
determinations is described in 5 CFR &sect;&sect;870.205, 871.206, 872.206, 873.206, 874.305, and 890.104. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these current procedures, employees, children, or former spouses who are denied coverage or enrollment, the
opportunity to change coverage or enrollment, or, in most cases, to have a change made retroactively by a Federal agency
must write to the Office of Personnel Management within 30 days after the agency's written denial if they believe the
agency's decision was incorrect and want to have it reviewed. OPM reviews the agency's denial to determine if it complies
with the applicable law and regulations. Since agencies currently do not have the regulatory authority to make retroactive
changes in most cases, they must deny most such requests. Therefore, most requests for a retroactive change must come
to OPM for review before the retroactive change can be made. (Basic life insurance is an exception. Under the FEGLI
law, employees are automatically covered for Basic Life insurance; therefore, agencies must correct failures to
withhold retroactively.) In addition, OPM has the authority, by regulation, to order corrections of errors, mistakes,
or omissions based on its determination that it would be against equity and good conscience not to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, OPM received 283 requests for reconsideration and upheld the agency's decision in 39 percent of the cases.
OPM overturned 38 percent of agency decisions and returned 23 percent to the agency because the individual failed
to follow proper administrative procedures. As of August 30, 1993, there has been a 50 percent increase in requests
for reconsideration over the 1992 figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many of these cases, the issue was (or included) a request that the coverage or change in coverage be made retroactive
to some earlier date. Out of 94 requests from employees involving retroactive coverage, we allowed 70 and denied 24.
Although an agency has all the necessary information at its disposal and knows whether a retroactive correction is
appropriate, it lacks the authority under current regulations to make corrections retroactively. It can accept
the employee's request to enroll or change enrollment, but only on a prospective basis. The agency must deny the employee's
request for a retroactive change. Therefore, the employees write to OPM to have the decision reviewed. If appropriate,
OPM can then order the agency to make the retroactive correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of OPM's ongoing efforts to improve efficiency, and in keeping with the Administration's initiative to streamline
Government operations, OPM is issuing proposed regulations that would delegate to Federal agencies the authority
to correct coverage and enrollment errors retroactively. In addition, the proposed regulations would transfer
the reconsideration (review) process for the FEGLI and FEHB programs from OPM to the agencies. Under the proposed
regulations, Federal agencies (or retirement systems, if applicable) would make the initial decisions at the employing
office level and would provide for reconsideration at a higher, or otherwise independent, level of review. The reconsideration
could, at each agency's discretion, be made at a higher level within the employing office or at the same level elsewhere
in the agency. The proposed regulations set forth only the most basic elements necessary to meet due process requirements.
For the most part, agencies would be free to use existing administrative review procedures that include these basic
elements or to create administrative procedures specific to this purpose. The agency's decision based on its reconsideration
of the initial decision would be final. (FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection
Board.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations regarding employee withholdings and Government contributions would continue to apply. That
is, when agencies make retroactive changes, the agency must pay into the respective trust fund an amount equal to any
withholdings and contributions due from the effective date of the change. The agency may collect the amount of the
withholdings due from the employee or may waive collection under existing law and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the authority to make retroactive changes conferred by the proposed regulations, the agencies could correct
errors promptly, review initial decisions on request, and give the individual a thorough, written explanation of
the final decision. Thus, we believe that the Government would operate more efficiently and employees, their children,
and their former spouses would be better served under these regulations.

Executive Orders 12866 and 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule has been determined not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and has been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions
of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting
a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the
petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the
ruling.

Effect on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption
level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41
percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It
is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate
increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying
hens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment
of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The
present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton
of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent
of the wholesale price of a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average wholesale price for
New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991&hyph;93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately $7.5 million
annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent assessment.
It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened research
and promotion programs.

Background and Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 14, 1993, the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2711) was amended (Pub. L. 103&hyph;188)
to increase the maximum rate of assessment, raise the exemption level, and provide for research project funding.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the amended section 8 of the Act, the maximum rate of assessment was raised from 10 cents to 20 cents per case of
commercial eggs. The actual assessment rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order and is currently
5 cents per case. Producers owning 30,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments and other provisions
of the Act. Section 12 of the Act was amended to increase the exemption level to 75,000 or fewer hens. A proposed rule
to raise the exemption level in the Order was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1994. The new exemption level will become effective after publication of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act amendments provide that AEB may recommend an increase in the assessment rate to the Secretary. The recommendation
must be based on a scientific study, marketing analysis, or other evidence demonstrating a need for the increase.
Consequently, AEB conducted a marketing analysis and evaluated the advertising and nutrition research programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Advertising
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AEB began its first advertising campaign in 1977. For the next 3 years, media expenditures averaged $3.5 million annually.
In 1980, the American Association of Advertising Agencies noted that, during that 3-year period, per capita consumption
of eggs had increased and consumer attitudes toward eggs had improved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering inflation, an estimated $9 million would be required for AEB to conduct a media program in 1994 comparable
to that in 1977. Further, because consumers have grown more concerned with a variety of issues affecting egg consumption,
an even greater level of funding would be needed to achieve the same results today.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AEB's analysis establishes that egg consumption has been steadily declining over many years. In fact, USDA statistics
show that per capita consumption dropped from 402 in 1945 to 234 in 1993. In general, the decline is attributed to fewer
egg-consuming households and less frequent egg consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eggs face certain barriers in the marketplace which have contributed to the declining consumption. Considered by
consumers to be primarily a breakfast food, eggs must compete with a variety of breakfast alternatives: cold cereal;
pancakes and waffles; rolls, muffins, and toast; and hot cereal. The total measured media spending for the breakfast
food category was $937 million in 1993. Egg industry advertising-including that funded by AEB, State and regional
associations, and companies promoting name brands-represents only 0.7 percent of that amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, consumer concerns with fat and cholesterol have significantly affected consumer eating habits. The
judgment that eggs are high in cholesterol has further contributed to consumers using fewer eggs. Overcoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative consumer attitudes is even more difficult when other breakfast foods are more heavily promoted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AEB's current advertising strategy is three-fold: (1) Educate consumers about eggs and cholesterol by providing
facts on egg cholesterol in a healthy diet; (2) remind consumers how much they love the great taste of eggs; and (3) connect
eggs with the rich, pleasurable associations people have with eggs and egg-eating occasions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current ``I Love Eggs'' advertising campaign based on this strategy proved effective in consumer testing. Prior
to being exposed to the advertising, 43 percent of consumers tested had extremely positive or very positive attitudes
about eggs. This number increased by 13 percent after consumers were exposed to the advertising. Further, almost
half of the consumers tested reported an increased likelihood of eating and serving eggs more often.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With current funding, AEB has earmarked about $2.8 million for this campaign in 1995. This budget supports 15-second
television commercials and 30-second radio spots. A 5-cent increase in the assessment rate would allow for an advertising
budget of $7.5 million. This budget would enable the use of more effective 30-second television spots; allow advertising
to be aired almost every other week, as opposed to the 10 weeks per year now; and provide for over 1,000 additional commercial
announcements. Most significantly, an additional one million target households would be reached by AEB advertising
each week.

Nutrition Research
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nutrition portion of AEB's budget encompasses two programs of importance both for the egg industry and the consuming
public-nutrition research and nutrition education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, an increased amount of the AEB budget has been used for research to evaluate the effects of dietary
cholesterol on plasma lipids. Since 1991, $1.3 million has funded research projects at various universities, all
of which have focused on this issue. For example, a recently completed study was published in the April issue of the
American Heart Association's ``Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis'' journal. The results of this study found that
blood cholesterol levels in young healthy men did not significantly increase when they were fed 1 or 2 eggs per day.
Additional funding would allow the egg industry to study the same effects across other population groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased funding also would allow AEB to expand its contacts with scientists, health professionals, and the media
in developing nutrition materials, sponsoring scientific symposiums and related forums, and compiling research
data.

AEB Recommendation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the March 17, 1994, Board meeting in Chicago, Illinois, AEB members voted unanimously to recommend that the assessment
rate be increased from 5 cents to 10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. Their decision was based on the marketing
analysis as well as an overall sense from producers nationwide that more funds are necessary to help improve the position
of the industry's products in the marketplace through strengthened advertising and research programs. AEB further
requested that a referendum on this increase be held as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Referendum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After an opportunity for public comment, a referendum will be held among egg producers not exempt from the Act. Producers
engaged in the production of commercial eggs during a representative period determined by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be eligible to vote on the assessment rate change proposed by AEB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All known eligible egg producers will receive information in the mail regarding the referendum. It is anticipated
that the 75,000-hen exemption level will be in place before the referendum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the assessment rate shall become effective if the change is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds
of the producers voting in the referendum, or a majority of such producers if they represent not less than two-thirds
of the commercial eggs produced by those voting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
During the late 1980s, the credit reporting industry developed a product, called the ``risk score,'' to evaluate
a consumer's credit history for its clients. A risk score assesses the likelihood of a particular adverse event, such
as default or bankruptcy, based on various factors in a consumer report. The result of this evaluation is communicated
by means of a numerical score.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 609 of the FCRA requires a consumer reporting agency, upon receiving a request and proper identification
from a consumer, to ``clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer .&blank;.&blank;. [t]he nature and substance
of all information (except medical information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.'' A consumer
reporting agency also must disclose, in most instances, the sources of the information in the consumer's file, as
well as the recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which the reporting agency has furnished six months preceding
the consumer's request (or two years, if the report is for employment purposes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On February 11, 1992, the Commission amended its FCRA Commentary to state that, pursuant to section 609 of the FCRA,
``a risk score (or other numerical evaluation, however named) that is reported by a consumer reporting agency to a
client to assist in evaluating a consumer's eligibility for credit (or other permissible purposes) must be disclosed
(along with an explanation of the risk score)'' to a consumer requesting disclosure of his or her credit file from the
consumer reporting agency. 57 FR 4935&hyph;36 (Feb. 11, 1992). It noted that Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan, when
introducing the conference report on the bill that ultimately enacted the FCRA, had stated:

(The House conferees) stressed that the consumer should have access to all information 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
in any form which would be relayed to a prospective employer, insurer or creditor in making a judgment as to the worthiness
of the individual's application for such benefits.*&blank;*&blank;* It is not intended that the credit reporting
firm should have a free hand in excluding from the consumer's access information other than medical information it
just does not want to give him, but will give to a client-user.

After the Commission amended the FCRA Commentary, several industry representatives requested clarification of
the revision. As part of this process, some of these parties (as well as consumer representatives and other interested
parties) submitted informal statements of their positions that appear on the Commission's public record. Commissioners
and Bureau of Consumer Protection staff have discussed these issues with industry, consumer and state representatives.
During these discussions, the following three principal issues arose concerning the applicability of the FCRA to
risk scores: (1) When a consumer reporting agency must disclose a risk score; (2) what score(s) must be disclosed;
and (3) what type of explanation of the score, if any, must be provided as part of the disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these inquiries, the Commission proposes to expand the discussion of risk scores in the FCRA Commentary
as set forth below.

Proposed Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission proposes to delete the single sentence that discusses ``risk scores'' in comment 7 to section 609 of
the FCRA Commentary, and to add a separate comment 12 to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

12. Risk scores. A consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer in response to a consumer's disclosure request:
(a) risk scores (or other numerical evaluations, however named), calculated at the time of the consumer's request;
and (b) a brief statement that explains what the risk score predicts, how the score may be applied by its user, and how
the consumer ranks against other consumers under the scoring model. The agency must disclose this information for
each type of score, regardless of who developed the score, that the agency has reported to its clients within the six
months preceding the date of the consumer's disclosure request (or within two years, if for employment purposes).

Questions for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission requests public comment on this proposed revision to the FCRA Commentary, and is particularly interested
in receiving comments on the questions that follow. Legal and policy analysis of these questions would be particularly
useful. The Commission specifically requests comments based on reasoned analysis of provisions of the FCRA that
discuss the impact of the proposal on consumers and the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What type of risk score disclosure is mandated under section 609 of the FCRA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consumer reporting agencies generally calculate risk scores only when they receive a request for such a score
from a client. Is a consumer entitled to a risk score disclosure if the consumer reporting agency has never reported
a score on that individual? Assuming some prior risk score report is necessary to trigger the disclosure requirement,
does a risk score provided by a consumer reporting agency only in the context of ``prescreening'' provide an appropriate
trigger? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If provision of a risk score to a client is an appropriate trigger for the disclosure requirement, in what time frame,
if any, must that score have been provided? Are each of the proposed time frames, which are based on sections 609(a)(3)
and 611(d) of the FCRA, proper and sensible? Are they unduly burdensome on credit bureaus or insufficient to provide
adequate disclosure to consumers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Risk scoring systems can be created by or for consumer reporting agencies themselves (``generic models''), or
they can be created by or for one or more of the agency's clients (``custom models''). Should the disclosure requirement
for risk scores based on generic models and custom models be the same? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Credit files are constantly changing. New items are added while older items become statutorily obsolete and are
dropped. Because of the dynamic nature of consumer reports, the risk score that is reported to a creditor at any given
time may differ from the score that would be assigned to that report at a time shortly thereafter. Should ``historical''
risk scores (those actually provided to the agency's clients) or ``current'' risk scores (calculated at the time
of the disclosure) be disclosed to consumers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A consumer reporting agency may produce a variety of different risk scores, such as a bankruptcy risk score, a default
risk score, or other types of scores. Should the consumer reporting agency be required to disclose to consumers each
type of risk score it offers its clients the option of purchasing, or only those scores that have actually been provided
about that consumer to one or more clients? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) What explanation, if any, should a consumer reporting agency provide consumers about their risk scores? Should
agencies discuss how the score may be used by their clients? Should agencies specify how the individual consumer ranks
in regard to others? If so, should the ranking be done by percentile or other technique? Should the Commentary specify
the precise form of explanation, or contain expanded requirements as to the details of the explanation? Is the proposal
to require an explanation of the risk score too narrow or too broad? If so, in what way should it be expanded or contracted?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Is there some approach other than disclosure of actual risk scores that would better inform consumers of the information
about them being reported by consumer reporting agencies? For example, might it be more useful for a consumer reporting
agency to provide a single score to all consumers designed to show the likelihood of obtaining credit? Would it be more
helpful for the consumer to receive a list of the elements on which the calculation of such a ``score'' is based, rather
than the actual score and explanation required by the proposal?

A consumer reporting agency is not required to disclose information consisting of an audit trail of changes it makes
in the consumer's file, billing records, or the contents of a consumer relations folder, if the information is not
from consumer reports and will not be used in preparing future consumer reports. Such data is not included in the term
``information in the files'' which must be disclosed to the consumer pursuant to this section. A consumer reporting
agency must disclose claims report information only if it has appeared in consumer reports.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document withdraws the proposed amendment to the Customs Regulations, which would have permitted drawback
claimants to file only one application for use of the exporter's summary procedure, instead of filing separate applications
for the use of the procedure for each Customs region or district in which they file drawback claims. Customs has determined
that any amendment of the exporter's summary procedure, including any necessary provisions to ensure uniformity
in approving or revoking the use of this procedure, would more appropriately be considered in concert with the broad-based
review and revision of the drawback regulations necessitated by, and which will shortly be undertaken pursuant to,
the Customs modernization portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Drawback is a refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax, or fee. There are a number
of different kinds of drawback authorized under law. In order to qualify for drawback, there must be an exportation
or a destruction under Customs supervision. The statute providing for specific types of drawback is 19 U.S.C. 1313.
The Customs Regulations implementing the statute are contained in 19 CFR part 191. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for establishing the exportation of goods subject to drawback are set forth in subpart E of part 191.
This subpart authorizes the use of several alternative procedures to establish exportation. One of these is the exporter's
summary procedure, which is provided for in &sect;191.53. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the exporter's summary procedure, the claimant is allowed to establish exportation for drawback simply by
summarizing his exports in chronological order, along with certain associated data, using a format acceptable to
the appropriate regional commissioner or district director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drawback claimant wishing to use the exporter's summary procedure must first make application with each regional
commissioner, or, if applicable, with each district director, in whose region or district drawback will be sought.
The regional commissioner or the district director, if applicable, would approve the request, if it is determined
that the use of the procedure would contribute to administrative efficiency, and the claimant is not otherwise delinquent
or remiss in transactions with Customs. This can result in excessive paperwork. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, by a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 10, 1992 (57 FR 41446), Customs proposed to amend paragraph (c) of &sect;191.53 so that drawback claimants
would not have to file separate applications to use the exporter's summary procedure in each region or district where
they file drawback claims. Approval, denial, or revocation of a claimant's use of the procedure in one region or district
would govern the claimant's eligibility in all regions and districts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While three commenters responded to the notice of proposed rulemaking, all generally favoring adoption of the proposal,
the concern was expressed that there was a lack of uniformity among the various regions and districts in processing
applications to use the exporter's summary procedure. This problem was not resolved or addressed by the regulation
in question.

Withdrawal of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the foregoing, and, moreover, in view of the extensive drawback regulation changes necessitated
by the Customs modernization portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;182, &sect;632), Customs has now determined that any amendment of the exporter's summary procedure,
including any necessary provisions to ensure 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniformity in approving or revoking the use of this procedure, would more properly be considered in concert with the
broad-based review and revision of the drawback regulations which will be shortly undertaken pursuant to the Customs
modernization portion of the NAFTA Implementation Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 39 U.S.C. 401(4), the Postal Service has the general power to determine and keep its own system of accounts and
the forms and contents of its contracts and other business documents. In the past, for freight invoicing purposes,
the Postal Service has generally used Government Bills of Lading, Standard Form 1103 (SF 1103), in accordance with
the procedures set forth in 41 CFR 101&hyph;41.000, et seq. The Postal Service is considering changes to its payment
system that would affect invoicing procedures for all freight transportation carriers currently handling shipments
on Government Bills of Lading. Shipments of U.S. Mail, household goods, or other personal property not handled on
SF 1103 would not be covered by the new payment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This change would permit the Postal Service to implement new software applications for freight traffic management.
The principal feature of the new system would be to permit freight carriers to submit billings either electronically,
or by paper invoices using the Public Voucher, Standard Form 1113 (SF 1113), along with the required supporting documentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New billing procedures would be drafted to provide guidance both for electronic and paper billing. These procedures
would include information about the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) approval process, Trading Partner Agreements,
submission of electronic invoices, testing rejection and resubmission of valid invoices, payments, and suspension
of EDI operations. Information about waivers, payee codes, and other payment processes would also be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that freight carriers electing to conduct business electronically should be required
to use the EDI Standards X12, developed by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI). The Postal Service would obtain commercial EDI Value-Added Network (VAN) services to send and
receive EDI shipping and billing data. Carriers would be required to use the VAN selected by the Postal Service to transfer
data electronically for these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although existing procedures for issuing and paying Government Bills of Lading for Postal Service shipments will
continue, one change would be required to be consistent with electronic practices, if they are implemented. Any carrier
submitting paper billings would be required to include its Tax Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 1113. A TIN for
a parent company would also be required if the carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company. The carrier TIN would be used
for vendor identification during payment processing; the Postal Service would not assign its own vendor supplier
code for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the foregoing, the Postal Service requests comments and proposals from interested parties on the following
matters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The level of carrier interest in electronic communications to replace hardcopy bills of lading and freight bills.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The procedures carriers would prefer to see used for handling these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The impact upon carriers of adding the carrier's TIN to SF 1113.

Comments regarding these matters are requested within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. The Postal
Service will take these comments under consideration as it formulates possible changes in its payment system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service proposes changes to several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards defining a mailpiece's length,
height, and thickness, and relating these dimensions to processing category and other criteria. The Postal Service
also proposes changes to other DMM standards concerning the content and placement of delivery and return addresses,
including placement standards for delivery addresses on flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure,
and letter- and flat-size pieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper; the location of, and the use
of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in, the return address on certain mail; terms related to post office boxes and standards for
their use in addressing mail; and the prohibition of dual addresses on certain types of mail.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These proposed changes to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards arise from suggestions presented during the 1993
DMM redesign project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Revisions Concerning Physical Mailpiece Dimensions and Address Placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to C010 and C050 (with lesser changes to A010, A200, and E312) concern how the physical characteristics
of a mailpiece are used in determining which dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is used to determine correct address placement and the mailpiece's mailability, susceptibility
to a nonstandard surcharge, processing category, and rate eligibility. This proposal will apply a consistent definition
of length, height, and thickness to all mail, except for pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposal affects all addressed mail, its impact will be on address placement on letter-size pieces
(including, for purposes of these standards, cards), which are subject to standards for address placement and orientation
and rate eligibility based on those characteristics. The Postal Service proposes to make the following specific
changes to the DMM: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A010.1.0 is amended to standardize address placement on all letter-size mail claimed at other than a single-piece
rate (or, for pieces within a small dimensional range, at the Barcoded rate for flats) to require that the address be
oriented parallel to the length of the piece (as defined in revised C010.1.1). Letter-size mail, which represents
the majority of postal volume, is processed in a mostly automated or mechanized mailstream. An increasing proportion
of letter-size mail (already subject to strict physical standards) moves through automated equipment, and most
of the remainder is handled by letter-sorting machines. Manual processing_the slowest and most costly handling_is
used for mail having physical or address characteristics that are incompatible with automated or mechanized processing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Postal Service recognizes that some mail may never be compatible with its equipment, it believes that
such compatibility is a reasonable condition for mail being claimed at a discounted rate. Whether to render a mailpiece
compatible with automation (as under existing standards), mechanization, or human handling, the benefit of the
proposed rule is clear. Certain necessary, basic assumptions about how mail is oriented when its address is to be read
underlie how equipment is designed to receive and move mail and how employees are trained to read, sort, and carry it.
Most letter-size mail has address and dimensional characteristics that are compatible with these assumptions,
but the absence of effective standards allows incompatible mail to enjoy discounts that are incongruous with how
it must be processed. (Nonstandard surcharges do not apply to all such mail.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the sake of creativity, some customers currently generate mail at bulk or presort rates that must be held vertically
(``portrait'' style) rather than horizontally (``landscape'' style) to read the delivery address. Such mailpieces
must be processed manually because they are incompatible with Postal Service automation and mechanized letter-sorting
machines. These pieces cause problems even for the letter carrier, who must turn them to sort and again to deliver.
The Postal Service acknowledges that this proposal will inhibit such mailpiece design practices. However, the benefit
of facilitating efficient processing_for cost and for service_outweighs the minor loss of creative latitude that
will result if the proposed rule is adopted. (Mailers to whom this creative latitude is truly significant will have
the option of mailing pieces at single-piece rates.) However, given the relative proportion of the mailstream represented
by incompatible bulk or presort rate letter-size mail, compared with the volume that is compatible, the Postal Service
believes that few mailers will be impacted by the effects on mailpiece design of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A010.1.0 and A200.1.3 are revised to add mandatory address placement standards for other-than-single-piece
rate flat-size mail prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, or otherwise not prepared in an envelope,
polybag, or similar enclosure. The types of mail affected by this standard are relatively difficult and costly to
process and sort; the second type has the added potential to come apart in the mail, resulting in its failure to reach
the addressee. None of these circumstances benefits the mailer, the Postal Service, or the addressee. The proposed
change will further Postal Service efforts to provide efficient and timely service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these mandatory placement standards affects flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure and
that may have an open edge presented either forward (as the piece travels through mechanization) or to the right (as
the piece is held for manual sortation, casing, or delivery). The proposed revisions would require that such mail
be addressed so that, when oriented to read the address, the mailpiece is positioned for more efficient processing,
i.e., with its bound or final-folded edge to the right, and that pieces in partial wrappers or sleeves would have to
have the open ends at the top and bottom of the mailpiece. The Postal Service, which has traditionally recommended
that such mail be addressed in the manner described in the proposed rule (see existing Exhibit A200.1.3), has received
only limited cooperation from mailers and, consequently, has been unable to improve the efficiency with which that
mail can be handled. Some mailers (and some postal employees) have said that they were uncertain about whether the
proposed placement was previously required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing this standard, the Postal Service seeks to balance the needs of the mailing community with its own operational
need to curtail undesirable addressing practices that raise postal costs. Further, the Postal Service realizes
that, if adopted as a final rule, the operational effect of this proposal on some mailers would require considerable
lead time before actual implementation. Therefore, commenters who are concerned about the effect this proposal
would have on their operations are asked to provide specific information and suggestions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How could the problems associated with handling the affected mail be overcome by measures other than the proposed
rule as written? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What are commenters prepared to do to make that mail more efficient to handle? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proposed rule is adopted, how much lead time would be needed to make the necessary internal operational changes?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Would a short-term general implementation date be acceptable if the Postal Service worked with individual customers
and allowed specific exceptions for delayed implementation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second mandatory address placement standard requires that flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve
or partial wrapper must bear a delivery address on the item being mailed itself, by addressing just the item (provided
that the address remains visible when the item is mailed), by addressing both the item and the wrapper, or by using an
address label to firmly attach the item and its wrapper. (Flat-size pieces would also have to meet the standard proposed
above.) The Postal Service has no preference for the method chosen, instead focusing on the objective: Ensuring that
separation of the item and its wrapper do not result in the item becoming undeliverable. Some customers have complained
that existing addressing methods sometimes cause them not to get this type of mail or to receive only the wrapper, pointing
out that the Postal Service's tolerance of the underlying addressing practice is contrary to the best interests of
the addressee. Recognizing the validity of these complaints, the Postal Service proposes to require those mailers
who generate flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper to move to an addressing method
that corrects the problem just described. Commenters who object to this proposal are asked to provide constructive
responses to the same questions asked for in the proposed revision discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For consistency, A200.1.3 would be revised to incorporate a reference to the foregoing sections. Other organizational
changes are proposed to A010.1.0 that do not affect the substance of the standards.

3. C010.1.0 is amended to reduce the role of address placement in the determination of which of a mailpiece's physical
dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. Existing standards are inconsistent in associating these basic
physical dimensions to the delivery address. The proposed rule would remedy this by establishing consistent definitions,
based on the physical characteristics of the mailpiece. For the typical letter-size piece, the proposed rule always
defines its length (horizontal dimension) as the longest dimension; the mailpiece's height (vertical dimension)
is the next longest dimension, and the thickness is the remaining dimension. Variations on this rule are proposed
for pieces that do not have three unequal dimensions. While the Postal Service realizes that this change may affect
a small volume of customer mail, as discussed above, the benefits of the consistent definitions contained in the changes
proposed below, and of the processing efficiencies of the mail these proposals would produce, far outweigh any loss
of creative latitude. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. C050.1.0 is amended for consistency. By the revised wording, assignment of most mailpieces to a processing category
depends solely on their dimensions as determined by C010.1.0. Existing standards base processing category on physical
dimensions, without regard to address placement, so that the proposed rule, in effect, makes only minor changes to
ensure that this section is harmonious with those discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. C050.5.0 is amended to make it clear that merchandise samples are not by definition always irregular parcels, and
may be categorized as letter- or flat-size pieces based on the usual criteria.

1. These proposed changes to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards relate to the content and placement of delivery
and return addresses. The proposed revisions are intended to serve two general purposes: making existing standards
more consistent and improving the address quality of mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revisions to the standards in A010.4.3 and 4.5 are proposed to mandate the use of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in the return
address on certain mail. (The standard for required use of a return address is not changed by these proposals.) Specifically,
by the proposed revision to A010.4.3, the correct ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code would be required in the return address on any
mail where a return address is itself required under existing standards. Further, by the proposed change to A010.4.5,
the existing placement standard for the return address on mail claimed at a ZIP+4 rate is both made more specific and
extended to all mail on which a return address is required. Under the proposed rule, the return address must be placed
in the top left corner of the address side, area, or label of the mailpiece, parallel to the delivery address. On ZIP+4
rate cards and letter-size mailpieces that do not bear a delivery point barcode, the return address would have to be
outside the OCR read area (a current requirement applied broadly to all ZIP+4 rate mail). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions should facilitate the accurate and efficient return of mail by making complete return address
information available in a readily identifiable location. Because mailers know their own ZIP Codes, the Postal Service
believes that the proposed standards do not represent either a significant new burden on customers or one that customers
will have serious problems in implementing. Customers who believe that deferred implementation will be necessary
are asked to indicate this in their comments, with an explanation of why they require deferral and how long an adjustment
period they require, and should propose appropriate terms for excepting those mailers/mailings while the necessary
operational adjustments are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A010.5.3 is added to clarify the meaning and appropriate use of the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO
Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations. These terms are sometimes incorrectly used to denote destinations
other than post office box or caller service, such as a rural or highway contract route box, a college or business mailroom
box, or a private commercial mail receiving agent. As a result, the imprecise use of terms conveys incorrect information
or causes misinterpretation, either of which sometimes impedes the Postal Service in providing the desired service_delivering
the mail where the sender intends. The potential for misdelivery has increased in today's automated mail processing
environment: Optical character readers scan and ``read'' addresses to determine the correct delivery point barcode
to assign to the mailpiece. Once this barcode is applied, the mailpiece is processed with minimal human intervention
so that ambiguous address information applied by the mailer may result in a misdirected mailpiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid these potential delivery problems, the proposed standard defines the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O.
Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations as referring exclusively to the delivery services
provided by the Postal Service under D910 and D920 (Post Office Box Service and Caller Service, respectively). The
proposed standard states that those terms are always included in the correct address of mail destined for post office
box or caller service addresses, that they are incorrect for mail intended for other addresses, and that the Postal
Service cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly addressed mail. (Correct addressing practices are described
in detail in Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards, available from postal business centers and larger post
offices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule will not have an adverse affect on customers because it merely clarifies the correct use of these
terms. Moreover, many large mailers have already taken measures to improve the quality of their address lists, and
may have already standardized such lists in conformance with the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A010.3.2c is also revised for organizational consistency.

5. Proposed changes to A010.5.1 should minimize the problems associated with dual addresses. Dual addresses, which
typically include both a street address and a post office box, can lead to confusion for USPS employees identifying
to which location the Postal Service is expected to make delivery despite the existing standards that the address
immediately above the city-state-ZIP Code line takes precedence. Dual addressing can result in a potential for misdelivery
(to the unintended address) as well as the potential for confusion and dissatisfaction on the part of the sender, addressee,
or both. (Under the proposed rule, for those ZIP Code areas having no delivery service other than by post office box
service, the correct address will be to the intended recipient's post office box address.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accurate delivery to the intended addressee is always important, but more so when the item has been identified by the
sender as having exceptional value through the level of service selected (e.g., Express Mail or Priority Mail, or
registered, certified, restricted delivery, or special delivery mail). Therefore, under the proposed rule, dual
addresses are prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on those types of mail. Although this change may cause
occasional inconvenience for some customers, the Postal Service believes that any inconvenience is more than offset
by elimination of the ambiguity and delay potentially associated with dual addressing. This benefit is particularly
true because the sender has invested a relatively large sum to ensure safe and accurate delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also prohibits dual addresses on any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. Because of the problems
described above, allowing dual addressing on this mail would be inconsistent with the Postal Service's ongoing efforts
to improve address quality in volume mailings. Whereas this prohibition may have the appearance of a sweeping new
requirement, its net affect should be minimal. Most mailers who use bulk or presort rates have enough awareness of
addressing standards to know why dual addresses are not advisable and, therefore, seldom use them. The majority of
those same mailers are already involved in ongoing address management to improve the quality of their addressing
practices.

Specific conditions apply to certain types of mail; for purposes of these standards, letter-size mailpieces include
cards; flat-size mailpieces include letter-size pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size mailpiece unless that piece is paid at a single-piece
rate. Letter-size mailpieces bearing an address oriented otherwise are not eligible for any presort or automation-based
discount and may be nonmailable or subject to a nonstandard surcharge. First-Class card-rate pieces and all mail
claimed at an automation rate are subject to additional standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. If flat-size mail is not prepared in an envelope, polybag, or similar complete enclosure, the delivery address
must be placed so that when the mailpiece is held to read the address, the bound edge or (if applicable) final-folded
edge of the mailpiece is to the right, the address is at the top of the mailpiece parallel with the top edge, and, for mailpieces
prepared in a sleeve or partial wrapper, the open ends of the sleeve or partial wrapper are at the top and bottom of the
mailpiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If flat-size mail is prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, the address must be placed on the enclosed
material so that it can be read without moving the wrapper, or on both the wrapper and the enclosed matter, unless the
address label is used to attach the wrapper to the enclosed matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. If mail including an attachment does not bear the name and address of both the sender and intended recipient on both
the host and the attachment, the sender's name and address must be placed on the host piece or the delivery address label
(which may also show the return address) must be used to affix the attachment securely to the host. Combination containers
that have inseparable parts or compartments (e.g., cartons with letter-size envelopes completely and securely
attached to one side) are mailable with the names and addresses on only one.

must not be in the OCR read area, and must not extend farther than one-half the length of the mailpiece to the right edge,
and no lower than one-third the height of the mailpiece from the top (see Exhibit 4.5).

Dual Address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A dual address is one that contains two delivery points, e.g., a street address and a post office box number (see Exhibit
5.1), and is subject to these restrictions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A dual address is prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on Express Mail, Priority Mail, special delivery
mail, registered mail, certified mail, restricted delivery mail, and any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Other mail bearing a dual address is delivered (or returned, as applicable) to the address immediately above the
city and state (or to the post office box if both the street address and post office box are on the same line). If a ZIP+4
code or 5-digit ZIP Code is used in any dual address, it must correspond to the address element immediately above the
city and state (or with the post office box number in the address if both the street address and post office box are on
the same line).

The terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``P. O. B.,'' ``POB,'' and other similar combinations refer
exclusively to the delivery services provided by the USPS under D910 and D920, and the correct address for those services
always includes one of these terms. These terms are not correctly used on mail intended for delivery through a private
box system or to other types of addresses (e.g., rural route boxes). The USPS cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly
addressed mail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided by 1.6, mailpiece length and height are determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For pieces having three different dimensions, the longest dimension of a mailpiece is its length (horizontal dimension);
the next longest, its height (vertical dimension); the shortest, its thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. For pieces having two equal dimensions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the third dimension is longer than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's length (horizontal dimension);
the remaining dimensions are its height and thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the third dimension is shorter than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's thickness; of the remaining
dimensions, the length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is the remaining dimension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. For pieces having three equal dimensions, or having an irregular shape, or requiring a specific orientation because
of the contents, the location and orientation of the address on the mailpiece establish which dimensions are its height
and length. The length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is perpendicular to the length on
the address side of the piece.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to disapprove the Operating Permits Program submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose
of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources. The reasons for proposing disapproval
are as follows: Virginia's program does not contain the necessary legal authority to afford judicial review to persons
who have participated in the public comment process, and it also does not contain the necessary legal authority to
prevent default issuance of a permit. The submitted regulations have an expiration date of June 28, 1994 and cannot
be applied or enforced after that date. Also, the regulatory portion of the program does not include the proper universe
of sources required to be subject to a state operating permit program or ensure that permits contain all applicable
requirements, or correctly delineating provisions enforceable only by the Commonwealth. In addition, there are
other deficiencies in Virginia's submitted program, as specified in the Technical Support Document, which must
be corrected before EPA can grant full approval to Virginia's operating permits program.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``CAA''), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements
of an approvable state operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA
will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)).
These rules are codified at 40 CFR part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires that states develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA take actions
to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs
pursuant to section 502 of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by November 15, 1995, or by the end of an interim
program period, it must establish and implement a Federal operating permits program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 12, 1993, Virginia submitted an operating permits program for review by EPA. It was received by EPA on November
19, 1994. The submittal was supplemented by a letter dated January 14, 1994, and was found to be administratively complete
pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(e)(1). The submittal contains a program description, a legal opinion from the Virginia Attorney
General, confirmation of regulatory authority, program and fee regulations, relevant portions of Virginia statutes,
guidance and forms, a description of enforcement provisions, a resource and fee demonstration, and a transition
plan.

B. Federal Oversight and Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sanctions must be imposed 18 months after EPA disapproves a state submittal, unless prior to expiration of the 18-month
period the state submits a revised program that EPA approves. If a state has not submitted a revised program that EPA
approves within 6 months after EPA applies the first sanction, a second sanction is required. In addition, discretionary
sanctions may be applied any time during the 18-month period following the date required for program submittal or
the date of program disapproval. If the Commonwealth does not have an approved program by November 15, 1995, EPA must
promulgate, administer, and enforce a Federal operating permits program for the Commonwealth.

II. Summary and Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis contained in this document focuses on the major portions of Virginia's submittal and particularly portions
which must be corrected to meet the minimum requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The full program submittal, the Technical
Support Document, and other relevant materials are available for detailed information as part of the public docket.
The docket may be viewed during regular business hours at the address listed above.

A. Statutory Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Standing for Judicial Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Attorney General of the Commonwealth, in his opinion dated November 5, 1993, states that ``the laws of the Commonwealth
provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the Commonwealth's program for Federal operating permits.''
The Attorney General cites Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1318(B) as providing an opportunity for judicial review to
any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the State Air Pollution Control Board and who meets certain criteria,
including having an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest. The requirement for standing for judicial
review, as specifically required by section 502(b)(6) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x), must provide standing
for any person who has participated in the public comment process and any other person who could obtain judicial review
of that action under applicable law. EPA interprets section 502(b)(6) of the CAA as requiring that title V permits
programs must provide judicial review to any party who participated on the public comment process and who at a minimum
meets the threshold standing requirements of Article III of the U.S. Constitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison, Section 10.1&hyph;1318(B) of the Code of Virginia extends the right to seek judicial review only to
persons who have suffered an ``actual, threatened, or imminent injury...'' where ``such injury is an invasions of
an immediate, legally protected, pecuniary and substantial interest which is concrete and particularized...''
The Virginia statute, as well Virginia case law does not enable a party who meets the minimum threshold standing requirements
of Article III of the U.S. Constitution access to the Commonwealth's court system. The Commonwealth's Attorney General's
opinion submitted with Virginia's program states that ``the inclusion of the word 'pecuniary' in the amended Virginia
law means the requirement for standing to obtain judicial review may be more stringent than Article III standing requirements,
as the EPA interprets them under the United States Supreme Court decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Defenders of Wildlife

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992) and related cases.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limitations on judicial review in Virginia do not meet the minimum threshold standing requirements of Article
III of the U.S. Constitution and thus do not meet the minimum program approval criteria under title V. Therefore, EPA
is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it does not meet the minimum requirement for standing for judicial
review. Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1318(B) must be amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Default Issuance of Permits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Va. Code section 9&hyph;6.14:3 provides that the purpose of Virginia's Administrative Process Act is to supplement
present and future basic laws. Although Regulations sections 120&hyph;08&hyph;0525 C and E provide for EPA veto
and affected states review, these regulations may be superseded by the Administrative Process Act. Sections 9&hyph;6.14:11
and 9&hyph;6.14:12 of the Administrative Process Act provide that a party may provide written notice to the agency
that a decision on a permit is due, and that the decision is deemed in favor of the named party if no decision is reached
within 30 days. This provision prevents the Commonwealth from meeting the requirement of section 505(b)(3) of the
CAA that no permit be issued unless it is revised to meet the objection of EPA, if EPA objects to the permit within 45 days
after receiving a copy of the proposed permit. This provision also prevents the Commonwealth from meeting &sect;70.8(e),
which requires the Attorney General to certify that no provision of state law requires that a permit be issued after
a certain time if the permitting authority has failed to take action on the application. Virginia must ensure that
no permit will be issued by default through this process until affected states and EPA have had a chance to review the
proposed permit as required by 40 CFR 70.8. In addition Virginia must ensure that no permit will be issued through this
process if EPA has objected within 45 days. EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it does not ensure
that EPA and affected states are given an adequate opportunity for review of proposed permits and that no permit will
be issued if EPA objects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Effectiveness and Enforceability of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Virginia operating permit program Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution (Regulations)
Emergency Rule 8&hyph;5, Federal Operating Permits for Stationary Sources, and Emergency Rule 8&hyph;6, Permit
Program Fees, do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Although the rules are currently effective, they expire
on June 28, 1994 and cannot be implemented or enforced beyond that date. EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's
program because its regulations expire on June 28, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Definitions and Exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of &sect;&sect;70.2 and 70.3 for applicability have not been met. Primarily, Virginia's regulations
at section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0502 and section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0602 do not correctly define major source or stationary
source. Virginia's definitions, and the exemptions of insignificant activities and affected sources found in section
120&hyph;08&hyph;0501 of Virginia's regulations limit the universe of sources that are applicable to Rule 8&hyph;5
by exempting or deferring sources that are required by 40 CFR part 70 to obtain an operating permit. EPA is proposing
to disapprove Virginia's program because the regulations do not apply to the proper universe of sources. Further
discussion of these deficiencies is contained in the Technical Support Document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Variances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Virginia has the authority to issue a variance from requirements imposed by Virginia law. The variance provision
at Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1307.C. empowers the Air Pollution Control Board, after a public hearing, to grant
a local variance from any regulation adopted by the board. EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the program
submitted for approval under 40 CFR part 70, and consequently is proposing to take no action on this provision of Virginia
law. EPA has no authority to approve provisions of state law, such as the variance provision referred to, which are
inconsistent with the CAA. EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty
to comply with a federally enforceable permit, except where such relief is granted through procedures allowed by
40 CFR part 70. EPA reserves the right to enforce the terms of the permit where the permitting authority purports to
grant relief from the duty to comply with a permit in a manner inconsistent with 40 CFR part 70 procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applicable Federal Requirements and Federally Enforceable Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia's submittal does not ensure the Commonwealth's ability to issue permits which include all applicable Federal
requirements and which correctly delineate requirements that are enforceable only by Virginia. The Commonwealth
also cites Virginia's regulations rather than Federal regulations (in the form of federally promulgated regulations
or state regulations that have been approved into the State Implementation Plan) in the definitions in section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0502.
In section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0507, Federal enforceability is incorrectly extended to portions of Virginia's regulations
that have been submitted, but not yet approved, into the State Implementation Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it explicitly purports to extend Federal enforceability
to provisions which are not enforceable by the administrator and also does not include certain provisions which must
be considered federally enforceable (and thus applicable) requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Public Participation and Affected State Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia uses the term ``locality particularly affected'' in determining the geographic scope of notification
to the public of a public comment period on a draft permit. This scope is too narrow and it does not fully meet the requirements
of 40 CFR 70.7(h) for public participation. For full approval, Virginia must ensure that any locality that could potentially
be affected by a permit would be notified of the opportunity for public comment on that permit. In addition, Virginia
incorrectly exempts minor permit modifications from the requirement under &sect;70.8(b)(2) for affected state
review of those modifications. Virginia must also correct this deficiency before EPA can grant full approval to Virginia's
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Permit Fees and Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322.1 and Rule 8&hyph;6 allow for a fee rate of up to $25 per ton, as adjusted by the consumer
price index (CPI), of emissions to be charged to a source. The fee is set by the Air Pollution Control Board and can be
adjusted annually, without exceeding the statutory cap, to meet the costs of implementation of the program. Virginia's
fee revenue projections are based on revenues from a $25 per ton fee, using 1990 as a base year, and adjusted annually
by the CPI, as set out in Section 502 of the CAA. However, no specific fee schedule was included in the submittal and the
cap on the fee amount limits the Board's flexibility in ensuring that revenues are sufficient to cover the direct and
indirect costs of the program. (CAA section 502(b)(3)(A) and Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322. B.) Va. Code section
10.1&hyph;1322. B. precludes the Commonwealth from collecting title V fees to cover the indirect costs charged and
collected by the Commonwealth's Department of Accounts. This provision violates 40 CFR 70.9(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee amounts projected by Virginia in the ``Total Fee Revenue Projections'' table, although sufficient to cover
the estimated costs of the program (as set out in the resource demonstration), do not accurately reflect the mandate
of Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322.1 to adjust fees using the CPI calculation method stipulated in CAA section 502.
Also, it is unclear whether or not the estimated emissions used in the ``Total Fee Revenue Projections'' table include
emissions from acid rain sources, which Virginia exempts from fees in the years 1995 to 1999 (section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0601
C.5.) or includes Hazardous Air Pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for EPA to grant full approval to Virginia's program, the Commonwealth must remove the statutory impediment
to using permit fees to fund certain indirect costs of its program and ensure that the Commonwealth's fee provision
comply with 40 CFR part 70.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Authority and Commitments for Section 112 Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322.A. and Rule 8&hyph;5, Virginia has demonstrated broad legal authority to incorporate
into permits and enforce all applicable CAA section 112 requirements. However, Virginia also indicated that additional
authority may be necessary to conduct specific section 112 activities, and did not commit to implementing CAA section
112(r) for prevention of accidental release. Virginia supplemented its broad legal authority with a commitment
to ``develop the state regulatory provisions as necessary to carry out these programs and the responsibilities under
the delegation after approval of the operating permit program and EPA has issued the prerequisite guidance for development
of these title III programs.'' Also, Virginia has the authority under section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0505 K to require
that an applicant state that the source has complied with CAA section 112(r) or state in the compliance plan that the
source intends to comply and has set a schedule to do so. In the case of CAA section 112(g) requirements, EPA notes that
Virginia must begin to implement this program upon approval of an operating permits program.

2. Authority and Commitments for Implementation of Acid Rain Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia has committed to adopting regulations to meet the requirements of the Acid Rain program by January 1, 1995.
The Attorney General, in his November 5, 1993 opinion, committed to including a statutory and regulatory analysis
of the acid rain portions of the operating permits program in the January 1, 1995 submittal. Virginia has begun its
regulatory development process to adopt regulations for the acid rain portion of the Virginia Operating Permits
Program.

Proposed Action

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to disapprove the operating permits program submitted by the Commonwealth on November 12, 1993.
If promulgated, this disapproval will constitute a disapproval under section 502(d) of the CAA (see generally 57
FR 32253&hyph;32254). As provided under section 502(d)(1) of the CAA, the Commonwealth will have up to 180 days from
the date of EPA's notification of disapproval for the Governor of Virginia to revise and resubmit the program. EPA
is proposing to disapprove this program on the basis that Virginia has not met the following five requirements:

Virginia must amend its program to correct the deficiencies and resubmit all relevant portions of the program, including
a revised Attorney General's opinion. The Technical Support Document discusses Virginia's submittal in detail,
and contains specific references to revisions and modifications necessary to obtain full approval. Submittal of
revised portions of Virginia's operating permit program, including revised statutes and regulations, will undergo
additional notice and comment in the

The Commonwealth of Virginia must submit a corrected program within 180 days following final EPA disapproval of the

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis

assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 502 of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable
to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval
of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not impose any new Federal requirements.

Summary of the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The following is a summary of the Commission's further notice of proposed rulemaking in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;115,
adopted April 20, 1994 and released May 20, 1994. The full texts of all Commission decisions are available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The
complete text of this decision may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Services, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In this Further Notice, the Federal Communications Commission proposes further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. The
rules in part 22 govern the Public Mobile Services. These revisions are proposed in order to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, reduce the processing and review burden
on the Commission's staff, and ensure that licensees in the public mobile services are fully qualified to provide
service to the public as expeditiously as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On May 14, 1992, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the docket 57 FR 29260, July 1, 1992 proposing
comprehensive revisions to part 22. Prior to adoption of a Report and Order in this proceeding, Congress enacted the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) which amends section 3(n) and section 332 of the Communications
Act. The Budget Act creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services, including existing
part 22 common carrier mobile services, private land mobile services, and future services. Because of the broad statutory
changes that affect the regulation of mobile services, action on the part 22 revision was deferred. The proposals
adopted in the further notice augment those proposals adopted in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We propose to require licensees notifying the Commission of minor modifications to their systems on FCC Form 489,
which include Service Area Boundary (SAB) extensions into the adjacent market, to specify whether the 5 year fill-in
period for the market has expired and, if so, to state that the SAB extension does not cover any unserved area. Current
rules allow a cellular licensee to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular service territory pursuant to a written
agreement with the latter licensee. A licensee is permitted to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular geographic
service area (CGSA) at any time and may extend into an adjacent metropolitan service area or a rural service area provided
the 5 year fill-in period has not expired. Many of the contracts included with FCC Forms 489 that notify the Commission
of such minor modifications simply acknowledge a licensee's permission to allow a SAB extension into its market,
even when the 5 year fill-in period has expired. In these cases, the staff must devote a significant amount of time to
determine if the SAB extension covers any unserved area, because licensees may apply to serve such area only by filing
a separate application with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. We propose to revise the scale of the maps required to be filed by the Commission's rules from 1:250,000 to 1:500,000.
We believe that reducing the map scale would serve the public interest by reducing both filing burdens on applicants
as well as review burdens on the staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We propose to modify the rules to allow cellular licensees to make minor changes to their facilities and to add transmitters
within the contours of authorized stations without seeking prior approval or notifying the Commission of such changes.
If we adopt this proposal, we plan to eliminate the listing of internal cell sites on our authorizations for existing
licensees. However, we intend to maintain accurate, current information regarding the cell sites that constitute
a system's CGSA boundary_i.e., the external cell sites. Therefore, we propose to require all cellular licenses to
submit the following information for each of their external cell sites: (1) The geographic coordinates and cell site
location description as required in Item 27 on Schedule B of FCC Form 401 and (2) the operating and technical parameters
for the cell site which is currently required in Table MOB 2 and Table MOB 3 of FCC Form 401. This is a one time filing that
would assist the staff in updating the Commission's database systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We propose to modify the information that licensees must submit pursuant to rule &sect;22.925 of the Commission's
rules. First, consistent with the proposal to revise the map scale, we propose to revise the scale of the full-size
map to a scale of 1:500,000. Second, we propose to require that all maps submitted pursuant to this rule show only the
exterior cell sites and their respective service area boundaries that make up the CGSA. Third, we propose to require
licensees to include an exhibit providing the coordinates for each exterior cell site and the information currently
required in the MOB 3 Table of FCC Form 401. Fourth, we propose to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit a
frequency utilization plan or chart. Fifth, we propose to require licensees to label all System Information Update
maps with specific language explaining which carrier is filing the map and for which market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
7. We propose that for all 931 MHz paging applications, applicants must specify the frequency for which they seek authorization.
The frequency requested must be available at the time the application is filed. Applications that are acceptable
for filing will be placed on public notice. Mutually exclusive applications received within 30 days after the public
notice will be considered one processing group. Mutually exclusive applicants for specific frequencies that are
accepted for filing after July 26, 1993 would be subject to the competitive bidding process. We also propose that applicants
for 931 MHz paging frequencies with applications pending when final rules become effective be given 60 days from the
effective date of a final order in this proceeding to amend their applications to specify frequencies for which they
seek authorization. Failure to amend a pending application to specify a frequency will result in dismissal of that
application. All pending amended applications and newly filed applications that are mutually exclusive and received
within 60 days of the effective date of this Order will be considered together as a processing group this one time only.
We propose that the amended applications be subject to the competitive bidding process. However, we seek comment
on whether we should instead use lotteries for these applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. We propose to consider the following to be an initial 931 MHz paging application: (1) an application anywhere on
a new frequency and (2) a proposal to locate a new facility more than two kilometers (1.6 miles) from any existing facility
operating on the same frequency. A 931 MHz paging application would be considered a modification of an existing system
only if: (1) It proposes a new location two kilometers or less from a previously authorized and fully operational base
station licensed to the same licensee operating on the same frequency; or (2) the application is for a change of location
within two kilometers of an existing station licensed to the same licensee; or (3) the application proposes a technical
change that would not increase the service contour. We tentatively conclude that we will use first come, first served
procedures to process 931 MHz paging modification licenses in cases in which we conclude, as a result of our examination
of the issue in this rulemaking proceeding, that the use of competitive bidding procedures would not be legally permissible
or otherwise appropriate. Under the first come, first served procedure, only manually exclusive modification applications
received on the same day would, consistent with the Budget Act, be designated for comparative hearing to determine
which modification application should be granted.

9. We welcome comment on any and all of the proposed further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. We also invite suggestions for

 The further notice of proposed rulemaking solicits public comment to revise part 22 of FCC's rules governing the Public
Mobile Services. The revisions are proposed in order to make the rules easier to understand, eliminate outdated rules
and unnecessary information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, and allow licensees greater
flexibility in providing service to the public. Generally, the collected information is used to determine the legal
and technical qualifications of the respondents.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Commission's initial regulatory flexibility analysis follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing to revise title 47, part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements and, whenever possible, provide greater flexibility to carriers while at
the same time promoting the public interest. The objective of this proposal is to provide effective and adaptive regulation
for communications.

The proposed rules would not significantly change the existing reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements.
In the case of required map filings, for example, the proposal merely changes the scale of the map filed. Several new
requirements are proposed. For example, one of the proposed new rules would require that cellular licensees submit
information for each of their external cell sites. Another proposed rule would require that applicants for 931 MHz
paging service request specific frequencies in their applications.

There are approximately 8,600 licensees subject to the rules in part 22. A substantial portion of these are small entities.
There are also a number of small entities whose business is consulting or providing other services in connection with
part 22. The proposed further notice would not significantly impact these small entities.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule originated based on a recommendation in the General Accounting Office (GAO) report dated October
30, 1991, entitled ``Economy and Efficiency Audits Can Help Reduce Overhead Costs,'' which recommends that regulations
be revised to provide guidance for the use of overhead should-cost reviews. The proposed rule modifies DFARS 215.810
to supplement the FAR rule published for public comment on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16388). It provides specific criteria
for when DoD activities should consider performing should-cost reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because contracts awarded to small entities normally are not subject to program or overhead should-cost reviews.
An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small
businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will
also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS
Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval
of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

 NMFS announces that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 31 to the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and Amendment
35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) for Secretarial review and is requesting comments from the public.
These amendments would implement the Modified Block proposal, an action intended to discourage excessive consolidation
in the Pacific halibut and sablefish individual fishing quota (IFQ) program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon reviewing the plan or amendment, must immediately publish a notice that the plan or amendment is available for
public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in
determining whether to approve the plan or amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments 31 and 35 to the respective FMPs would implement the Modified Block proposal to the Pacific halibut and
sablefish IFQ program. These amendments would authorize the issuance of quota share (QS) blocks for QS that would
have resulted in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ based on the 1994 total allowable catch for fixed gear in the halibut
and sablefish fisheries, allow the combination of QS blocks that are less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut and
less than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish, and restrict the amount of blocks that may be held in any one IFQ regulatory
area. These amendments are intended to prevent excessive consolidation of the Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries
off Alaska, and are consistent with the management objectives of the Magnuson Act and the Northern Pacific Halibut
Act.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative
final monograph that would establish conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) topical health-care antiseptic
drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed
rulemaking to amend the previous notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210) after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative
record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness
of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug
products conducted by FDA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), FDA published, under &sect;330.10(a)(7), a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish
a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, based on the recommendations of the Antimicrobial I Panel
and the agency's response to comments submitted following publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
Interested persons were invited to submit objections or requests for oral hearing by February 6, 1978. In response
to numerous requests to extend the time period for submitting objections or requests for oral hearing, the agency
issued a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 3, 1978 (43 FR 4637) granting an extension of the deadline to March 6, 1978. During this time period, the
agency received 6 petitions that requested reopening the administrative record and 11 requests for an oral hearing.
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1979 (44 FR 13041), the agency deferred action on the requests for a hearing, but granted the petitions to
reopen the record to allow interested persons to submit comments and any new or additional data by June 7, 1979, and
reply comments by July 9, 1979. FDA also stated its intent to publish an updated (amended) tentative final monograph
based on the review and evaluation of new submissions and a reevaluation of existing data.

the results of testing to FDA as expeditiously as possible prior to establishment of a final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the June 7, 1979, closing date for the submission of new data, and prior to the October 26, 1979, reopening

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 21, 1980 (45 FR 18398), the agency advised that it had reopened the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial
drug products to allow for consideration of data and information that had been filed in the Dockets Management Branch
after the date the administrative record on the tentative final monograph had officially closed on March 6, 1978.
The agency concluded that any new data and information filed prior to March 21, 1980, should be available to the agency
in developing a proposed regulation in the form of a tentative final monograph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panels were put on public display
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. In
response to the previous tentative final monograph and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for mercury-containing
drug products and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug products, 4 drug manufacturers' associations,
44 drug manufacturers, 1 medical device manufacturer, 1 drug distributor, 2 medical schools, 2 research laboratories,
1 law firm, and 1 consulting firm submitted comments. Copies of the comments received are also on public display in
the Dockets Management Branch.

The advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 13, 1974 (39 FR 33103), was designated as a ``proposed monograph'' in order to conform to terminology
used in the OTC drug review regulations (&sect;330.10). Similarly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, which was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), was designated as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The present document is also designated
as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The legal status of each tentative final monograph, however, is that of a proposed
rule. The present document is a reproposal regarding health-care antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This antimicrobial rulemaking is broad in scope, encompassing products that may contain the same active ingredients,
but are labeled and marketed for different intended uses. For example, one group of products is primarily used by consumers
for ``first aid'' and includes skin antiseptics, skin wound cleansers, and skin wound protectants. Another group
of products, antiseptic handwashes, are used by consumers on a more frequent, even daily, basis and includes products
for personal use in the home, such as when caring for invalids and during family illness. A third group of products is
generally intended for use by health professionals and includes health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative
skin preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite the completion of the first aid section of the antimicrobial monograph, the agency published
a separate tentative final monograph for these products in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). The non-first aid uses of topical antimicrobials, now identified as ``health-care
antiseptics,'' are addressed in this document. Although the amended tentative final monographs for first-aid antiseptics
and health-care antiseptics are being published separately, both categories will eventually be included under
part 333 (21 CFR part 333).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also has decided that OTC topical antimicrobial and topical antibiotic drug products should be included
within the same monograph. Although an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical
antibiotic drug products was published under part 342 (21 CFR part 342) on April 1, 1977 (42 FR 17642), the final monograph
for those products was issued on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47312) as a new subpart of the OTC topical antimicrobial monograph,
part 333, subpart B_Topical First Aid Antibiotic Drug Products. Subpart A will cover first aid antiseptic drug products;
subpart C will cover antifungal drug products; subpart D covers acne drug products; and new subpart E will cover health-care
antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish subpart E of part 333, FDA states its position on the
establishment of a monograph for OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. This document addresses only those comments
and data concerning the previous antimicrobial tentative final monograph that are related to ``non-first aid uses,''
including products for personal use in the home and products used by health-care professionals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal constitutes FDA's reevaluation of the January 6, 1978 tentative final monograph based on the comments
received and the agency's independent evaluation of the Miscellaneous External Panel's reports on OTC alcohol and
mercury-containing drug products and the comments received. The following sections of the January 6, 1978 tentative
final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products are being addressed in this document: &sect;&sect;333.1,
333.3, 333.30, 333.50, 333.85, 333.87, 333.97, and 333.99. The following sections of the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking for alcohol drug products are being addressed in this document: &sect;&sect;333.55 and 333.98. Modifications
have been made for clarity and regulatory accuracy and to reflect new information. Such new information has been placed
on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). These modifications are reflected in the following summary
of the comments and FDA's responses to them. (See section I.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness
issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing
or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.
Accordingly, FDA does not use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded),
``Category II'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available
data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage.
In place of Category I, the term ``monograph conditions'' is used; in place of Categories II and III, the term ``nonmonograph
conditions'' is used. This document retains the concepts of Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph
stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to this monograph would be generally
recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12 months after the
date of publication of the final monograph in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On or after that date, no OTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,
i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded,
may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject
of an approved application or abbreviated application (hereinafter called application). Further, any OTC drug
product subject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the monograph must be
in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered
for introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the monograph
at the earliest possible date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products (39 FR 33103), the agency
suggested that the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective 30 days after the date of publication
of the final monograph in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that the conditions excluded from the monograph (Category II) be eliminated from OTC drug products effective
6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph, regardless of whether further testing was undertaken
to justify their future use. Experience has shown that relabeling of products covered by the monograph is necessary
in order for manufacturers to comply with the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have to be written,
ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturing process. The agency has determined that it is impractical
to expect new labeling to be in effect 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph. Experience has shown
also that if the deadline for relabeling is too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and related paperwork.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the monograph. Reformulation often involves the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to do stability testing on the new product. An accelerated aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process may be used to test a new formulation; however, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability testing is not successful, and if further reformulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required, there could be a further delay in having a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product available for manufacture. The agency wishes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a reasonable period of time for relabeling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace that could not only result in economic loss, but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with consumers' access to safe and effective drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Therefore, the agency is proposing that the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 12 months after the date of publication most manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can order new labeling and reformulate their products and have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them in compliance in the marketplace. If the agency determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any labeling for a condition included in the final monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effective date, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC drug products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Two comments contended that OTC drug monographs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretive, as opposed to substantive, regulations. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment referred to statements on this issue submitted earlier to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the preamble to the procedures for classification of OTC drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 11, 1972 (37 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 9464 at 9471 to 9472), and in paragraph 3 of the preamble to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tentative final monograph for OTC antacid drug products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31260). FDA reaffirms the conclusions stated in those documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Court decisions have confirmed the agency's authority to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantive regulations by rulemaking. (See, e.g.,

637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One comment pointed out that under ``Subpart B_Active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ingredients'' of the tentative final monograph, no CFR part number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was assigned to the category ``skin antiseptic.'' However, part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers were assigned to other categories without any Category I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients, with the term ``reserved'' in parentheses. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment requested that this omission be corrected in the amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The omission pointed out by the comment was an oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is no longer necessary to assign a CFR part number to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the category ``skin antiseptic,'' because skin antiseptics have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been included in broader categories identified as first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics in the amended tentative final monograph for first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644) and as health-care antiseptics in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this tentative final monograph. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All Category I first aid antiseptic and health-care antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
active ingredients have been listed in the amended tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph under subpart A and subpart E, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General Comments on Antimicrobials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. A number of comments objected to the Panel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation for separate statements of identity in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of products containing the same antimicrobial active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. As an example, several comments noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine has several professional uses (health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash, skin antiseptic, and surgical hand scrub) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing a product in conformance with two or more product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories becomes difficult because there are different labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for each drug product category. Some comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested FDA to combine the drug product category designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to add a new multipurpose product category that allows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combining of labeling indications now included in several product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories. One comment specifically recommended that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider changing product class designations and/or adding a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product class ``Multi Purpose Skin Prep'' or ``Skin Prep,'' with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indications for use including those listed under &sect;333.85 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(health-care personnel hand wash), &sect;333.87 (patient preoperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin preparation), &sect;333.90 (skin antiseptic), and &sect;333.97 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(surgical hand scrub). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that the word ``skin'' was superfluous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because all OTC antiseptics are intended only for use on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin; still another comment contended that the statement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity ``antiseptic'' is preferable to ``skin antiseptic'' because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products are used on cuts, scratches, and mucous membranes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as skin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reopening of the administrative record for alcohol drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for topical antimicrobial OTC use published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 21, 1982 (47 FR 22324), one comment objected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statement of identity in proposed &sect;333.98(a) which read, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``alcohol for topical antimicrobial use,'' (47 FR 22324 at 22332). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment stated that this term would be confusing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer and suggested the term ``antiseptic for the skin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that OTC topical antimicrobial drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products need not have multiple statements of identity. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the statements of identity recommended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33103), i.e., health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub, and the statement of identity recommended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 22324), i.e., alcohol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial use, the agency has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general term ``antiseptic'' broadly describes all proposed product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories and reflects the basic intended uses of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The agency believes that the statement of identity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``multiple purpose skin prep'' or ``skin prep'' recommended by one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment would not as clearly and succinctly describe the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products as the statement of identity ``antiseptic.'' As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in section I.B., comment 5, the agency is also proposing an additional term ``antiseptic handwash'' as
a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of identity to describe products for home use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the first aid antiseptic segment of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the term ``skin'' has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleted from the previously proposed statement of identity ``skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic.'' Although several comments felt that the word ``skin'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was superfluous, the agency has no objection to the statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``antiseptic for the skin'' or ``skin antiseptic'' appearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere in the labeling of these products as additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the consumer or health-care professional, provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it does not appear in any portion of the labeling required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph and does not detract from such required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See section I.I., comment 19.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the first aid antiseptic segment of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the agency believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term ``antiseptic'' is readily understood by consumers. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also finds this to be true for health professionals. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is therefore proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of identity for all OTC topical antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients included in this tentative final monograph. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing that manufacturers may have an option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an alternate statement of identity describing only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific intended use(s) of the product. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing that the statement of identity for antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products in &sect;333.450(a) read as follows: ``The labeling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single-use product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product as an `antiseptic'
and/or with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate statement of identity described in &sect;&sect;333.455(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
333.460(a), or 333.465(a). The labeling of a multiple-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may use the single statement of identity `antiseptic' and/or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate statements of identity described in &sect;&sect;333.455(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
333.460(a), and 333.465(a). When `antiseptic' is used as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, the intended use(s), such as patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, is to be included under the indications. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple-use products, a statement of the intended use should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also precede the specific directions for each use.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the proposed labeling for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple-use products is flexible and provides manufacturers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a number of options. However, the agency recognizes that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers may wish to label their antiseptic drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all of the allowable indications for a particular active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient and that this may give rise to difficulties in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating all of the information on a product's various uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the limited space on an OTC label. The agency wishes to point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out that some portions of the proposed indications are optional, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., the examples included in both the antiseptic and health-care personnel handwash indications, and need not
be incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the labeling at all. In addition, manufacturers are free to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design ways of incorporating all the information on the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses of their drug product through the use of flap labels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesigned packages, or package inserts.

The agency is providing several examples of labeling for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic product containing povidone-iodine when labeled as a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. One comment requested that scrubbing devices such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brushes or sponges that are impregnated with approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial ingredients be included in the monograph. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment requested clarification of the agency's views on trays or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kits that contain povidone-iodine and disposable instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(scissors, forceps, and hemostats) packed in a sterile package, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are designed to reduce the incidence of cross-infection in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative final monograph does not provide for the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of devices such as brushes or sponges impregnated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobials, or of trays or kits that contain povidone-iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and disposable instruments, because the monograph is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate only OTC drug active ingredients. Since these comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were submitted, the agency has established procedures (see 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 3) describing how it determines which agency component has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products comprised of any combination of a drug and a device. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, interested parties are encouraged to read the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document (Ref. 1) for guidance: ``Intercenter Agreement Between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Devices and Radiological Health.'' (See &sect;3.5 (21 CFR 3.5).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This agreement is on file in the Dockets Management Branch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(address above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment expressed concern that the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph failed to provide consumers with an antibacterial skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanser for home use. The comment noted that, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional health care personnel, many consumers have a need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cleansing products containing antibacterial agents for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of promoting good individual and family hygiene. Uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such products include the following: (1) To reduce bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the hands and face to a greater extent than can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished with ordinary soap, and to prevent accumulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria from potential sources of contamination. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples were cited: Cleansing oneself after changing a baby's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diaper, or after assisting aged or ill members of the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with their toilet needs, and before preparing a family meal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The added benefit of an antibacterial cleanser for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minute cuts and abrasions from shaving and other minor traumas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The need for an antibacterial cleanser other than bar soap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on local parts of the body such as the face because soap (alkali 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salts of fatty acids) can be irritating or too drying for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals' needs. The comment recommended a new product class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under proposed &sect;333.90(a) (skin antiseptic) to be identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Antimicrobial (or Antibacterial) Personal Cleanser'' with claims such as ``decreases bacteria on the skin''
and ``contains an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibacterial agent.'' The comment also suggested that the 10-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum use limitation would not be appropriate for this product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class, but use could be restricted to 5 or 10 times daily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment recommended that antimicrobial soaps be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to make claims relating to general health care and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal hygiene similar to the claims allowed for health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwashes. The comment stated that an antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soap will reduce bacteria or the transfer of potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenic micro-organisms in the home and, therefore, serves as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a preventive health care aid in controlling diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third comment requested the addition of a fourth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication for alcohol active ingredients in proposed &sect;333.98(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow use as an antibacterial handwash to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-contamination from one individual to another. The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that products containing alcohols are often used as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwashes by athletic trainers to help prevent the spread of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin infections from one individual to another in situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which soap and water are not available, e.g., on the playing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth comment asserted that numerous other meaningful and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
truthful indications can be used which enhance the safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective use of a health-care personnel handwash. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terms ``microbicidal cleanser'' or ``antiseptic germicidal skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanser'' are appropriate and meaningful terminology describing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this use indication.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency agrees that antibacterial or antiseptic personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanser products are practical for home use, to help prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross contamination from one person to another, especially after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diaper changing and caring for invalids or ill family members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also agrees with one comment that claims relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general health-care and personal hygiene similar to the claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed for health-care personnel handwashes may be suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because such claims explain the uses of these products in lay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency separated the first aid antiseptic uses of OTC topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial drug products from the ``non-first aid uses.'' In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that document, the agency proposed that the following terms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories be deleted: skin antiseptics, skin wound protectants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and skin wound cleansers; and the agency proposed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate labeling, instead, be included in a new category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called ``first aid antiseptics'' (56 FR 33644 at 33649). Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses proposed by one comment, i.e., ``minute cuts and abrasions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from shaving and other minor traumas,'' are considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing ``first aid uses'' and are adequately covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling provided for ``first aid antiseptics'' in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.50(b) (56 FR 33677), which contains the following: ``First 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid to help'' (select one of the following: ``prevent,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(``decrease'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), (``reduce'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), ``guard
against,'' or ``protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against'') (select one of the following: ``infection,'' ``bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination,'' or ``skin infection'') ``in minor cuts, scrapes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burns.'' The agency believes that the first aid indication is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently broad to cover minute cuts and abrasions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shaving and that it is not necessary to include the words ``other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor traumas'' in the indications statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the first aid uses described in the first comment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency recognizes a need for an OTC ``antiseptic handwash'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product for repeated or daily use over an extended period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for some of the other uses described by the comment. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees with the comments that health-care personnel handwashes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate for such use because submitted data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness studies, for uses subject to this rulemaking, were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from handwashing tests similar to or the same as tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the agency's previously proposed testing guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see 43 FR 1210 at 1240), i.e., ``Modified Cade Procedure,'' ``Glove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Juice Test,'' and ``Test for Health-Care Personnel Handwash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effectiveness.'' The agency is proposing in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph in &sect;333.455(a) that a health-care personnel handwash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can also bear a statement of identity of ``antiseptic handwash.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See section I.B., comment 3.) For products labeled for multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses including both antiseptic handwash and first aid labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, the general statement of identity would be ``antiseptic'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in section I.B., comment 3. The product would then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to incorporate the monograph labeling for both antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash as well as first aid antiseptic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``cleanser'' included in claims requested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments is not appropriate in this rulemaking because it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be a cosmetic claim in view of the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) defines a cosmetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``articles intended to be *&blank;*&blank;* applied to the human body *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cleansing *&blank;*&blank;*'' (21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1)) and thus may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading to consumers. As discussed in section I.I., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19, the terms ``microbicidal'' and ``germicidal'' may appear in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of OTC antiseptic drug products under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency is proposing as the indication for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products bearing the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a general claim similar to one recommended by one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, i.e., ``for handwashing to decrease bacteria on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin.'' The agency has determined that this claim may, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's option, be followed by one or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following examples: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or treatment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Descriptive statements such as ``contains antibacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients'' and ``for the purpose of promoting good individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and family hygiene'' are considered to be examples of statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not significantly related to the safe and effective use of the product and thus are outside the scope of the rulemaking.
Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements may be included in the labeling of these OTC drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products subject to the statutory provisions against false or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that the indication proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic handwash drug products is also appropriate for health-care personnel handwashes and is also proposing
the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication for health-care personnel handwashes. ``For handwashing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical care or treatment.'') In addition to the indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed above, the agency is proposing that health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwashes may also bear the following indication: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease.'' The agency is proposing the statement ``recommended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated use'' as an ``other allowable indication'' for antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or health-care personnel handwash drug products (see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency sees no reason to continue to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``antimicrobial soap'' as a separate product category. Soap is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be a dosage form, and specific dosage forms are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being included in the monograph unless there is a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety or efficacy reason for doing so. Antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients may be formulated as soaps for some of the uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in this document, e.g., handwash; however, the designation ``antimicrobial soap'' is no longer being
proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in the monograph. In addition, the agency considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other product categories that are being proposed to be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informative to the users of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the comments, the agency is proposing labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for professional or consumer uses as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

variety of uses for promoting good individual and family hygiene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency tentatively concludes that the labeling statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed above express the same concepts as the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested by the comments in language that can be more readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understood by the consumer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. One comment objected to a portion of the definition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash in &sect;333.3(d) of the tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph that states that the antimicrobial agent is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``broad-spectrum'' and ``if possible, persistent.'' The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that, because these handwashes are used 50 to 100 times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily, persistence of effect is unnecessary. The comment also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned the need for a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, stating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus epidermidis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. epidermidis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) generally is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only natural resident bacteria on the skin, and other transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms are more likely to be removed mechanically by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing than by antimicrobial action. The comment suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the choice to use or not to use a broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient should be left to the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment pointed out that the requirement for ``broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrum'' activity is inconsistently applied in the definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, and surgical hand scrub (&sect;333.3(d), (e), and (i), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively) because ``broad spectrum'' activity is mandatory for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first two classes and only ``desirable'' for surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrubs. The comment cited comment 93 (43 FR 1210 at 1224) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness of OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobials (43 FR 1239) to show the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awareness of possible shifts in microbial flora due to a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad spectrum activity. The comment urged that all three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product classes include the requirement for each product to at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least demonstrate in vitro ``cidal'' activity against gram-negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria, fungi, and lipophilic and hydrophilic viruses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the gram-positive activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;333.3(d) of the previous tentative final monograph, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash was defined as an ``*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial-containing preparation designed for frequent use; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it reduces the number of transient micro-organisms on intact skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an initial baseline level after adequate washing, rinsing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying, and it is broad-spectrum, fast acting, and, if possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persistent.'' In the tentative final monograph, the agency agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Panel that persistence, defined as prolonged activity, is a valuable attribute that assures antimicrobial
activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the interval between washings and is important to a safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and effective health-care personnel handwash (43 FR 1215). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel explained that a property such as persistence, which acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent the growth or establishment of transient micro-organisms as part of the normal baseline or resident flora,
would be an added benefit (39 FR 33103 at 33115). Although the Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not propose persistence as a mandatory requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, the agency is retaining the words 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``if possible, persistent'' in the definition in this amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph because this is a desirable trait for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment's objection to the broad-spectrum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, the Panel in its discussion of the normal skin flora 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the predominant members of the normal flora are gram 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive cocci and diptheroids and not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. epidermidis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment indicates. The Panel stated further that a small number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gram negative species, such as coliforms and related micro-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms, as well as higher forms such as yeast may also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents of the skin of healthy individuals (39 FR 33103 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33107). In its discussion of health-care personnel handwash drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, the Panel acknowledged that, in all likelihood, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified effect of these products (i.e., removal of transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms) can be achieved with a well formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonantimicrobial soap or detergent product. However, the Panel concluded that transient micro-organisms may become
part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established ``resident'' flora with time, and stated that in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care situation, the fast, effective removal of transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms is a requirement because they may be pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(39 FR 33103 at 33115). The Panel recommended that health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash drug products containing an antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient should be broad spectrum. The Panel defined ``broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrum'' in reference to microbiological activity as meaning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial has activity against more than one type of micro-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism, that is, activity against gram positive and gram 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses (39 FR 33115). Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient micro-organisms present on the skin may include widely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse species, resulting from contact with contaminated persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and materials, the agency concludes that a greater reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient micro-organisms on the skin can be achieved if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial containing drug product used as a health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash provides broad spectrum activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, because the principal intended use of these professional use products is the prevention of nosocomial
(hospital acquired) infections, the agency believes that these drug products should have demonstrable antimicrobial
activity against a microbial spectrum that includes the micro-organisms associated with these infections. As discussed
in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing, in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) of the testing requirements, a
list of micro-organisms that reflects a spectrum of antimicrobial activity pertinent to the intended use of these
drug products and against which the products must be tested. The agency is proposing the following definition of broad
spectrum activity in &sect;333.403(b) of this amended tentative final monograph: ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broad spectrum activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro
activity against the micro-organisms listed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory
concentration determinations conducted according to methodology in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii).'' This methodology
has been developed by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Although micro-organisms
in addition to those listed may also be used for testing, the agency will use the test micro-organisms identified in
&sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) for any necessary compliance testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wants to emphasize that in this amended tentative final monograph the broad-spectrum criterion applies
to final-formulated drug products used as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative
skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. Although the Category I active ingredients currently included in this
amended tentative final monograph are broad spectrum independent of formulation, some Category III antiseptic
ingredients have limited spectra (activity against only gram positive bacteria; for example, chloroxylenol (see
section I.G., comment 12) and triclosan (see section I.L., comment 23)), but when properly formulated in a final product
the spectrum can be broadened to include additional activity against the test micro-organisms, thereby possibly
enabling these ingredients to become Category I. Although the agency agrees with the first comment that the manufacturer
may use or not use a broad-spectrum ingredient in a particular health-care antiseptic drug product, the finished
product must demonstrate in vitro activity against the specific micro-organisms listed in proposed &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the second comment, that broad spectrum was inconsistently applied in the definitions of the three
product classes, the agency has reevaluated the issue and believes that all product classes should be broad spectrum.
As stated in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1212), maintaining the balance among species of micro-organisms
constituting the normal skin flora is more likely to be threatened by use of antimicrobial products with a limited
spectrum. Also much of the data concerning the spread of infections in hospitals indicates that the use of an antimicrobial
with broad spectrum activity would help prevent this (see section I.D., comment 9). Based on the reasons mentioned
above, the agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included
in this tentative final monograph.

7. Several comments contended that FDA does not have the authority to restrict OTC labeling claims to exact wording,
to the exclusion of what the comments described as other ``equally truthful claims for the products.'' One comment
pointed out that numerous other meaningful and truthful statements will provide useful information and will enhance
the safe and effective use of these products. Several comments maintained that manufacturers have a constitutional
right to use any truthful, nonmisleading labeling under the first amendment. To support their position, the comments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications
for use of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labeling of OTC drug products are required to contain
in a prominent and conspicuous location, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use established under
an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing
such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling, which shall
neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVED USES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on
indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternative language describing
indications for use that is not false or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug
labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity, warnings, and directions) must
appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language
has been established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63 or 330.1(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the previous tentative final monograph, supplemental language relating to indications had been proposed and
captioned as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;&sect;333.85, 333.87 and 333.97. Under FDA's revised labeling policy (51 FR 16258), such statements are
included at the tentative final stage as examples of other truthful and nonmisleading language that would be allowed
elsewhere in the labeling. In accordance with the revised labeling policy, such statements would not be included
in a final monograph.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing this amended tentative final monograph, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency has reevaluated these ``other allowable statements'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether they should be incorporated, wherever possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the indications developed under the monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in &sect;333.85 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health-care personnel handwash, in &sect;333.87 for patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, and in &sect;333.97 for surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub. The statement ``recommended for repeated use'' proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a health-care personnel handwash has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph as an ``other allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication'' in proposed &sect;333.455 for antiseptic handwash or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash drug products. (See section I.B., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``broad spectrum'' and ``fast-acting'' (if applicable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were proposed as ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' for all three of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these product classes in the previous tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section I.C., comment 6, the agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definition of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product classes included in this amended tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. Although the term ``broad spectrum'' is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of these product classes, the agency does not see a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to include this information in the ``indications'' for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Likewise, the term ``fast-acting'' is included in the definitions of these product classes, but the agency
does not see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a need to include this information in the indications for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. This type of information may appear elsewhere in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of these products as additional information to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care professional, provided it does not appear in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the labeling required by the monograph and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detract from such required information. Other previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' i.e., ``contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient(s),'' and ``nonirritating,'' are not related in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant way to the safe and effective use of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not believe that statements such as ``contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibacterial ingredient(s)'' or ``contains antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient(s)'' are necessary on products intended primarily for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals, but has no objection to such statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearing in the labeling as other information not intertwined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any portion of the labeling required by the monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the term ``nonirritating'' may appear as additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the health-care professional, provided it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear in any portion of the labeling required by the monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and does not detract from such required information. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such statements are subject to the provisions of section 502 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading. Such statements will be evaluated on a product-by- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product basis, under the provisions of section 502 of the act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to labeling that is false or misleading.

8. Several comments requested that certain warnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in the labeling of OTC drug products marketed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public should not be required on such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed only to health professionals and labeled primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use in health-care facilities as in proposed &sect;333.99 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Professional labeling'' (43 FR 1210 at 1248 and 1249). Examples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited were the cautionary statements for ``skin antiseptic'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``skin wound protectant'' in proposed &sect;&sect;333.90(c)(3) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
333.93(c)(3) ``Do not use this product for more than 10 days. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the infection (condition) worsens or persists, see your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician,'' and for ``skin wound protectant'' in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.93(c)(7) ``Do not use on chronic skin conditions such as leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema.'' The comments stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the professional use of these products sometimes differs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer use and that products which are marketed only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care institutions and are dispensed and administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals should only contain warnings that apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use. One comment concluded that requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional labeling to contain a caution such as in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.93(c)(7) could possibly subject the health-care facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the physician to unwarranted product liability claims, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the particular use of the product under medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision is entirely justified and necessary for proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the patient. One of the comments stated that flexibility should be provided so that manufacturers can

 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency published the tentative final monograph for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antacid drug products, in which the concept of ethical labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for OTC drug products was first discussed in comment 56 at 38 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31264. There, the agency stated that the warning statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearing on OTC drug products should be included in ethical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(professional) labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, in the previous tentative final monograph for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), the agency proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.99 (``Professional labeling'') which stated that the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of products (covered by the monograph) that is provided only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals and the labeling for those products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily used in health-care facilities shall include all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warnings required in each subsection of the monograph, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those in &sect;333.90 for ``skin antiseptic'' or &sect;333.93 for ``skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wound protectant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the first aid antiseptic segment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial drug products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency has proposed deletion of the categories cited by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, i.e., ``skin antiseptic'' and ``skin wound protectant,'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate drug categories and included them in a single drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product category identified as ``first aid antiseptic.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cautionary statements referred to by the comments are addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this document, the agency is addressing the uses other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than first-aid, i.e., health-care antiseptic uses, of topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial drug products. These products may contain the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic active ingredient(s) as the first aid antiseptic drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, but they are labeled and marketed for different uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cautionary statements previously proposed in &sect;&sect;333.90(c)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 333.93(c)(3) addressed short-term first aid uses of products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily proposed as ``consumer products.'' These products were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not principally intended to be marketed for hospital or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use. Therefore, the agency agrees with the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such cautionary statements do not apply to professional use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of antiseptic drug products and need not appear in the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of antiseptic products marketed as antiseptic handwashes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. Likewise the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that health-care antiseptic drug products, marketed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principally to health-care professionals, do not need to bear a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cautionary statement not to use the product on chronic skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions such as leg ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema. As the comment pointed out, professional use of these products
is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different than consumer use and, in some instances, use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product on the above-mentioned skin conditions under medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision may be justified and necessary for proper treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the patient. Therefore, this cautionary statement is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being included in this tentative final monograph.

This tentative final monograph addresses specifically the use of these topical antiseptic drug products by health-care
professionals and in health-care facilities. The labeling proposed for those products in this document represents
that labeling which the agency believes health-care professionals need to properly use these products. Therefore,
the agency believes that the warnings proposed in &sect;333.450(c) of this tentative final monograph should appear
in the labeling of these products that are directed to health-care professionals and health-care facilities, even
if the product is marketed principally to these sources only. However, the agency believes that one of these warnings
can be modified if the product is labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In such cases, the second sentence
of the warning proposed in &sect;333.450(c)(3), regarding consulting a doctor, can be deleted. This concept is being
included in this tentative final monograph. (See &sect;333.450(d).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In responding to the comments regarding the warnings in the ``Professional labeling'' section (&sect;333.99) of
the previous tentative final monograph, the agency has determined that these warnings are no longer necessary. Accordingly,
&sect;333.99 is not being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See section I.D., comment 9 for discussion
of &sect;333.99(a), and section I.J., comment 21 for discussion of &sect;333.99(b). Also, see section II.B., paragraph
14 in the first aid antiseptic segment of this tentative final monograph (56 FR 33644 at 33675) for discussion of &sect;333.99(c).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Several comments made recommendations regarding the requirement that professional labeling for all classes
of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products must contain the caution statement in proposed &sect;333.99(a), ``Caution:
Overuse of this and other antimicrobial products may result in an overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms,
particularly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' Some of the comments stated that this caution statement should be required only for antimicrobials where there
is valid scientific evidence to show that such caution is appropriate, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds
and triclosan, which have been associated with the overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms, specifically

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Three comments contended that reports of contamination of benzalkonium chloride solutions with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enterobacteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species were basically the result of misuse, improper storage and dilution, poor technique, and contamination with
neutralizing chemicals. One comment recommended that the proposed caution statement in &sect;333.99(a) should
be changed to read: ``Improper use or overuse *&blank;*&blank;*.'' and cited the discussion of the proposed warning
for quaternary ammonium compounds by the agency at 43 FR 1237 where the phrase ``misuse or overuse'' was included.
Another comment objected to the caution, arguing that it is based on theoretical considerations only and there is
no published clinical evidence implicating quaternary ammonium compounds. Still another comment stated that its
quaternary ammonium compound product passed the commonly used test for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In defense of triclosan's implication in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 overgrowth, one comment argued that overgrowth was just an unproven hypothesis and submitted the ``Summary for Basis
of Approval'' from an approved new drug application (NDA) for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) which included data
on a skin flora study that indicated an increasing, continuous gram-negative growth only in the axillary area over
a 6-month period, even though chlorhexidine is active against gram-negative micro-organisms. The comment referred
to FDA's Division of Anti-Infective Drug Products as having recognized that gram-negative overgrowth can be adequately
controlled by restricting use to indications provided in the labeling of a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments pointed out that data on povidone-iodine have proven broad spectrum effectiveness, referring
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendation (Ref. 2) for using this ingredient for skin
preparation before intravenous catheter insertion and other procedures to reduce infection. The comments also
noted that in a study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3), in which 20 transfers of 7 gram-negative micro-organisms (including

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
aeruginosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) were made, the minimum inhibitory concentration did not change, supporting the fact that repeated use of povidone-iodine
would not result in resistant micro-organisms. For these reasons, these comments recommended that &sect;333.99(a)
should be revised to exclude povidone-iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a thorough review and evaluation of the available data, the agency concludes that the professional labeling
caution that overuse of an antimicrobial drug product may cause an overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms
is not necessary. In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1212), the agency stated its awareness of
the theory that gram-negative bacteria will replace gram-positive bacteria that are reduced in number or eliminated
by use of antimicrobials and encouraged research to test the validity of the theory. The agency also recalled the Panel's
highlighting the need for research on microbial ecology of the skin and its concern about the effect of overuse of antimicrobial
drug products, especially products with a limited spectrum, in hospitals and other closed populations. Therefore,
the agency proposed the professional labeling caution in &sect;333.99(a) ``for certain antimicrobial ingredients
approved for OTC drug use *&blank;*&blank;* used in health-care facilities'' (43 FR 1213). However, the agency concluded
that the limited consumer use of these products in the population at large did not constitute a risk that would warrant
such a label warning. Although benzalkonium chloride has been frequently implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hospital infections, the agency's review of numerous reports and studies on quaternary ammonium compounds and other
antimicrobials (Refs. 4 through 10) indicates that specific causes for contamination, such as lack of aseptic technique
when applying intravenous infusions and sterilization failure of the items used (bottles, tubing, distilled water
used in diluting benzalkonium chloride), were the problem and not overuse of benzalkonium chloride. The agency discussed
this problem in the previous tentative final monograph and stated that it appears that practices in the health-care
facility environments where quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly used often fall short of the minimum necessary
to prevent outbreaks of infection. (See comment 51 43 FR 1210 at 1218.) Benzalkonium chloride is more prone to become
contaminated for several reasons that were brought out in the studies: (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species are among the bacteria most resistant to surface-active agents like quaternary ammonium compounds. (2)
The usual quaternary ammonium compound concentration appears to be ineffective against some species, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas cepacia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an organism which has been reported to have been associated with hospital infections. One study showed that this
organism survived 14 years in a salt solution preserved with 0.05 percent benzalkonium chloride. (3) Organic materials
(gauze, cotton, cork in stoppers, soaps), inorganic matter, protein, and anionic substances inactivate quaternary
ammonium compounds. (4) Hospital personnel are unfamiliar with these problems and with procedures for using quaternary
ammonium compounds safely and effectively. Based on these reports, the agency agrees with the comments that ``improper''
use, not ``overuse,'' is the cause of benzalkonium chloride being implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contamination and that there is a lack of data demonstrating ``overuse'' to be the cause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also agrees with the comment which stated that it was an unproven hypothesis that overuse of an antiseptic
causes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 overgrowth. The ``Summary for Basis of Approval'' from an approved NDA for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) cites
a skin flora study that indicated that the axilla was an area where gram-negative micro-organisms continued to be
isolated even though chlorhexidine gluconate has shown gram-negative effectiveness. The comment cited FDA's Division
of Anti-Infective Drug Products' recognition that for health-care uses, such as surgical scrub and health-care
personnel handwash, there would be no problem with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 overgrowth because the hands are an area of the body not likely to support the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because of the lack of moisture. In defending triclosan, the comment contended that this ingredient is bacteriostatic
and does not eliminate all gram-positive bacteria; therefore, it would not predispose for gram-negative overgrowth.
Triclosan has been implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contamination because it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria, has limited in vitro and in vivo
activity against gram-negative bacteria, and no activity against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (43 FR 1210 at 1232). One report showed that triclosan was effective against some gram-negative micro-organisms,
but not effective against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serratia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 11). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serratia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 resistance caused the contamination, not overuse of the antiseptic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comments that quaternary ammonium compounds and triclosan have been implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hospital infections more frequently than povidone-iodine, but studies indicate that `overuse' of these or any antimicrobial
has not been the cause. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species may become dominant because of inherent resistant factors which enable them to survive the effects of many
antibiotics and antiseptics (Refs. 12, 13, and 14). In addition, this genus is ubiquitous, found in both soil and water,
and can multiply in almost any moist environment with even a trace of organic material (Ref. 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the data and reports have not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care
antiseptics, including benzalkonium chloride and triclosan, have brought about overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria,
particularly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency agrees with the comments that improper use, failure of hospital personnel to use according to labeling
indications, nonaseptic technique in diluting and handling, and lack of good quality control to ensure sterility
of items in contact with antiseptics, such as sterile distilled water, hosing, and receptacles, are responsible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3) shows that repeated in vitro exposure of seven gram-negative micro-organisms,
including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. aeruginosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in povidone-iodine dilutions did not result in the development of resistance. The agency notes that CDC previously
recommended povidone-iodine for use in intravenous catheter and other procedures (Ref. 2). However, there has been
one report from CDC (Ref. 16) which described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hospital infections caused by intrinsically contaminated povidone-iodine (contaminated during manufacture,
indicating failure of control of microbiological contamination). Compliance with the agency's regulations governing
current good manufacturing practice for finished pharmaceuticals (21 CFR part 211) should prevent intrinsic contamination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency concludes that a cautionary statement against overuse is not needed in the professional
labeling of health-care antiseptic drug products. Therefore, the previously proposed caution in &sect;333.99(a)
is not being included in this tentative final monograph. If new information indicates a need for a cautionary statement,
the agency will consider appropriate action at that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data on the safety and effectiveness of alcohol formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an emolliented vehicle for use as a surgical hand scrub, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, and hand degermer were submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Miscellaneous External Panel (Refs. 2 and 3). However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data were not reviewed or categorized for these uses during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rulemaking. In reviewing alcohol for short-term uses, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel stated, ``ethyl alcohol acts relatively quickly to decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of micro-organisms on the skin surface. Each minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that scrubbed hands and arms were immersed in approximately 77 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent ethyl alcohol by volume was found to be equivalent to 6.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes of scrubbing in water; if the skin was scrubbed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol, the rate was further increased'' (47 FR 22324 at 22328). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel found ethyl alcohol safe and effective for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial preparation in concentrations of 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution. The following

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indications were proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrapes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splinter or other foreign object.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol
drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submissions (Refs. 1 and 2) included effectiveness data and labeling for a currently marketed product containing
62 percent ethyl alcohol formulated in an emolliented vehicle and dispensed as a foam used ``*&blank;*&blank;* to
degerm hands *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The agency has reviewed these data, derived from effectiveness testing as a surgical
hand scrub (glove juice test) and health-care personnel handwash, and finds that they meet the procedures in the testing
guidelines in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242). Statistical analyses showed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial reduction to be highly significant. A glove juice test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that alcohol foam reduced the baseline number of bacteria present in normal skin flora, after first use, by
1.87 logs, and, after continued use for 5 days, by 2.36 logs. The reduction of the baseline number of bacteria was maintained
for up to 6 hours under surgical gloves. A health-care personnel handwash effectiveness test showed microbial reduction
on test subjects' hands, artificially contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serratia marcescens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. marcescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Microbial reduction averaged 3.3 logs after 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatments and 3.63 logs after 25 treatments. In vitro data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from studies using 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. marcescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the test bacteria, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that alcohol properly formulated in an emolliented vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and dispensed as a foam, significantly reduced the number of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria, in 10 percent serum, within 15 seconds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these data and the conclusions of the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel (47 FR 22324), the agency concludes that alcohol, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when properly formulated, is effective for use as a surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it is well established that alcohol alone does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide persistence, the agency notes that a preservative agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vehicle provided the persistent effect to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the baseline number of bacteria for 6 hours as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to demonstrate efficacy as a surgical hand scrub drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is including alcohol in proposed &sect;333.410(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.412(a) (patient preoperative skin preparation), and &sect;333.414(a) (surgical hand scrub), as follows:
``Alcohol 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulations in 27 CFR part 20.'' Further, the agency finds the Miscellaneous External Panel's proposed Category
I indication for OTC alcohol drug products, i.e., ``for preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' to be an appropriate
indication for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. Based on that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel's recommendations, the agency is including this indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an additional claim for alcohol drug products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.460(b)(2) of the proposed monograph. In addition, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Panel's similar recommendations for isopropyl alcohol (47 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22324 at 22329 and 22332), the agency is proposing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication for OTC isopropyl alcohol drug products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.460(b)(3). As discussed in section I.N., comment 28, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing new effectiveness criteria for drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monograph will also state that an alcohol drug product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be properly formulated, such as the product in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emolliented vehicle dispensed as a foam discussed above, to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test requirements in &sect;333.470. This means that alcohol when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended for certain uses must be able to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness by certain tests proposed in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph, as follows: (1) Antiseptic or health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash_&sect;333.470(b)(2), (2) patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation_&sect;333.470(b) (3), and (3) surgical hand scrub_&sect;333.470(b)(1). As discussed in section
I.B., comment 5, the term ``antiseptic handwash'' in lieu of ``hand degermer'' is being proposed in the monograph
as the statement of identity for this type of product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The labeling for the alcohol product (Ref. 1) provides directions for use without water rinsing, where water is not
readily available, as follows: ``A `palmful' (5 grams) is dispensed in one hand. It is spread on both hands and rubbed
into the skin until dry (approximately 1 to 2 minutes). A smaller amount (2.5 grams) is then dispensed into one hand,
spread over both hands to wrist, and rubbed into the skin until dry (approximately 30 seconds).'' The agency concurs
with these directions and is incorporating them into its proposed directions for use for OTC topical antiseptic drug
products, including alcohol, formulated for use without water in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. See proposed &sect;333.455(c) and &sect;333.465(c).

11. Several comments requested that the agency include chlorhexidine gluconate as a Category I ingredient in any
amended tentative final monograph. The comments submitted references and data to establish general recognition
of safety and effectiveness (Ref. 1), and stated that chlorhexidine gluconate solution is recognized in the ``British
Pharmacopeia'' (Ref. 2) and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulated in a wide range of products that have been successfully marketed to a material extent and for a material
length of time in other countries. The comments asserted that when formulated in compliance with FDA's current good

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing practice regulations (21 CFR part 211), chlorhexidine products are safe and effective for use as skin
wound cleansers, skin wound protectants, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, surgical
hand scrubs, and health-care personnel handwashes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reply comment argued that chlorhexidine gluconate, currently marketed in the United States under approved new
drug applications (NDA's), is not eligible for an OTC drug monograph because the ingredient has not been marketed
within this country to a material extent and for a material length of time. The comment added that variations in final
formulations may alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and effectiveness of the ingredient. The comment submitted data (Ref. 3) to support this viewpoint and requested
that chlorhexidine gluconate be classified in Category II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210), chlorhexidine gluconate (4 percent solution) was neither
addressed nor categorized as Category I, II, or III. However, subsequent to the tentative final monograph, the agency
granted a petition (Ref. 4) and in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1979, reopened the administrative record to allow interested persons an opportunity to submit data and
information (44 FR 13041). The comments (Ref. 1) and reply comment (Ref. 2) were submitted in response to that notice.
However, since that time a majority of the comments on chlorhexidine submitted in response to the notice have been
withdrawn (Ref. 5). While the withdrawn comments remain on public display as part of the administrative record, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are no longer being considered in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the marketing history of chlorhexidine gluconate and finds that although it has been marketed
for professional or hospital use under NDA's, insufficient data remain in the public administrative record for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking to support general recognition of safety and effectiveness for OTC use. Accordingly, chlorhexidine
gluconate 4 percent aqueous solution as a health-care antiseptic is a new drug and is not included in this tentative
final monograph.

G. Comments on Chloroxylenol

12. A number of comments disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of chloroxylenol in the tentative
final monograph. They argued that a reevaluation of the data previously submitted to the agency along with new data
that have been submitted (Refs. 1 through 16) would provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justification for classifying chloroxylenol in Category I for safety and effectiveness for use in antimicrobial
soaps, health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, skin wound
cleansers, skin wound protectants, and surgical hand scrubs. Several comments pointed out that the Antimicrobial
II Panel unanimously concluded that chloroxylenol is generally recognized as safe for topical use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
athlete's foot and jock-itch preparations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the submitted data (Refs. 1 through 16) and other information reviewed by the Antimicrobial Panels, the
agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that chloroxylenol
(0.24 percent to 3.75 percent) was safe but not effective for short-term use as an OTC topical first aid antiseptic
(54 FR 33644 at 33658). These data (Refs. 1 through 16) and new data submitted under the agency's ``feedback'' procedures
(Refs. 17 through 30) are insufficient to support a Category I classification of the safety and effectiveness of the
ingredient for other long-term uses, e.g., antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical
hand scrub. The agency concludes that chloroxylenol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains classified in Category III as an active ingredient for these uses. However, the ingredient would be considered
safe for short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation but remains in Category III due to a lack of effectiveness
data for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1222 and 1238), the agency stated that the data were insufficient
to reclassify chloroxylenol into Category I, and the ingredient remained in Category III for safety and effectiveness.
Indicating concern about the absorption of topically applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial drug products used repeatedly by consumers over a number of years, the agency stated the following
regarding the safety of the ingredient:

Only the most superficial toxicity data in animals were submitted to and reviewed by the Panel. The Commissioner concurs
with the Panel that toxicity in rodent and nonrodent species, substantivity, blood levels, distribution and metabolism,
as well as any subsequent systemic absorption studies must be characterized *&blank;*&blank;*. The degree of absorption
of PCMX following topical administration has not been established. The target organ for PCMX toxicity in

animals also remains unidentified and should be shown in a long-term animal toxicity study.

While safety data (Refs. 1, 2, 6, and 7) are sufficient to establish safety for short-term use such as for a patient preoperative
skin preparation drug product, these data do not resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity. Conclusions
on these data, which were also reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products (Antimicrobial
II Panel) in conjunction with its review of OTC topical antifungal drug products, were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 23, 1982 (47 FR 12480). That Panel, which evaluated the safety of the ingredient for use in OTC topical antifungal
drug products, categorized chloroxylenol (0.5 to 3.75 percent) as safe (Category I) for short-term use (up to 13 weeks)
and advised, ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;relatively low doses of chloroxylenol can be systemically tolerated,
at least over a 13-week period. The Panel is concerned about the effect of chronic administration on the liver, but
does not consider that topical application of chloroxylenol to small areas of the skin over short periods of time would
result in liver damage.'' (47 FR 12480 at 12534). The agency subsequently agreed with the Panel's conclusions concerning
the safety of using the ingredient in OTC topical antifungal drug products for the treatment of athlete's foot, jock
itch, and ringworm (maximum treatment duration 4 weeks) in its tentative final monograph for these OTC drug products,
published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 12, 1989 (54 FR 51136 at 51139). The agency subsequently finalized these conclusions in the final rule
for OTC topical antifungal drug products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49890). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding long-term chronic toxicity, data and information provided by one manufacturer included final reports
of completed studies and interim reports of incomplete studies (Ref. 2). The information also contained a protocol
of a planned preclinical study (projected starting and completion dates for experiments) which identified a 2-year
rat feeding study. Because this study might resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity, the agency requested
the raw data (Ref. 31); however, the manufacturer declined to submit the data, explaining that it is no longer interested
in marketing chloroxylenol, that its study had not been completed, and that the study was conducted prior to establishment
of the Good Laboratory Practices regulations (Ref. 32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the agency's determination that data from a 2-year rat feeding study were essential (Ref. 33), another
manufacturer submitted additional information along with copies of already available safety data (Ref. 34). The
manufacturer explained that it believes that long-term safety data, i.e., 2-year oral feeding study, while not currently
available, may not be a necessity. Citing statements made by the Panel, that its recommended guidelines for the safety
testing of these drug products were developed primarily for antimicrobial agents applied to the entire body surface
and that appropriate tests should be chosen to reflect the intended use of the antimicrobial drug product (39 FR 33103
at 33135), the manufacturer contended that the guidelines were developed to address the most extreme exposure to
an antimicrobial ingredient rather than to describe the minimal requirements for safety data that the Panel would
find acceptable. Noting the contrast between the use of surgical hand scrub drug products (products used by adults
in a limited area of the body for a specified time span) with lifetime application to the entire body in bar soaps, the
manufacturer contended that while the use of a surgical hand scrub is considered chronic use, the exposure to the antimicrobial
ingredient during such use is limited to the hand and half the distance to the elbow. The manufacturer further suggested
that one might simply regard the use of health-care antiseptic ingredients in handwashes and surgical scrubs as repeated
daily use in a limited area of the body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer contended that data from a 2-year feeding study would not contribute any information on the long-term
safety of chloroxylenol that is not already available from subchronic studies (Ref. 35). In support of its contention,
the manufacturer submitted data from subchronic animal toxicity and human bathing studies (Ref. 18) previously
submitted in response to the tentative final monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products and to the Antimicrobial
II Panel. The data also included computer simulation models (Ref. 36) of plasma levels of chloroxylenol that might
occur after dermal applications of varying concentrations of the ingredient. The simulations, based on urinary
excretion data from human bathing studies, predict a lack of potential for accumulation of the ingredient in humans.
Subsequent submissions from the same manufacturer included a review article on the toxicity of chloroxylenol (Ref.
19), a retrospective analysis of the value of chronic animal toxicology studies of pharmaceutical compounds (Ref.
20), and copies of all available toxicity data for chloroxylenol (Ref. 21). Included in the toxicity data was a kinetic
analysis (Ref. 37) of data from human and animal studies of the ingredient previously submitted to the agency that
also predicts that accumulation in humans is not likely to occur at reasonable exposure levels. Based on the above
data and information, the manufacturer requested that the agency reconsider the necessity of a long-term animal
study. In response to the manufacturer's request, a public meeting was held to discuss the available toxicity data
for chloroxylenol. At that meeting, the agency noted that many of the subchronic studies of the ingredient are of limited
usefulness because they were conducted using a formulated product that contained isopropyl alcohol, turpineols,
and castor oil soap in addition to chloroxylenol. The kinetic model used in the studies was considered inappropriate.
A one-compartment model, as used in the analysis, is not relevant to chloroxylenol due to its lipophilic nature. The
agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 38 and 39).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the manufacturer's comments and evaluating the data available at the time, the agency concluded
that the information was not adequate to characterize the level of absorption, the distribution, the metabolism,
and the excretion of chloroxylenol following topical administration. In a 1988 letter to the manufacturer (Ref.
40), the agency stated: (1) That data from the human bathing studies reviewed are highly variable (absorption 0.5
to 15.7 percent), (2) the analytical methodology used in the studies had not been validated and (3) that the small number
of subjects included in the studies made it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the reported results. The
agency commented further that submitted accumulation predictions were not adequate to define the toxicity that
might occur with repeated exposure to the ingredient because no data have been submitted to support or validate the
model's assumptions in characterizing exposure and stated that additional data are needed to justify, support,
and verify the assumptions and data used in the predictions. Pointing out that accumulation is not the sole issue of
long-term toxicity, the agency asserted that long-term toxicity may be related to repeated daily exposure to low
levels of the ingredient over a lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that same letter, the agency stated that it had reexamined the necessity for a long-term animal study based on the
manufacturer's assertion that use of the ingredient as an antiseptic handwash and surgical scrub should be regarded
as repeated use to a limited area of the body, and had concluded that data from additional short-term studies conducted
under actual use conditions (i.e., where abrasion is followed by occlusion, with the level of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient being shown under these conditions) could provide adequate information
to determine whether or not a long-term animal study is necessary. Protocols for a pharmacokinetic surgical scrub
study to develop such data were submitted to the agency (Refs. 41 and 42); however, to date the agency has not received
any data from such a study. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 43 and
44). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More recently, the agency received additional data pertaining to the safety of chloroxylenol from another manufacturer
(Ref. 30). The data included an assessment of the ingredient's mutagenic potential by a series of in vitro and in vivo
assays (Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster
ovary cells, and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay). The data also included a dose range-finding study for a teratology
study of the ingredient in rats and the subsequent teratology study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the four mutagenicity assays included in the submission yielded suspect or equivocal results. The in vitro
administration of 19, 38, 75, and 150 micrograms per milliliter (&mu;g/mL) doses of chloroxylenol to Chinese hamster
ovary cells produced a statistically significant increase relative to the solvent control in the mean number of chromosome
aberrations per cell at the 75 and 150 &mu;g/mL dose level both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.
Statistically significant increases in the percent of aberrant cells were also seen at the 75 &mu;g/mL dose in the
absence of metabolic activation and at the 75 and 150 &mu;g/mL doses in the presence of metabolic activation. No dose
response was apparent in either the activated or nonactivated systems. The investigator concluded that the results
were equivocal in the nonactivated test system and suspect in the activated test system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay demonstrated a statistically significant increase in micronucleated
polychromatic erythrocytes in female mice 24 and 72 hours after oral dosing with 250 and 833 milligrams per kilogram
(mg/kg) doses of chloroxylenol. However, no dose response was apparent. The investigator considered the results
to be a statistical anomaly based on unusually low mean micronucleus values in the negative control group and the lack
of a dose response. However, the agency believes that because the observed increases were significantly elevated
over those of the negative controls (p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0276 grid5678 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 0.01) and were reproducible at two dose levels, these results should be considered equivocal. The manufacturer has
provided additional information (Ref. 45) in response to the agency's interpretation of the results of the mouse
micronucleus assay. However, the agency continues to believe that reliance on data from historical controls is inappropriate
and has not changed its position on the data. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(Refs. 46 and 47). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the new data (Ref. 30) and the issues that they raise, the agency has again reexamined the data requirements
necessary to support the safe chronic use of this ingredient. The agency finds it necessary to broaden the additional
testing requirements in order to clearly assess potential risks associated with chronic use of chloroxylenol. Therefore,
data obtained from the following are necessary: (1) Human studies conducted under maximal use conditions, i.e.,
repeated use as a surgical scrub use where abrasion is followed by occlusion, characterizing the level of absorption,
the distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient, (2) a lifetime dermal carcinogenicity study (up
to 2 years) in mice, and (3) an appropriate human epidemiological study performed to determine the effects on health-care
professionals in countries, such as England, where the ingredient has been used extensively for a long period of time
are necessary. Further, in order to relate the data derived from the chronic animal study to humans, the lifetime dermal
carcinogenicity study should also include concomitant absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies.
A protocol for an 18-month dermal carcinogenicity study has been submitted to the agency (Ref. 48). The agency's detailed
comments and evaluation of the data and protocol are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 47).

Regarding the effectiveness of chloroxylenol, the agency stated the following in the previous tentative final monograph:
``Claims for broad spectrum activity have been made *&blank;*&blank;*; however, the Commissioner finds that inadequate
effectiveness data were submitted. Many studies were old and not performed with modern antiseptic testing procedures.
*&blank;*&blank;* effectiveness testing both in vitro and in vivo should be done in accordance with the Guidelines''
(43 FR 1238). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicable effectiveness data submitted by the comments were derived from in vivo and in vitro studies (Refs.
1 through 7 and 13 through 16), along with data subsequently submitted under the ``feedback'' procedures (Refs. 22
through 28 and 50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from in vivo glove juice studies (Refs. 1, 2, 19, and 50) demonstrated the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol
in a range of 3 to 3.75 percent when formulated in an aqueous surfactant vehicle. Chloroxylenol formulations are substantive
in their activity, i.e., they do not produce an initial high reduction in the number of bacteria but after repeated
use (routine use), they reduce the baseline number of bacteria and suppress bacterial growth for 6 hours. In vivo data
for surgical hand scrub products containing chloroxylenol at concentrations lower than 3 percent are insufficient.
Aqueous solutions of chloroxylenol in a pine oil vehicle (1:40 dilution of Dettol

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from the hands of test subjects (Ref. 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In vivo cup scrubbing and other appropriate data (Refs. 22, 23, and 24) indicate that chloroxylenol, in 70 percent
alcohol, is fast acting as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, alcohol itself meets the criteria for
a preoperative skin preparation and is a significant contributor for fast acting contaminant reduction. The data
are not sufficient to demonstrate that chloroxylenol in this formulation contributes to the total antimicrobial
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In vitro study data (Refs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, and 26) show that chloroxylenol in various vehicles is effective against
gram-negative bacteria, i.e.,

 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This anti-gram-negative activity is formulation dependent. Tested aqueous solutions of pure chloroxylenol
with no other additives show that low concentrations (0.3 mg/mL) reduced 95 percent of some

 in 10 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data regarding the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol itself are not adequate. While the data are considered sufficient
to support in vitro effectiveness for the finished products, the available data are inadequate to show the contribution
of the chloroxylenol. Because these finished products contain several additional ingredients, e.g., surfactants,
isopropanol, pine oil, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which contributed substantial germicidal
activity, conclusions regarding chloroxylenol's active contribution to the product's efficacy cannot be supported.
The agency's detailed comments and evaluations of the submitted data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(Refs. 51 and 52). One manufacturer has responded to FDA's concern and provided additional data (Ref. 53). These data
are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products. In summary,
the data are sufficient to support the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of the formulations tested. However, additional
data are needed to demonstrate that chloroxylenol contributes to the activity of these formulations. In addition,
data from glove juice studies indicate that the antimicrobial activity of chloroxylenol is substantive in nature
and does not produce an initial high reduction of bacteria, but that repeated use of the ingredient will produce a reduction
in bacteria as well as a suppression of the baseline number of bacteria of the normal skin flora for 6 hours. As discussed
in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing that all antimicrobial products indicated for use as a surgical
scrub or health-care personnel handwash be able to demonstrate an immediate reduction in bacteria and is inviting
comment on the use of substantive antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency, therefore, is proposing that chloroxylenol at the concentrations evaluated (0.24 percent to 3.75 percent)
be classified as Category I for safety and Category III for effectiveness for short-term use as a patient preoperative
skin preparation and in Category III for safety and effectiveness for long-term uses, i.e., antiseptic handwash
or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub. The existing data are not adequate to extrapolate and
assess the chronic toxicity of chloroxylenol for long-term use. Before chloroxylenol may be generally recognized
as effective, the agency recommends that appropriate in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data be submitted. The data
should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo tests as described in the testing procedures below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. One comment urged reconsideration of hexachlorophene as an OTC ``handwashing agent and antimicrobial skin cleanser
for use in the hospital, doctor's office, and by adult consumers.'' The comment stated that adequate data to support
Category I status were submitted in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, but were only superficially
discussed by the agency in comment 61 of the tentative final monograph. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210 at 1220.) The comment submitted additional data to support the safety of hexachlorophene,
including a retrospective study on 3 percent hexachlorophene in baby bathing (Ref. 1) and a study of hexachlorophene
blood levels in infants receiving routine antiseptic skin care (Ref. 2). The comment also included a comprehensive
review article on the safety and effectiveness of hexachlorophene (Ref. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reevaluated the data discussed in comment 61 in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1220) and evaluated
the new data, and has determined that the data do not warrant changing the classification of hexachlorophene as a prescription
drug. The infant data (Refs. 1 and 2) were discussed in detail in the tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial
diaper rash drug products (55 FR 25246 at 25261 to 25263). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summaries of handwash studies were also submitted, but no data were included. In one study, 3 percent hexachlorophene
was tested as a surgical scrub under exaggerated use conditions (Ref. 4). Subjects (number not specified) washed
their hands and forearms in 20 mL hexachlorophene for 10 minutes, 5 times daily, 6 days a week for a total of 58 days. No
signs of toxicity were reported. The blood levels of hexachlorophene reached a plateau 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 3 days at mean levels of 0.07 &mu;g/mL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it would be necessary to test a very large group of subjects (the number of subjects required
to obtain a statistically significant result) with a variety of skin conditions to determine the true degree of absorption.
A similar study reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33103 at 33118) reported blood levels of 0.5 &mu;g/mL or higher. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the other study, subjects washed their hands and face three times daily for 3 weeks with either 2 or 5 mL of 3 percent
hexachlorophene (Ref. 4). Blood concentrations reached a plateau within 7 days at mean levels of 0.21 &mu;g/mL for
the 2-mL group and 0.22 &mu;g/mL for the 5-mL group.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other additional data contained only a brief summary of the historical use of hexachlorophene and primarily cited
publications in the medical literature (Ref. 5). The references provided no new information. Consequently, the
agency has determined that hexachlorophene will continue on prescription status subject to the existing regulation
in 21 CFR 250.250. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for hexachlorophene to be switched to OTC status, the concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel that
hexachlorophene does not have an adequate margin of safety for OTC use (39 FR 33103 at 33117) should be addressed. After
reviewing the submitted data, the agency concludes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of this ingredient for OTC use on infants has not been demonstrated. For OTC status for use by adults, any further
submission of data should specifically address the safe OTC use of hexachlorophene in adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the discussion above, the agency is proposing that hexachlorophene remain available by prescription
only, except when used as a preservative at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 6).

14. One comment pointed out that poloxamer-iodine complex appeared to be incorrectly included in the Category II
list under ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1227), while it is properly listed in Category III for
use as a ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1229). The comment stated that deletion from the Category
II list would correct the error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concurs with the comment that poloxamer-iodine complex for use as a health-care personnel handwash was
incorrectly listed as Category II (43 FR 1227) and that the listing as Category III (43 FR 1229) was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment submitted data on the safety and effectiveness of a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting of iodine complexed
by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Ref. 1). The comment stated that this information
had been previously submitted in May 1974, but that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient had not been mentioned in the Panel's report or in the agency's proposed monograph and requested that the
agency include it in the monograph. The comment pointed out that the iodophor, formulated as a liquid hand scrub, is
intended for use by surgeons, food handlers, and others for whom reduced bacterial skin flora is of public health significance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment's statement that the data were previously submitted, the agency has no record of any submission
of these data in 1974. Because this hand scrub was not previously reviewed or categorized as an OTC topical antimicrobial
drug product, the agency reviewed the product's marketing history and considers it appropriate to include this product
in the OTC drug review. The agency has evaluated the data submitted by the comment (Ref. 1) and determined that iodine
complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate is safe for use as a surgical hand scrub
and health-care personnel handwash, but that there are insufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data available to determine its effectiveness for these uses. Therefore, the ingredient is being classified in Category
III.

The data included several studies on the absorption of the iodine complex, blood levels of iodine, and the systemic
toxicity of the iodine complex. Protein-bound iodine (PBI) and iodine blood levels in rabbits were determined following
two studies of acute dermal applications. In the first study, either 2 or 5 mL/kilogram (kg) of the test iodine complex
was applied to the shaved backs of rabbits in one experiment. The method of occlusion, if any, was not stated, but the
test material was washed off after 24 hours. In another experiment, 2 mL/kg of the test iodine complex was compared
with a povidone-iodine complex and both were applied as in the first experiment. PBI and total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine in blood were determined at 0, 24, and 48 hours in both experiments. In all treated animals, the level of PBI was
extremely high at certain times, primarily at 24 hours. Animals receiving the higher dose of iodine complex in the
first experiment seemed to return to normal sooner than those receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower dose. All animals returned to normal by 14 days. For purposes of comparison, the second experiment showed
that serum total iodine increased from 1.4 to 30.7 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) in the test iodine complex group
compared to from 1.23 to 37.9 mg/dL in the povidone-iodine group in the 24 hours that the application remained on. In
the second study, 5 mL/kg of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test iodine complex was applied to the shaved backs of two groups of five rabbits each. In one group the shaved backs
were occluded for 24 hours and in the other group, the shaved backs were scrubbed for 10 minutes followed by rinsing
and occlusion. An additional group served as an untreated control group. Blood samples for iodine determinations
were taken at 0, 24, and 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours and at 14 days. All five animals in the group in which the iodine complex remained occluded on intact skin for 24
hours had markedly elevated levels of PBI and iodine at both 24 and 48 hours, but were only slightly above normal at 14
days. For the 10-minute scrub animals, the PBI levels were increased in two of five animals at 24 hours, slightly in
all five animals at 48 hours, and were normal at 14 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study to determine the effect on blood PBI levels of a routine scrubbing procedure in which exposure to the iodine
complex exceeded normal use showed no alteration in PBI levels in four humans who scrubbed twice daily (each scrub
consisting of two 5 minute hand washes with 5 mL) for 26 consecutive days. Also, no irritation was observed. In a similar
study in which the subjects wore gloves for 2 hours after each scrub, PBI levels were not increased, but total iodine
was slightly increased. In two subjects, this increase was greater in the middle of the study, but the total iodine
blood levels were near normal by the end of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A dermal absorption study in which the shaved backs of four monkeys were rubbed with 0.17 mL/kg of radioactive iodine
complex for 10 minutes, rinsed, wrapped for 2 hours, and the animals sacrificed after 24 hours, revealed that less
than 0.1 percent of the application was recovered in the thyroid, the target organ for iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 90-day sub-acute dermal toxicity study was conducted in three groups of monkeys divided into one control group and
two test groups. One test group was scrubbed once for 10 minutes daily with 0.17 mL/kg of the iodine surgical scrub detergent
product and the second group was scrubbed three times with 0.34 mL/kg (once for 10 minutes and twice for 3 minutes each
day). To simulate the wearing of surgical gloves, the treated area of each animal, which consisted of a shaved area
of the back equivalent to about 10 percent of the body area, was wrapped with a rubber dam for 30 to 90 minutes. The study
lasted 13 weeks during which the animals were monitored. Neither test group showed any effects of iodophor treatment
except elevated PBI levels in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high dose group, which peaked at one month. Also, there was no significant effect on the thyroid in the treated groups.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes this iodine complex is safe for humans based on the data from human, rabbit, and monkey studies.
Test data showed very little iodine absorption when the product was used as a scrub, negligible uptake (following
acute dermal application of radioactive iodine complex) by the thyroid in monkeys, and an unchanged thyroid weight
in test groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monkeys following 90 days of sub-acute applications of the iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment submitted data from one clinical study for evaluating effectiveness as a surgical hand scrub but did not
provide the testing protocol used. Five subjects scrubbed three times daily for 5 days with the iodophor formulation
(containing 1.1 percent iodine). Four subjects completed the study. Surgical gloves were worn for 2 hours after the
first wash of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day. Subjects' hands were sampled once each day at the end of the 2-hour gloved period using a single-basin Cade method.
The initial sampling was used to establish a baseline microbial count for each subject. Study results were reported
as the number of organisms per mL of basin water and the percent reduction in the number of organisms recovered. The
reduction in the bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population ranged from 89 to 98 percent on the first day. By the fifth day, the reduction ranged from 99 to 100 percent.
Similar results were obtained in a comparative study on six subjects using povidone-iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is clear that the test used was not the glove juice test which is described in the antimicrobial tentative
final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242), alternative methods may be acceptable. However, because of the small number
of subjects included in the study, the data are not sufficient to support the Category I classification of this ingredient
for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub. Additional studies, of the type described in &sect;333.470(b)(1) of this amended tentative
final monograph, are necessary to support the effectiveness of this surfactant iodine complex for this use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1235), the agency recognized that elemental iodine complexed with
a surfactant type ``carrier'' molecule reduces the amount of immediate ``free'' iodine, because most of the formulated
iodine is bound in the complex. Effectiveness of all iodophors is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent on the release of free iodine as the active agent from the complexing molecule which acts only as a carrier.
The agency acknowledges that iodine complexed with a surfactant is an acceptable way of presenting iodine as an antimicrobial
agent to the skin. However, because most of the formulated iodine may be tied up in the complex and because the information
submitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comment to support in vitro efficacy (Ref. 2) dealt only with aqueous and/or tincture solutions of free iodine,
testing of the complete formulation is necessary to judge the importance of formulation on the release of the active
ingredient and, thus, its influence on aspects of effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the data submitted, the agency concludes that iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene
sorbitan monolaurate is safe but additional data from appropriate studies are needed to establish general recognition
of effectiveness for use as a surgical hand scrub and health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash. The data should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo testing procedures. (See
section I.N., comment 28.)

16. Several comments objected to the warning proposed for the professional labeling for povidone-iodine and iodophor-surfactant
products: ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors
and the resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(abnormal union of the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' (43 FR 1210 at 1221). The comments
pointed out that the study by Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) on which the warning is based is not well controlled,
is rudimentary, and lacks rigorous testing that produces evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which can be statistically analyzed. The comments contended that this article is not sufficient basis for the warning.
The comments requested that the impact of the article by Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson on the labeling of nonsurfactant
iodophors be reevaluated and that povidone-iodine be exempt from the required warning relating to contact of starch
and iodophors. One comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that there are numerous papers in the literature describing the antiadhesive effect of povidone and povidone-iodine
and submitted nine references dealing with humans and animals that support an antiadhesive effect when povidone
or povidone-iodine is used in intraperitoneal surgery (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment explained that starch is well known for producing granuloma and that every package of surgeons' gloves
carries a warning statement to the effect that the outside of the gloves must be cleansed of starch powder prior to use.
The comment concluded that FDA should require a warning label on the gloves, but not on products containing the drug.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has reevaluated the article by Goodrich et al. (Ref. 1), considered the additional cited references (Ref. 2),
and examined current policy on the labeling of United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) Absorbable Dusting Powder (cornstarch).
Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) provide data from observations and arbitrary scoring of adhesions after intraperitoneal
injection into 4 groups of 13 adult female mice with: (1) Powdered starch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline, (2) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of an iodophor and washed three times in saline
before resuspension in 1.5 mL normal saline, (3) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of a 10-percent solution of surfactant
washed three times in saline and resuspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline and (4) normal saline (control animals). The
data do not indicate any significant difference between suspensions of the surfactant mixed with starch and the surfactant-iodophor
mixed with starch. The agency's policy on the labeling of surgical gloves treated with Absorbable Dusting Powder
U.S.P., determined upon evidence presented during the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 25, 1971 (36 FR 9475). The agency requires the following statement on surgical gloves treated with Absorbable
Dusting Powder U.S.P.: ``Caution: after donning, remove powder by wiping gloves thoroughly with a sterile wet sponge,
sterile wet towel, or other effective method.'' Products containing Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. for lubricating
surgical gloves were formerly classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as new drugs, but are now regarded as transitional devices, for which premarket approval is required under the Medical
Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (42 FR 63472 at 63474). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological
Health is establishing categories for all surgical devices, including surgical gloves lubricated with powdered
starch. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the labeling for this class of products will be dealt with in a separate rulemaking procedure and separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the user's removal of dusting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powder from surgical medical devices (rubber goods) treated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. decreases the incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhesions and is not persuaded that the data in the article by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson provide a sufficient scientific basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a warning label. Therefore, the warning about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of iodophors and starch-containing products proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

17. A number of comments submitted new data (Ref. 1) to establish that povidone-iodine is safe and effective as a topical
antimicrobial drug. The comments requested that povidone-iodine be reclassified from Category III to Category
I as a topical antimicrobial ingredient for use as an antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel handwash, surgical
hand scrub, patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this document, this amended tentative final monograph addresses only topical antiseptics
for health-care antiseptic uses as a surgical hand scrub, antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash,
and patient preoperative skin preparation. As discussed in section I.B., comment 5, antimicrobial soaps are no longer
included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. The agency addressed the other use categories mentioned in the comment in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644). As discussed in comment 38 of that document (56 FR 33660),
FDA has tentatively concluded that povidone-iodine should be classified in Category I for use as a first aid antiseptic
(formerly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the new data submitted and other information in support of the request to reclassify povidone-iodine
from Category III to Category I. On the basis of these data and information, the agency tentatively concludes that
povidone-iodine should be reclassified from Category III to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category I as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation,
and health-care personnel or antiseptic handwash drug products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The general safety aspects of povidone-iodine that concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 1234 to 1236) are addressed elsewhere as follows: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of povidone-iodine on wound healing. Based upon submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, the agency concluded in the first aid antiseptic segment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking that non-surfactant iodophor products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(povidone-iodine) do not delay wound healing. See comment 42 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that document (56 FR 33644 at 33662). Also, the Advisory Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine's effect on wound healing in its report on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antifungal drug products and concluded that the drug did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not affect wound healing (47 FR 12480 at 12545). (2) The effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of povidone-iodine on thyroid function. In comment 41 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products (56 FR 33644 at 33661), the agency discusses studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that indicate that topically applied povidone-iodine does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause thyroid dysfunction. (3) The proposed warning about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of starch-containing products with iodophors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting in serosal adhesions and other undesirable effects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions (abnormal union of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(43 FR 1210 at 1221). The agency has reevaluated the proposal and decided that the warning is not supported by the data.
(See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.I., comment 16.) (4) The agency's concern regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weights of povidone-iodine greater than 35,000 daltons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not being excreted by the kidney and causing lymph node changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section I.I., comment 18, the agency discusses a previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed warning regarding this subject and determines, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more recent data, that larger povidone-iodine molecules are not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk when the product is limited to the topical uses included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's concern about the need for expiration dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(not to exceed 2 years after manufacture) because of the lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability data for several iodophor preparations, which relates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the effectiveness of the product, can be satisfied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the current good manufacturing practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, among other things, requirements regarding stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and expiration dating (see &sect;&sect;211.137 and 211.166). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as discussed in comment 40 of the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 33661), data on the stability of povidone-iodine and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 2-year expiration date are no longer considered needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this rulemaking proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second agency concern relating to effectiveness was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of release of ``free'' iodine from the complex and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there was evidence of germicidal activity over a period of time in clinical application (43 FR 1210 at 1235). As discussed
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tentative final monograph for OTC topical acne drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(comment 5, 50 FR 2172 at 2173), iodine is released from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine complex within milliseconds, thus resolving this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the effectiveness of health-care antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses subject to this rulemaking, the agency has reviewed the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and information on povidone-iodine's germicidal in vitro and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic in vivo effectiveness (Refs. 1 through 19) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that the data are sufficient to reclassify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient from Category III to Category I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A series of in vitro controlled studies (Ref. 1&hyph;C133, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume 1) included a broad spectrum of test micro-organisms which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were associated with between 40 to 60 percent of the nosocomial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infections in the urinary tract, surgical wounds, pneumonia, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bloodstream, reported by the National Nosocomial Infections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance System (NNIS) for the period from January 1985 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 1988 (Ref. 2). In most instances, these test micro-organisms, as proposed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) (see
section I.C., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 6), were killed after 0.5 to 5 minutes exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1&hyph;C133) using 30 cultures, both American Type Culture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collection (ATCC) and recent skin isolates, was also included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this series of in vitro studies. The results indicated a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for MIC from 87 parts per million (ppm) to 492 ppm for dilutions of povidone-iodine solution and 83 ppm to 476 ppm for
dilutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of povidone-iodine surgical scrub depending on the test micro-organism. Tests with controls, neutralizer, and
organic load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a serial dilution method were included in the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gocke, Ponticas, and Pollack (Ref. 3) evaluated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates from blood, urine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sputum, and wound cultures to the bacteriocidal activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine. These clinical isolates contained over half the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms included in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). Results indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 106 of the 230 organisms tested (46 percent) were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when 1 mL of a standardized suspension containing 108 organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was exposed to a 10 percent povidone-iodine solution for 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seconds. Povidone-iodine showed its highest activity against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gram-negative isolates, with 72 of the 94 isolates (75 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being killed after a 15-second exposure. Only 34 of the 134 (25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent) gram-positive isolates were killed under the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. However, further testing of organisms not killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after a 15-second exposure indicated that increases in exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to 120 seconds killed all of the previously ``resistant'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isolates. The study design incorporated the use of a neutralizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and controls.

The effectiveness of a povidone-iodine formulation on micro-organisms in a clinical setting was demonstrated by
Michael (Ref. 4). The study included 100 subjects with decubitus ulcers following a spinal cord injury. Cultures
of the wounds were taken prior to, during, and upon completion of a once-a-day povidone-iodine treatment. Prior to
treatment, subjects had positive cultures for the following organisms: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(60 subjects), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Klebsiella/Enterobacter
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (15 subjects), and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species (15 species). Following an 8-to-10 week period of treatment with povidone-iodine, cultures revealed that
90 of the 110 subjects no longer had positive cultures for these organisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pereira, Lee, and Wade (Ref. 5) conducted an in vivo gloved hand test that is supportive of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine
as a surgical hand scrub. They examined the effects of surgical scrub duration and type of antiseptic on the reduction
of resident microbial flora. Thirty-four subjects scrubbed with a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation or another
antiseptic formulation using either a 5 minute initial/3 minute consecutive scrub procedure or a 3 minute initial/30
second scrub procedure. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups, and each group was assigned to one of the four
treatments. Sampling was done by the glove juice method using a sampling solution containing a neutralizer. Glove
juice samples were taken from both hands immediately before scrubbing (baseline), from the nondominant hand immediately
after the initial scrub, 2 hours after the initial surgical scrub but before the consecutive scrub (dominant hand),
and 2 hours after one consecutive surgical scrub (dominant hand). No significant difference was found between the
two durations of scrubbing with povidone-iodine. Povidone-iodine produced an immediate 1.2 log

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

either the 5 or 3 minute scrub. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aly and Maibach (Ref. 6) evaluated the characteristics of two antimicrobial impregnated surgical hand scrub sponge/brush
drug products. The study, which included a widely used povidone-iodine impregnated surgical hand scrub sponge/brush,
evaluated both the immediate and persistent effect on the resident bacterial flora of the hands plus the effect of
blood on the persistent antimicrobial activity of the surgical hand scrub drug products. In the first phase of the
study, 13 subjects with left and right hand baseline counts of >10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 organisms were randomly assigned to perform a total of 11 scrubs with the povidone-iodine impregnated sponge/brush.
Glove juice samples were taken from the right hand of each subject immediately following the first scrub of the day
and from the left hand at either 3 or 6 hours. The entire procedure was repeated on test days 2 and 5. A similar procedure
was used in phase two of the study, except that 2 mL of bacteriologically sterile blood was spread over the hands of 6
subjects following the initial scrub, and sampling occurred only at 3 and 6 hours. Neutralizers were incorporated
into the stripping solution, diluent, and culture media. On day 1, povidone-iodine produced an immediate mean log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of 1.2, and baseline was not exceeded at 3 hours. On days 2 and 5, povidone-iodine produced immediate mean
log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively, and bacterial counts did not exceed baseline at 6 hours. While counts for
povidone-iodine approached baseline in the presence of blood, counts did not exceed baseline at 6 hours on any day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another study (Ref. 1&hyph;C104), employing a method similar to the effectiveness testing procedures described
in proposed &sect;333.470(b)(2) of this amended tentative final monograph, demonstrated the effectiveness of
povidone-iodine 5 percent as a health-care personnel handwash. Twenty-five consecutive handwashings were done
in 10 human subjects with a 5 minute rest between washings. Before each washing the hands were dipped in broth culture
containing 2.0 x 10

of every fifth washing by the glove juice sampling method. Both the dilution fluid and growth media incorporated a
neutralizer. The transient microbial flora of the hands was reduced by an average of 5.8 logs from baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dineen (Ref. 7) used a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation as a reference antiseptic in an open crossover evaluation
of a health-care personnel handwash drug product. Participation in the study followed a 1-week prewash period in
which study subjects used only a bland nonantiseptic soap. On day 1 of the study, samples were taken prior to contamination
and again after a second contamination followed by a 15-second wash with a bland nonantiseptic soap, using the glove
juice sampling method. Following the post-wash sampling, subjects washed for 5 minutes with povidone-iodine to
remove any remaining inoculum. The hands of the first three subjects were contaminated with a 1 mL inoculum containing

. Inocula concentrations were determined each test day in a parallel experiment. On days 3 or 4 and 5, the procedure
was repeated except that subjects were randomly assigned to wash with either (1) the reference antiseptic or the test
preparation or (2) were crossed over to the preparation not used the previous day. In the interim between test days,
subjects followed the wash and sampling procedure using only the nonantiseptic soap. The number of organisms included
in the 1 mL inoculum was taken as the baseline, and all reductions were calculated on this basis. Neutralizers were
incorporated in both the diluent and the culture medium. When corrected for the average log reduction produced by
the nonantiseptic soap (4-log

Studies conducted by Ulrich (Ref. 8) and Newsom and Matthews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 9) are supportive of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this indication. Ulrich (Ref. 8) conducted a study using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine 7.5 percent in 25 subjects. Both hands of each

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to air dry for 60 seconds. This artificial hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination was followed by a 15-second wash with 5 mL of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine preparation, and this same procedure was repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until 25 contaminations/washes had been performed. Glove fluid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples were taken after every fifth contamination/wash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dilutions of the glove fluid were made in a sterile diluent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a neutralizer. A neutralizer was also incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the culture medium. Based on the average of both hands, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine preparation produced a 4.9 and a 5.2 log 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of the transient micro-organisms from baseline by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5th and 10th wash, respectively. By the end of the 25th wash the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine preparation demonstrated a 5.5 log

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the baseline bacterial count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newsom and Matthews (Ref. 9) studied test solutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing 5 or 10 percent povidone-iodine on hands artificially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with an overnight culture of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of micro-organisms were measured before and immediately after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand disinfection with the test solution in 15 subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling of the hands was accomplished by kneading the fingertips 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a ``recovery'' broth that included a neutralizer. A mean 4.4 log reduction from baseline was reported for the bacterial
counts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken immediately after the antiseptic wash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ayliffe, Babb, and Quoraishi (Ref. 10) evaluated the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

fingertips. In one set of experiments, six subjects performed an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial wash with an unmedicated soap, followed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inoculation of the tips of the subjects' fingers and thumbs with

30-second wash with 5 mL of a detergent or alcoholic antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, a 30-second wash with an unmedicated soap, or no wash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at all. Bacterial sampling was accomplished by rubbing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fingers and thumbs on glass beads immersed in 100 mL of nutrient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broth containing neutralizers. All treatments were tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against each organism. Results were reported as the log of the

, povidone-iodine produced a 3.2 log reduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was significantly superior to the reduction achieved by the

In a second set of experiments (Ref. 10), the same authors assessed the effectiveness of three antiseptic formulations,
including povidone-iodine, and an unmedicated soap in the removal of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus, S. saprophyticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from contaminated fingertips. Under conditions similar to those in the previous study, povidone-iodine demonstrated
a 3-log reduction in the baseline number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which was significantly superior to the log reduction demonstrated by the unmedicated soap. Povidone-iodine produced
an average 2.1 log reduction in the number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. saprophyticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and a 2.8 reduction in the number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, neither of these reductions was significantly different from the reductions produced by the unmedicated
soap.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rotter (Ref. 11) evaluated the influence of differences in two testing methodologies on the demonstration of the
effectiveness of povidone-iodine. One test method used is the standard test method (Vienna) for the evaluation of
drug products for hygienic disinfection adopted by the Austrian and German Societies for Hygiene and Microbiology.
In this test model, the release of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the finger tips of artificially contaminated hands was determined before and after a 1-minute wash with povidone-iodine.
The second model, based on agency recommendations for the testing of health-care personnel handwashes, evaluated
the release of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from all surfaces of artificially contaminated hands by the glove juice sampling method before and after a 1 minute
wash with the ingredient. These comparisons showed no significant difference in the reduction factor produced by
povidone-iodine when tested with the two methods. Povidone-iodine when tested by the Vienna test method produced
a 3.3 log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Rotter (Ref. 11) also used the Vienna test method to assess the effectiveness of rubbing antiseptics onto the hands
versus washing with an antiseptic. Two povidone-iodine containing formulations were included in the assessment.
A watery solution of povidone-iodine with 1 percent available free iodine rubbed onto the skin produced a 4 log

a nonantiseptic soap.

Rotter, Koller, and Wewalka (Ref. 12) used the Vienna test model to assess the effectiveness of a povidone-iodine
liquid soap preparation (containing 0.75 percent available free iodine) for hygienic hand disinfection. The subjects'
hands were contaminated by immersing them up to the mid-metacarpals in a broth culture of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The hands were allowed to air dry for 3 minutes prior to a pretreatment sampling. Sampling was accomplished by rubbing
the finger tips of each hand for 1 minute on the bottom of a Petri dish containing a phosphate buffer sampling solution
with neutralizers. After a 2-minute wash with the povidone-iodine or liquid soap followed by a 20-second rinse, the
hands were again sampled. Average log values of the counts from the right and left hands of each subject were calculated,
and the difference (log reduction factor) was determined. The povidone-iodine liquid soap formulation produced
a 3.2 log

Wade and Casewell (Ref. 13) evaluated the residual effectiveness of povidone-iodine against two clinical isolates
associated with hospital outbreaks of infection. An initial determination of the survival of the test organisms
on untreated hands of three subjects was made by contaminating the subjects' finger tips with either of the test organisms
and sampling the individual fingers immediately after contamination and at 1, 3, 10, and 30 minutes. The subjects'
hands were then pretreated by performing three 30-second washes at 5 minute intervals with various alcoholic and
aqueous antiseptic test formulations, including a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation and an unmedicated
bar soap. The contamination and sampling procedure was repeated as before. All formulations were tested against
both organisms. The median value of the log counts for the three subjects as each sampling was plotted against time.
The survival curves for both organisms on hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and on hands with no
pretreatment were similar. Pretreatment with povidone-iodine resulted in counts that were consistently less than
for the untreated hands and for the hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and water for both organisms.
After 30 minutes, hands pretreated with the povidone-iodine formulation demonstrated a 2.5 log

The agency concludes that these data demonstrate the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent for use as a
health-care personnel handwash.

 studies referenced in the submitted data and in the published literature (Refs. 1 and 14 through 19) have evaluated
the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although the procedures
followed are different from those in the previous FDA testing procedures (43 FR 1210 at 1244) and from those proposed
in &sect;333.470 of this amended tentative final monograph, the essential criteria have been met.

Georgiade et al. (Ref. 15) evaluated the effectiveness of two povidone-iodine formulations for use in the preoperative
skin preparation of 150 subjects scheduled for elective surgical procedures. An initial sample for culture was taken
from the unbroken skin of the operation site prior to the use of the formulations, and a baseline bacterial count was
determined. Sampling was by a cup scrubbing method, using a sterile wash solution that incorporated a neutralizer.
The operative site was then gently treated for 5 minutes with a povidone-iodine surgical scrub formulation and allowed
to dry. Following the initial disinfection, a povidone-iodine antiseptic solution was evenly applied to the site
and allowed to dry. The sample site was rinsed with sterile water and a second sample for culture was done. Upon completion
of surgical procedures lasting from 30 to 180 minutes, the sample site was again cultured and sterile dressings were
applied. The reported mean post-scrub reduction in the baseline number of bacteria of the sample site was 30,599 (4.5

reduction of 30,613 organisms.

Vorherr, Vorherr, and Moss (Ref. 16) compared three antiseptic preparations (including 10 percent povidone-iodine),
in 150 female subjects (50 to each preparation) for effectiveness in reducing the numbers of bacteria in the perineum
and groin. The mean log reductions in bacteria after skin preparation with povidone-iodine at 10 minutes and 3 hours,
respectively, were reported as 3.65/3.09 for the perineum and 3.42/2.85 for the groin. Another study by Dzubow et
al. (Ref. 17) evaluated three antiseptic skin preparations frequently used for dermatologic surgical procedures.
A 60-second wipe with 1-percent povidone- iodine was performed in 14 subjects after which aerobic and anaerobic cultures
were taken at 5 and 60 minutes. The aerobic flora were reduced by 2.8 and 2.5 log at 5 and 60 minutes, respectively. The
reduction in anaerobic flora was reported to be 1.7 log at 5 minutes and 1.2 log at 60 minutes.

Leaper, Lewis, and Speller (Ref. 18) compared the effectiveness of povidone-iodine impregnated drapes, povidone-
iodine with a sterile drape, and conventional preoperative skin preparation with povidone-iodine for the reduction
of skin bacteria. Forty-five subjects scheduled to undergo elective groin surgery were randomized to one of the three
treatments. Impression plates and skin swabs were taken immediately before and after surgery, and swabs were taken
before and after skin incision and closure. Conventional preoperative skin prepping with povidone-iodine produced
the greatest reduction of the bacterial flora (240 colony counts to 34 colony counts, 2.3 log

Duignan and Lowe (Ref. 19) studied the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for reducing pathogenic bacteria in the
vagina. A 1:10 solution of a povidone-iodine formulation containing 0.75 percent available free iodine was instilled
into the vagina of 35 subjects and left in situ for 1 to 3 minutes. Aspirate cultures were taken from the vagina before
and after preoperative disinfection and subcultured into thioglycollate broth containing neutralizers. Povidone-iodine
removed 92 percent of the bacteroides species, anaerobic streptococci, gram negative bacilli, and

A surveillance report (Ref. 1&hyph;C132) of hospital infections showed that the use of povidone-iodine in preparing
patients for catheterization significantly reduced the rate of urinary tract infections. A 5-year study showed
that the rate of urinary tract infections before October 1977 ranged from 5.2 percent to 11.5 percent (mean 7.8 percent),
but beginning in October 1977 when povidone-iodine was the antiseptic solution in use, the rate ranged from 1.0 percent
to 4.0 percent (mean 2.4 percent). At the 95 percent confidence level this is statistically significant. No method
data accompanied the report except that the urethral meatus was cleansed with cotton dipped in the antiseptic solution
before catheterization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that these studies and other published and publicly available medical and scientific data demonstrate
that povidone-iodine is effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although all of the trials
were not done the same way, and thus they are not strictly comparable, the weight of the evidence shows that povidone-iodine
is effective both as a preoperative skin preparation and surgical hand scrub, reducing the normal microbial flora
by more than 90 percent and not showing any significant qualitative selection among the normal species found on the
skin. In conclusion, povidone-iodine was effective against a wide spectrum of pathogenic and normal skin micro-organisms
and maintained some suppressive effect on skin counts after the initial use. In addition to the data reviewed supporting
the safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine for these professional uses, the agency classified povidone-iodine
5 to 10 percent as Category I as a first aid antiseptic in the tentative final monograph published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). Accordingly, the agency is reclassifying povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent from Category
III to Category I for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin
preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. Several comments objected to the agency's proposal that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the professional labeling of povidone-iodine products containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecules greater than 35,000 daltons should include warnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against parenteral use and against exposure of open surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds or deep wounds to the product. (See comment 71, 43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1210 at 1221.) Some of the comments contended that the Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended such warnings because it felt there was widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misuse (unapproved use) of povidone-iodine solution by surgeons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bathing the peritoneal cavity with povidone-iodine during major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgery and then cleansing the area by rinsing. Another comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that because health-care personnel handwashes or surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrubs require a surfactant, such products so formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would never be considered for peritoneal lavage by surgeons. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment argued that labeling to warn against parenteral use is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly beyond the scope of the OTC drug review and FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authority. Another comment stated that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary to establish an arbitrary molecular weight limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine because no parenteral use of povidone-iodine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted in any of the approved labeling in the new drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for those products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that povidone-iodine is generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized as safe and effective for use in open wounds and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning against such use would be contrary to clinical experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this drug. In support of this position, the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted a controlled study in which the surgical incisions of one group were irrigated before closure with 10 percent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine solution, and the surgical incisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control group were irrigated before closure with saline solution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1). The comment stated that the results of this study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed a significant decrease in infections when povidone-iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was used, and there were no allergic, adverse, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleterious effects following this use of povidone-iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Commissioner's recommendation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research data (43 FR 1210 at 1235), one comment submitted an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive review of the extent of scavenging of residual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine molecules by the reticuloendothelial system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible lymph node involvement following use in the abdominal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cavity or in large wounds (Ref. 2). The comment stated that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on these data, povidone-iodine with medium molecular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weights should not be limited to use on intact skin, nor should a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning be required. Another comment stated that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weight of povidone in the povidone-iodine that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used exclusively in topical antimicrobial products for almost a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter of a century is 37,900 daltons, and it presents no risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any of the topical antimicrobial uses covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel recognized a relationship between molecular size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nodular lymphatic changes accompanying exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine, but made no decision on limiting the molecular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size causing such pathology. (See 39 FR 33103 at 33130.) In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous tentative final monograph, FDA evaluated data provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a comment (Ref. 3) that contended there should be restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the use of povidone-iodine according to molecular size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Published research cited in that comment indicated that povidone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecules larger than 40,000 daltons cannot be excreted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kidneys, can cause nodules to appear in the lymphatic system, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may induce cosmetic deformities in the area of healing skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds. Based on expert opinion and the data provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment (Ref. 3), the agency proposed that a molecular weight of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35,000 daltons be established as the safe upper limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine products used parenterally. This calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that a povidone-iodine molecule with this molecular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight would be too large to pass through the kidney. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 71, 43 FR 1210 at 1221.) FDA also noted its awareness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the inappropriate use of povidone-iodine products in open wounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the abdominal cavity during surgery. (See 43 FR 1235.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To promote proper use of povidone-iodine products, FDA proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to recognize two categories of such products. Products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine molecular weights less than 35,000 daltons would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be permitted for general use. Appropriate labeling would place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each product in its proper category of use. The professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of povidone-iodine products containing molecules greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 35,000 daltons would also include warnings against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parenteral use of, and exposure of open surgical wounds or deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds to, the product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this current tentative final monograph, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that the professional uses of povidone-iodine that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed as safe and effective are limited to a patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, health-care personnel handwash, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and surgical hand scrub. Further examination of the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited in the previous tentative final monograph (Ref. 3) reveals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the reported adverse effects were due to intravenous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parenteral use of povidone. Based on the more recent data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the agency now believes that neither medium nor larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weight povidone-iodine molecules present risks when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the topical uses included in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. Larger molecules of povidone-iodine would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorbed if the drug is used for these professional uses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the monograph. Thus, there is no need for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional labeling to limit the molecular weight of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine products or to require special warnings related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. Accordingly, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling is not being included in this tentative final monograph.

19. Several comments contended that there are numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional uses for povidone-iodine, particularly uses that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve medical devices, that were not discussed by the Panel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the agency in the tentative final monograph. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional uses include catheter care, ostomy hygiene, patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping, surgical site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleansing after stitching, mouth and throat swabbing, treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the skin before covering a fracture with a cast, antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of various scalp problems, and intravenous site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. One comment added that a pharmacist or other health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional may recommend the use of povidone-iodine as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
douche, perianal wash, or whirlpool concentrate. The comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that special labeling be added to the monograph to cover all of these uses, but did not submit data regarding
these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment also provided professional labeling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine used for urinary or intravenous catheter care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. The suggested labeling included the following terms: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``antiseptic,'' ``germicide,'' ``microbicidal,'' and ``for hospital and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the professional uses mentioned by the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not covered by this rulemaking, but they will be addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under other OTC drug rulemakings. For example, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine for mouth and throat swabbing is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC oral health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 25, 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 22760). The use of povidone-iodine for the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scalp problems is addressed in the final rule for OTC dandruff, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products, published in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63554). The use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of povidone-iodine as a douche is addressed in the advance notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug products, published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Hemorrhoidal Drug Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the inclusion of antiseptics in OTC anorectal drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products ``is useful in concept,'' but ``that proof of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant clinical benefit of claimed antiseptic ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be demonstrated in clinical trials'' (45 FR 35576 at 35659). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That Panel believed that, because of the large numbers of micro-organisms present in feces, there is little likelihood
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective antisepsis could be obtained in the anorectal area with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics any more than with soap and water. Because no data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were submitted on povidone-iodine as a perianal wash, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not address this ingredient in the discussion of antiseptics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the tentative final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the agency evaluated the Panel's conclusions. Similarly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ingredient was not included in the final rule for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anorectal drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 3, 1990 (55 FR 31766). Parties interested in this use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine can submit data and information as part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizen petition to amend the final rule for OTC anorectal drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. (See 21 CFR 10.30.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the uses suggested by the comments are related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general category of patient preoperative skin preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was discussed by the Panel. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 13, 1974, 39 FR 33103 and 33114.) One example is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use ``patient skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency believes that this use can more simply be described by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication ``for preparation of the skin prior to surgery,'' which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is being proposed in &sect;333.460(b)(1)(i) of this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. Other uses are catheter care, ostomy hygiene, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intravenous site preparation. Some uses mentioned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments involve postoperative situations (surgical site cleansing after stitching) or do not even involve a surgical

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure (treatment of skin prior to covering a fracture with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cast or use as a whirlpool concentrate). The agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that instead of trying to identify in the product's labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every possible situation where use of the product would reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of skin infection, this use of the product can best be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by the general indication ``Helps to reduce bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that potentially can cause skin infection,'' which is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in &sect;333.460(b)(1)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the term ``for hospital and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use only'' suggested by one comment and finds it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable for professional labeling. (See section I.D., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.) Likewise, the agency has no objection to terms such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``germicide,'' ``germicidal,'' and ``microbicidal'' being used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional labeling because health professionals understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of these terms. However, the agency does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a need to include in the monograph every one of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms that might be used in the professional labeling of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. These terms will be evaluated by the agency on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product-by-product basis, under the provision of section 502 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading.

20. One comment requested that benzalkonium chloride be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in Category I as a skin antiseptic, a patient preoperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin preparation, and a skin wound protectant, in addition to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present Category I classification as a skin wound cleanser. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of its request, the comment cited several surgery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
textbooks and other references that recommend use of benzalkonium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride at concentrations ranging from 1:750 to 1:5,000 as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, surgical scrub, skin antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for venipuncture, and in urinary tract procedures, especially in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catheterized patients (Ref. 1). The comment also submitted two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies on a product containing benzalkonium chloride at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of 1:1,000: (1) An in vitro study to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this product formulation acts as a physical chemical barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against contamination by micro-organisms, and (2) a study on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
induced wounds on the arms of 10 healthy subjects to present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that this product is nonirritating and neither delays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
healing nor favors the growth of micro-organisms (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency determined in the tentative final monograph for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that the safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective concentration range for using benzalkonium chloride as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a first aid antiseptic has been established as 0.1 percent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.13 percent. (See 56 FR 33644 and 33663.) Data submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel and by the comment were sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish safety for products intended for short-term use, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a first aid antiseptic drug product. The data submitted also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support safety for use as a patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, based on the short-term use of the drug for this purpose. However, the data reviewed by the Panel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemented by the comments to establish the efficacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzalkonium chloride for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in patient preoperative skin preparations are not sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Antimicrobial I Panel placed this ingredient in Category III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this use. (See 39 FR 33103 and 33115.) The agency finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surgery textbooks and other references cited by the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1) do not contain sufficient information about quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and qualitative changes in the microbial flora of the treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin areas. Before benzalkonium chloride may be generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarded as effective for use as a patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, additional in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are needed. The data should include results obtained from both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See section I.N., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 28.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, benzalkonium chloride remains classified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation.

21. Two comments objected to the proposed warning statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;333.92(c)(6) for concentrated products containing quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds, which states, ``Dilute with distilled water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before use because acidic or hard water may render the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inactive.'' One comment contended that this proposed warning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prejudicial to the quaternary ammonium products that can act in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acidic or hard water and noted that the existence of quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds that can act as antimicrobials in acidic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hard water was recognized in the tentative final monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(43 FR 1210 at 1219). The comment recommended that the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of products containing quaternary ammonium compounds include a statement, based on appropriate laboratory tests,
about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the product to perform in acidic solutions and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of water hardness (described as parts per million (ppm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calcium carbonate) in which the product will continue to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comment stated that several concentrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 50 percent benzalkonium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride, U.S.P.) registered with the Environmental Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency (EPA) conform with the hard-water tolerance requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore can maintain activity at a water-hardness level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 ppm. The comment also stated that pH must be reduced below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.5 before the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreased to any significant extent (Ref. 1). The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that, because normal potable water supplies do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach these levels for either hardness or acidity, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in proposed &sect;333.92(c)(6) for diluting only with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled water is inappropriate and needless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency acknowledged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that hard water and acidity reduce the antimicrobial activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds, but that there are some newer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synthesized quaternary ammonium compounds that are not adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by hard water and acidity (43 FR 1210 at 1218, 1219, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1236). However, these newer quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a mixture of three benzalkonium halide compounds with varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain lengths), while structurally related to benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and methylbenzethonium
chloride 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the quaternary ammonium compounds which the Antimicrobial I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel reviewed and which the agency proposed as Category III), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not reviewed or categorized by the Panel or the agency and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not included in this rulemaking. (See comment 58, 43 FR 1210 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 1219.) Further, the agency notes that the 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium concentrates that conform with EPA standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are intended for germicidal uses and not for the antiseptic uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are being considered in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is aware that studies have shown that effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acidic water on quaternary ammonium compounds occur only at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilutions containing less than the dosage concentration proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the tentative final monograph (Ref. 2). Higher concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize quaternary ammonium compound inactivation due to pH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change (Ref. 3). However, it is well known that natural water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies in different areas differ in acidity and hardness. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precautionary measure, FDA believes that concentrates of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients considered in this rulemaking should be diluted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled water by consumers and health-care professionals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because information about water pH or hardness in any given area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not usually known. Diluting the concentrated quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compound products addressed in this rulemaking with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled water ensures that inactivating factors are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encountered. Therefore, the agency proposes to retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement, ``Dilute with distilled water before use because acidic or hard water may render the product inactive,''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for diluting any Category I quaternary ammonium concentrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because all the quaternary ammonium compounds remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III at this time, the warning statement is not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this tentative final monograph.

K. Comment on Sodium Oxychlorosene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. One comment requested that sodium oxychlorosene be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the monograph for use as a topical antiseptic for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating localized infections, to remove necrotic debris in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
massive infections, as a patient preoperative skin preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and postoperative irrigant, and for the cleansing and disinfection of fistulae, sinus tracts, empyemas, and wounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment included a number of references that recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usage of sodium oxychlorosene (Ref. 1). The comment stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* the 25 years of marketing experience, the almost total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of complaints, the number of published articles, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unusual spectrum of organisms reported on, all attest to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and efficacy of this product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the data submitted and concludes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the available information does not contain any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxychlorosene. In addition, no meaningful scientific information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was presented in regard to safety. Clinical use for a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years may provide corroborative evidence but is inadequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support safe use. A good example is hexachlorophene; this drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been used OTC for many years before more thorough safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies in animals showed that the drug was not as safe as had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been assumed. The agency concludes that the data are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium oxychlorosene for OTC topical antiseptic use and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places this ingredient in Category III for both safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's detailed evaluation of the data and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 2).

L. Comments on Triclosan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. A number of comments submitted data and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from microbiological, mutagenicity, metabolism, cross-sensitization, photo-sensitization, and drug experience
studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on triclosan (Ref. 1). The comments stated that the data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information show that triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) is safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective and that triclosan should be placed in Category I for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in the categories that were defined in the previous tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph, i.e., skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wound protectant, antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrub. In addition, one comment submitted information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triclosan (0.1 percent) for the treatment of diaper rash and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triclosan (0.1 percent) combined with benzocaine for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of sunburn (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment from the manufacturer of triclosan objected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency's expressed concern, as stated in the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1231 and 1233), that there is a proliferation of products containing triclosan marketed to
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American consumer (Ref. 3). The comment argued that the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns were without factual basis and submitted sales data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held confidential under 21 CFR 10.20(j)(2)(i)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), showing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall sales of triclosan in the U.S. have in fact decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 1973 to 1977 and that sales for use in bar soaps and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deodorants have also declined from 1973 to 1977. The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out that it has exclusive U.S. patent rights for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triclosan and that no license has been, or will be, granted under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these patents. The comment added that to the best of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge triclosan is not used in infant clothing, a use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned in the tentative final monograph at 43 FR 1231. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment stated that if triclosan is placed in Category I for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in antimicrobial soaps, it would limit sales of triclosan to OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in antimicrobial and deodorant soaps, underarm deodorants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and registered Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. In the future, sales might be extended to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved new drug applications. The comment also pointed out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the statement at 43 FR 1233 about the EPA's Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Pesticide Review preparing a report on the proliferation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of triclosan-containing products is in error, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous statement apparently resulted from a miscommunication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between FDA and EPA staff. The comment concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns about proliferation raised by the agency in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph should not prevent triclosan from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in Category I.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment from the manufacturer of triclosan submitted validation reports and raw data from a 2-year chronic
oral toxicity study in rats, and carcinogenicity and reproduction studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and
monkeys by Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT) (Refs. 4, 5, and 6) and asserted that its validation of the studies
shows that triclosan is safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments objected to the agency's restriction at 43 FR 1229 that antimicrobial soaps containing triclosan
can only be formulated in a bar soap to be used with water (Ref. 1). The comments argued that such a restriction was not
applied to the other Category III uses of triclosan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant, and that such a restriction was not recommended
by the Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The comments suggested that the footnote under ``antimicrobial
soaps'' limiting triclosan to bar soap was probably intended to apply to cloflucarban, which, like triclocarban,
is known for its ``physical and/or chemical incompatibility.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to safety, the agency evaluated the validation reports to support long-term use of the ingredient (Refs.
4, 5, and 6) and advised the manufacturer of triclosan that the IBT studies were invalid because of numerous problems.
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer subsequently stated its intent to no longer rely on the 2-year chronic oral toxicity IBT study (Ref.
8), and submitted a final report from a new 2-year chronic oral toxicity study in rats (Ref. 9). The agency has determined
that the study data are unacceptable as the sole evidence of the safety of the long-term use of triclosan as a health-care
personnel handwash or surgical handscrub based on the marginal survival of the animals in both the control and treated
groups and uncertainties about the dose and study conduct. Therefore, data from another chronic exposure study are
necessary to assess the safety of the long-term use of triclosan. The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of
the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 10). A subsequent submission from the same manufacturer
contained the final report of a two-generation study of the reproductive toxicity of triclosan in rats (Ref. 11).
These data are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products.
Triclosan remains classified as Category III for safety for long-term use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644
at 33665) that triclosan (in concentrations up to 1.0 percent) is safe for short term use as a first aid antiseptic (formerly
designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The data reviewed (Ref. 1) also support
the safety of triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, with regard
to safety for use as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub, triclosan
remains classified in Category III for safety for long-term use, as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to effectiveness, in the previous tentative final monograph the agency classified triclosan as Category
II for use as a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub because
triclosan has limited activity against gram-negative bacteria. For example, triclosan is the subject of a patent
(patent No. 3,616,256) for use in culture media for isolating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because human skin is regarded as a superb ``culture medium,'' the possibility was raised (43 FR 1210 at 1232) that
triclosan might selectively promote overgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on the hands of health-care personnel. Based upon data reviewed, the agency advised that in vitro data demonstrate
that triclosan's antibacterial spectrum can be broadened, to be effective against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when triclosan is properly formulated with anionic surfactants to form a ``synergistic mixture.'' Therefore, FDA
reclassified triclosan (up to 1.0 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) from Category II to Category III
for effectiveness. The agency further advised that additional studies are needed before triclosan can be generally
recognized as effective for specific uses, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, surgical hand scrub, health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and first aid uses
(formerly designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The agency's detailed
comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 12).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the agency's comments (Ref. 12), the manufacturer of triclosan requested further guidance, and asserted,
``The overall antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a function of the total formulation
rather than a single ingredient. Although it is impossible to anticipate and test all possible formulations, adequate
in vivo evaluations of triclosan-containing formulations for specific end uses are available to fully justify Category
I status for triclosan as an active ingredient in surgical hand scrubs, health-care personnel handwashes, and antimicrobial
soaps.'' The comment submitted effectiveness data from four in vivo studies on formulations of triclosan (Ref. 13).
These data included three previously unsubmitted studies (RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981), RDP/19/21 (February 2, 1981),
and CAB/AVD (February 2, 1982)), and one previously submitted study (66&hyph;D15&hyph;W221, OTC Volume 020038)
that had been reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33128). In study 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, following modified glove juice test procedures, a test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol)
and a control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) were compared for reduction of normal baseline flora and persistence
of that reduction for 3 hours on the hands of 15 test subjects. The test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent
n-propyl alcohol) and the control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) immediately reduced approximately 99.5 percent
of the baseline number of bacteria. After 3 hours, 0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol suppressed
the baseline count better than the vehicle control; for example the test product allowed about a onefold increase
in bacterial count within 3 hours, while the vehicle control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) allowed an approximately
twelvefold increase. Although the test used was not the glove juice test described in the antimicrobial tentative
final monograph, alternative methods are acceptable, provided criteria meet those of the glove juice test procedures
described in the guidelines. (See ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test),'' 43 FR 1210
at 1242.) The agency has the following comments regarding the protocol for the study: only 15 subjects (an insufficient
number) were tested; a baseline count from 3 samplings was not established before the test; the log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in bacteria from baseline was determined after 3 hours, but not after 6 hours; and the results of the test
were not analyzed statistically.

 soap without triclosan, as a control, to show reduction of baseline counts on the hands of five human test subjects
after 5 days. Using the Quinn Split-Use Modification of the Price-Cade Method, increased skin-degerming activity
was shown after 3 days of repeated (10) applications of triclosan as compared to the control. However, the number of
test subjects (5) is not adequate to demonstrate general recognition of effectiveness. (See the ``Modified Cade
Procedure,'' 43 FR 1210 at 1243.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the data (Ref. 13) discussed above indicate that formulations of triclosan significantly
reduce the baseline count of bacterial skin flora. However, before triclosan may be generally recognized as an effective
health-care antiseptic for use in antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative
skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products, additional in vivo data, i.e., glove juice test data, are
needed. The in vivo data should correlate with data obtained from in vitro studies. Because of the nature of the intended
uses of health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency believes it is essential to assure the effectiveness of
the active ingredient, triclosan, in final formulations. To demonstrate effectiveness in vitro, information is
needed on the germicidal activity of the vehicle alone, so that the germicidal contribution of triclosan attributed
to the total effectiveness of the finished formulation can be determined. (See section I.N., comment 28.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, triclosan (up to 1 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) is being classified as Category III
for use in health-care antiseptic drug products as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash
or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub. The agency's conclusions are summarized below:

The agency has communicated further with EPA and has ascertained that there is no specific report on the proliferation
of triclosan (Ref. 14). Regarding exclusive patent rights, the agency advises that these are not among the determining
criteria to establish general recognition of safety and effectiveness, and therefore cannot be used in the evaluation.
However, having reviewed the new data along with the previously submitted data, the agency concludes that there is
no proliferation problem with triclosan.

Finally, the agency did not intend to restrict formulations of triclosan to bar soap. The agency has reviewed the Panel's
recommendations and the footnotes in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1229) and finds that triclosan
under ``antimicrobial soaps'' was erroneously marked with the reference to the footnote ``Category III only when
formulated in a bar soap to be used with water.''

The use of triclosan in products for the treatment of diaper rash was discussed in the tentative final monograph for
antimicrobial diaper rash drug products published on June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246 at 25277 to 25278). The use of triclosan
in products for treating sunburn will be addressed in the

M. Comments on Combinations of Active Ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24. One comment stated that the Panel did not review safety and effectiveness data submitted to it on mercufenol chloride
(orthohydroxyphenylmercuric chloride) 0.1 percent and secondary amyltricresols 0.1 percent as single ingredients
and in combination for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, and skin wound protectant
(Ref. 1). The comment added that the agency did not discuss these ingredients alone or in combination in the previous
tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment asserted that secondary amyltricresols, mentioned in the previous tentative final monograph under
phenol (43 FR 1210 at 1238), is not equivalent to phenol because of chemical differences and differing antimicrobial
properties, formulation concentrations, and patterns of use. The comment requested the agency to make decisions
on the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient when used alone, or in combination, as a patient preoperative skin
preparation, a skin antiseptic, or a skin wound protectant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has previously reviewed data for first aid antiseptic uses of 0.1 percent mercufenol chloride and 0.1 percent
secondary amyltricresols and found the evidence insufficient to support their safety and effectiveness either
as single ingredients or in combination (56 FR 33644 at 33668). Only safety data on animals were submitted by the comment
(Ref. 1); in general, these studies were conducted on a very small number of animals, did not detail methodology, and
did not adequately describe results (physical condition of the animals). The submitted in vitro studies also lack
sufficient detail to establish the effectiveness of mercufenol chloride.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Secondary amyltricresols is a mixture of isomeric secondary amyltricresols, which are derivatives of phenol, and
has pharmacological properties similar to phenol. The agency agrees with the comment that the mixture of secondary
amyltricresols is not equivalent to phenol and should be categorized separately from phenol. The submitted safety
data included a study by Broom (Ref. 2), who reported that amylmetacresol is relatively nontoxic and less toxic than
hexylresorcinol in rats and mice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No toxicity studies in humans were included in the information provided by the comment. However, in the tentative
final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852 at 5858), the agency proposed that metacresol up to a 3.6-percent concentration be considered
safe when combined with camphor and that a 3-to-1 ratio of camphor to metacresol reduces the irritating properties
of metacresol. Although cresols may cause some irritation when applied to minor wounds, the agency believes that
secondary amyltricresols at the concentration requested (0.1 percent) would not present any safety concerns, particularly
considering the short-term use of antiseptics as patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. The submitted
data are, however, inadequate to establish the efficacy of secondary amyltricresols. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data are also needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary
amyltricresols. Only animal safety data are available, and these studies were limited to determinations of the minimum
lethal dose by various routes of administration (Ref. 1). The submitted information on marketing history is not sufficient
to provide general recognition of the safety of these ingredients. The data contained isolated reports of the combination
of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols causing occasional skin irritation, such as burning and blistering
(Ref. 1), adverse effects that need to be more fully studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the effectiveness work on the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols has been in
vitro. The combination is reported to combine the antibacterial activity of the single ingredients, that is, mercufenol
chloride which is primarily active against gram-negative organisms and secondary amyltricresols which is primarily
active against gram-positive organisms (Ref. 3). One in vivo study on the effectiveness of the combination as a patient
preoperative skin preparation showed a substantial reduction in the skin microflora (Ref. 4). However, because
neutralizers were not used, bacteriocidal activity cannot be differentiated from residual bacteriostatic activity.
In addition, the effect of the 50-percent alcohol in the alcohol-acetone vehicle was not taken into consideration.
Alcohol, 60 to 95 percent, is in Category I for antiseptic health-care uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the agency's guidelines for OTC drug combination products (Ref. 5), Category I active ingredients from the
same therapeutic category that have different mechanisms of action may be combined to treat the same symptoms or condition
if the combination meets the OTC combination policy in all respects and the combination is on a benefit-risk basis,
equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at its therapeutic dose. Accordingly, both mercufenol
chloride and secondary amyltricresols and the combination of these ingredients are placed in Category III. The combination
needs further testing of the combined ingredients compared to each individual active ingredient to establish effectiveness
of the combination as a patient preoperative skin preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recommends that in vivo and in vitro effectiveness data be submitted. The data should be based on both in
vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See
section I.N., comment 28.)

25. One comment submitted data on a combination drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product containing calomel (mercurous chloride) 30 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxyquinoline benzoate, and trolamine (triethanolamine) combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with fatty acids to form a soap compound, plus a phenol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative that is currently marketed over-the-counter and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated for use in the prevention of venereal disease (syphilis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gonorrhea) (Ref. 1). The comment included a historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and information on in vitro activity of one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients. According to the comment, in 1905 the discovery was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made that calomel in combination with fats is an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
germicide against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Treponema pallidum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. pallidum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the causative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism of syphilis. Later, calomel was stated to be active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (the causative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism of gonorrhea). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This combination of ingredients and the indication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea have not been reviewed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any OTC advisory review panel. However, because a claim is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating antimicrobial activity and the product contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calomel, which is already included in the rulemaking for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial drug products, the agency believes it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to review this combination and labeling claim in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The in vitro effectiveness test described in the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1) is a zone of inhibition test comparing the germicidal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity of calomel, phenol, and organic silver salts against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as an indicator of activity against syphilis (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pallidum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and gonorrhea (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). According to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission, the causative organisms are not viable in vitro and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not used in the testing. The agency points out that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible to isolate and subculture isolates of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in vitro antimicrobial testing (Ref. 2), but 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. pallidum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be grown in vitro (Ref. 3). The agency does not consider the in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vitro test against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be adequate to support a claim of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate rulemaking for mercury-containing drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for topical antimicrobial use, calomel was reviewed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 436 at 440). That Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did note that calomel ``has been used in the past by inunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(rubbing into the skin) as a prophylactic against venereal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease *&blank;*&blank;*'' but placed the ingredient in Category II because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``calomel may be safe as a topical antimicrobial agent, but it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not effective for this purpose.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is apparent that calomel 30 percent would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered an active ingredient, it is not clear from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information whether the other ingredients in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination (oxyquinoline benzoate, trolamine, and phenol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative) are also considered active ingredients, nor are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of these other ingredients stated in the submission and no data have been submitted to the OTC drug
review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these ingredients in relation to the prevention of venereal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease. In the absence of any data, none of these ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered safe and effective for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment did not submit any in vivo data from clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies to demonstrate that the combination of calomel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxyquinoline benzoate, trolamine, and phenol derivative is safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and effective for use in the prevention of syphilis and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gonorrhea. Preliminary in vitro testing against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be conducted before any human clinical trials are done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Then, favorable results from two well-controlled clinical studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in humans conducted by qualified investigators in two geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations (at least one should be within the United States of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
America) are needed before any drug product can be recognized to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be safe and effective in preventing syphilis and gonorrhea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested individuals should consult with the agency before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiating any testing. In conclusion, the agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this combination of ingredients indicated for the prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of syphilis and gonorrhea be classified Category II in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Panel's proposed testing guidelines (43 FR 1210 at 1239 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1240), the agency's statements on final formulation testing (43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 1211, 1224, and 1240), and specific protocols for upgrading an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial ingredient from Category III to Category I (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1242 to 1246). Stating that the testing guidelines were unclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in some places and pointing out inconsistencies between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines and the agency's responses to comments at 43 FR 1211 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1223 to 1227, a number of comments requested clarification or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed modifications of a number of items in the guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments requested specific information or submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocols for testing Category III ingredients. One comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that manufacturers be permitted to determine which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol to follow to establish safety or effectiveness of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. A number of comments objected to the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the testing guidelines as final, and urged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions in the guidelines for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency acknowledges that there were some inconsistencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the previous tentative final rule. The agency does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the previous testing guidelines as final. The agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifying in this amended tentative final monograph that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final formulations will be required to meet the specifications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final monograph. As stated in section I.N., comment 28, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing testing procedures in &sect;333.470 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the active ingredient in pure form as well as in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete formulation. The agency recommends that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use these procedures for testing the final formulations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products intended for health-care antiseptic use. Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may propose other appropriate testing procedures subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency evaluation, as requested. The data from these tests are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required to be submitted to FDA by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency intends to use these procedures for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary compliance testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Two comments pointed out an apparent conflict in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's statements concerning safety factor calculations as follows: At 43 FR 1240, the agency concluded that a
minimum of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100-fold safety factor should apply to the exposure dose for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients labeled for repeated daily use; at 43 FR 1241, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency stated that if the safety factor is extrapolated from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal species to man, considering surface area, the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no-effect dose should be used for the multiplier, and in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of complete data, a 100-fold safety factor should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied when translating the animal highest no-effect dose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
man; and at 43 FR 1213 (see comment 19), the agency stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications of the safety factor will be allowed for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment suggested that a safety factor of less than 100-fold be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable when scientific investigation of good quality shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the test animals used in establishing the no-effect dose are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to humans with respect to metabolism (biotransformation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pharmacokinetics) and/or tissue susceptibility. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment stated that a more reasoned and practical approach would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be to require calculation of certain safety factors as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended, and indicate in a general guideline that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk-benefit ratios based on these factors would determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative merits of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not find any conflict in the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements included in the previous tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety factor calculations were included merely as a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideline. The agency's response to comment 19 at 43 FR 1213 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the agency would retain a minimum of a 100-fold safety factor applied to the exposure dose for ingredients
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products labeled for repeated daily use. However, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will consider modifications of the safety factor for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where requests are based on submitted data. While the 100-fold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety factor was a general guideline in the previous tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph, the agency does not find a need to include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general guideline in this amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. Numerous comments requested clarification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria required to establish effectiveness for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial product class. One comment stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Testing Guidelines'' section seems to indicate that it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to determine the effect of the vehicle on the active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. The comment contended that this provision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusing because the preamble discussion in the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph indicates that vehicle testing will not be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* where adequate data are available on the active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients alone.'' (See 43 FR 1210 at 1224.) Another comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the Cade handwashing test can only be conducted if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the antimicrobial is placed in a vehicle and noted that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial is never used by consumers in its raw form; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, efficacy testing on the raw antimicrobial ingredient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be required. A third comment stated that the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of the total formulation rather than a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. Another comment added that if an individual product formulation must be tested, and/or the testing of
a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle is considered essential, then such testing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be specifically described. Citing the definition of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic in section 201(o) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)), one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment asserted that the definition requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial product kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms on the skin. The comment proposed that efficacy
can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by showing that the preparation produces a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative reduction in the levels of normal skin flora and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhibition of bacterial growth in vitro. Two comments pointed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out that the ``Modified Cade Procedure'' handwashing test (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1210 at 1243) specifies a one-log reduction of bacteria, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure fails to indicate how many uses or days of use of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product should produce the reduction. Other comments requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no upper limit be set for bacterial hand counts, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower limit of 1.5&times;106 per hand be the only criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject selection, and that minimal hand count reduction be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the test protocols for surgical hand scrub and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash products. Another comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that modification of the ``Sampling technique and times'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(paragraph 6) of the protocol ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test)'' (43 FR 1243) was needed because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protocol did not indicate the volume of sampling solution but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only stated that the volume *&blank;*&blank;* should be ``kept constant'' for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all tests. The comment recommended that the agency specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of 50 to 100 mL of sampling solution in order to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent and reproducible results.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully reviewed the comments, existing data, and other information, and is clarifying the effectiveness
criteria for health-care antiseptics in this tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for an antiseptic ingredient to be generally recognized as effective for use as an antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and/or surgical hand scrub, it must have
existing data from well designed clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness. The agency believes that it is important
to correlate effectiveness data from clinical studies with effectiveness data from in vitro studies on the activity
of the vehicle and active ingredient individually, so that the germicidal contribution of the antiseptic ingredient
to the total formulation can be fully characterized. As stated in the testing guidelines in the previous tentative
final monograph, at 43 FR 1240, ``*&blank;*&blank;* there should be demonstration that the formulated product is
better than the vehicle alone. Testing of the complete formulation of Category III ingredients *&blank;*&blank;*
is necessary to judge the importance of the vehicle in the release of the active ingredient as well as the influence
of formulation on aspects of effectiveness *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The agency believes that information on the in
vitro activity of the active ingredient alone helps to characterize its antiseptic activity independent of formulation
and helps to further define formulation effects on the antimicrobial ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing
that in vitro studies of the antimicrobial activity of health-care antiseptic drug products covered by &sect;333.470(a)(1)(i)
and (a)(1)(ii) be conducted on the active ingredient, the vehicle, and the final formulation. Manufacturers are
to have such data in their files for products containing ingredients included in the monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is proposing that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the
antiseptic ingredient, the vehicle, and the formulated product be characterized by the determination of their antimicrobial
spectrum and by minimal inhibitory concentration determinations performed against selected organisms using methodology
established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratories Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Because the principal
intended use of these health-care antiseptic drug products is the prevention of nosocomial or hospital acquired
infections, the agency concludes that these products should be able to demonstrate in vitro activity against a microbial
spectrum that reflects this use. Since 1970, the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) has collected
and analyzed data on nosocomial pathogens reported to the Centers for Disease Control by a number of hospitals who
perform prospective surveillance on nosocomial infections. These data provide an indication of the most frequently
occurring pathogens at four major sites of nosocomial infection_the urinary tract, surgical wounds, lungs (pneumonia),
and bloodstream. The agency believes that health-care personnel handwash, surgical hand scrub, and patient preoperative
skin preparations should be able to demonstrate in vitro effectiveness against these pathogens as well as the normal
resident skin flora. Therefore, the agency is proposing that micro-organisms associated with the most commonly
occurring nosocomial infections and those found most often in nosocomial infections of high risk patients as reported
by the NNIS, for the period from January 1985 through August 1988 (Ref. 2), be included in the list of micro-organisms
to be tested in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). The agency further concludes that this proposed list identifies a broad
spectrum of antimicrobial activity that is also appropriate for home use antiseptic handwash products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that neither filamentous dermatophytic fungi or viruses are included in the NNIS report. More recent
studies (Refs. 3 and 4) have reported small numbers of nosocomial infections associated with both of these organisms.
However, the new studies do not provide sufficient information to assess the relative importance of these organisms
as a cause of nosocomial infection. Therefore, the agency is not proposing to include filamentous dermatophytic
fungi in the list of micro-organisms to be tested, as proposed in the previous in vitro effectiveness testing guidelines
(43 FR 1210 at 1241) and is continuing to propose that viruses also not be included. The agency recognizes that the list
of organisms to be tested may need updating to assure that it remains reflective of current trends in the microbial
etiology of nosocomial infections. The agency intends to update the list as new information becomes available. Further,
the agency invites the submission of comments and specifically data on the role of other organisms, particularly
viruses and filamentous dermatophytic fungi, in nosocomial infections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the characterization of the in vitro spectrum of activity, the agency believes that information on
how rapidly these antimicrobial drug products achieve their antimicrobial effect is necessary. As a means of indicating
how quickly these products achieve their antimicrobial effect, the agency is proposing in vitro time-kill curves
of the formulated drug product as part of the testing requirements. The agency acknowledges that there is currently
no accepted or standardized method that may be used in conducting this type of study and invites the submission of proposed
methods that may be considered as applicable to this test. In &sect;333.470(a)(1)(iv) of the proposed testing regulations,
the agency provides guidance on the development of such methods. However, any time-kill studies submitted to the
agency are to be conducted on a 10-fold dilution of the formulated product against the ATCC strains identified in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii)
of the proposed testing regulations and are to include enumeration at times at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 30 minutes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to proof of clinical effectiveness, the agency is proposing specific criteria for final formulations
of antiseptic handwashes or health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical
hand scrubs that are based on the recommendations of the Panel and agency experience in evaluating the effectiveness
of these types of drug products, as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash products, the agency is proposing the following criteria:
(1) A 2-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the first wash and (2) a 3-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the tenth wash, when tested by a modification
of the standard procedure for the evaluation of health-care personnel handwash formulations published by the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (Ref. 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For patient preoperative skin preparations, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 2-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of an abdominal test site, (2) a 3-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of a groin test site within 10 minutes from a matched control
area, and (3) the suppression of bacterial growth below baseline for 6 hours, when tested by a modification of the standard
procedure for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparations published by the ASTM (Ref. 6). The agency
believes that the revised effectiveness criteria more closely reflect the conditions of product use, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, on a number of different body sites, each supporting different numbers of resident skin flora. In addition, although
persistence of effect was not recommended by the Panel as a requirement for these drug products, the agency believes
that persistence of antimicrobial effect would suppress the growth of residual skin flora not removed by preoperative
prepping as well as transient micro-organisms inadvertently added to the operative field during the course of surgery
and reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Based on the proposed effectiveness criteria for this product class,
the agency is proposing a revised definition of a patient preoperative skin preparation drug product in &sect;333.403(c)(2)
of this amended tentative final monograph as follows: ``A fast-acting broad-spectrum persistent antiseptic-containing
preparation that significantly reduces the number of micro-organisms on intact skin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section I.E., comment 10, the agency is proposing the indication ``for the preparation of the skin
prior to an injection'' for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug products. The agency is further proposing that
products labeled for such use demonstrate effectiveness by testing according to the same procedure used to demonstrate
the effectiveness of patient preoperative skin preparation drug products not labeled for this use. Based on this
intended use of alcohol drug products, the agency is proposing a 1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in the microbial flora per square centimeter of a dry skin test site within 30 seconds of product use as the
effectiveness criteria for these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For surgical hand scrub products, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora of each hand from the baseline count within 1 minute, (2) suppression of bacterial
growth on each hand below baseline for 6 hours on the first day, (3) a 2-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the second day, and (4) a 3-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the fifth day, when tested by
a modification of the standard procedure for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub products published by the ASTM
(Ref. 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on glove juice test data for surgical hand scrub use of povidone-iodine (section I.I., comment 17), alcohol
(section I.E., comment 10), chloroxylenol (section I.G., comment 12), and triclosan (section I.L., comment 23),
the agency concludes that formulated products containing certain ingredients, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, chloroxylenol and triclosan, are substantive in their action and do not produce a high (1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) initial reduction, but after repeated use for up to 5 days do reduce the baseline count and suppress the count in the
user's glove. In a separate final rule, the agency stated that any product indicated for use as a surgical scrub should
meet a standard for initial reduction. A one-log reduction was found acceptable as the minimal level of reduction
suitable for a surgical scrub in a handwashing test. (See ``New Drugs Containing Hexachlorophene,'' published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 20, 1977; 42 FR 63771.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In that same final rule, the agency acknowledged that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hexachlorophene containing surgical scrub drug products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantive in their action and do not produce an initial high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction but with repeated use are effective in reducing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident skin flora and suppressing bacterial growth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
user's glove for up to 6 hours. Based on a lack of available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products capable of producing both an initial high reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident skin flora and a prolonged microbial suppression 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketed at the time of the agency's action on the ingredient in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1972, the agency agreed with the recommendations of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel and concluded that the ingredient should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be marketed for use as a surgical scrub and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwashing as part of patient care. The agency stated its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intention to reconsider its criteria for evaluating such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in light of risk-benefit judgments as new products containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both attributes become available (42 FR 63771). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since that final rule was issued in 1977, data have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the agency demonstrating the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub formulations capable of producing an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction and a suppression of microbial growth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearer's glove for up to 6 hours. (See section I.E., comment 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on alcohol and section I.I., comment 17 on povidone-iodine.) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency notes that the persistence of the antimicrobial effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by an alcohol-containing surgical hand scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation was provided by a preservative agent in the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the new data, the agency has concerns about the risk associated with the initial use of substantive surgical
hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub formulations, and with the use of these formulations after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended lapses in their routine use. Therefore, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that all surgical hand scrub formulations must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate an initial one-log reduction in the bacterial flora. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites comment on the use of substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised effectiveness criterion for these drug products, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing a revised definition of a surgical hand scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug product in &sect;333.403(c)(3) as follows: ``An antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms on intact skin; it is broad spectrum, fast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acting, and persistent.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the modified ASTM procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing of health-care or antiseptic handwashes, surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrubs, and patient preoperative skin preps being proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for inclusion in the testing requirements provide protocols that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate for the final formulation testing of these drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The proposed protocols describe, in detail, study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions and materials to be used and address the concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised by the comments. For instance, the proposed protocol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing of surgical hand scrub products includes a baseline

 bacteria per hand and specifies that a 50 to 100 mL volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sampling is to be used. The proposed protocols also specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for a number of areas not addressed by the testing guidelines proposed in the previous tentative final
monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, they address statistical aspects of study design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data analysis, and the use of neutralizers. A positive control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is included in the protocols as a means of validating the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure, equipment, and facilities. The agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed protocols for the testing of these products provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a consistent approach to the effectiveness testing of health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwashes, surgical hand scrubs, and patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations. The agency is incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above criteria and testing requirements in proposed &sect;333.470 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this tentative final monograph and invites specific comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them at this time. After reviewing any submitted comments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, the agency may revise the testing requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures prior to establishing a final monograph. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recognizes that the test procedures may need to be revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodically to reflect new information and newer techniques that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are developed and proven adequate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully reviewed the claimed active ingredients submitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this administrative record (Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183), which includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following: the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (39 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33103) and previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, the advance notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking for OTC topical alcohol drug products (47 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22324), and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical mercury-containing drug products (47 FR 436). Based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the available information, including clinical and marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history, as well as the recommendations of the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel, the agency is proposing a tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification for OTC health-care antiseptic active ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the ingredients included in the tabulation below are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Category II and Category III because of no data or a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on use as a health-care antiseptic. However, all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients have been included as a convenience to the reader. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency specifically invites comment and additional data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for topical antimicrobial OTC human use (47 FR 22324, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 21, 1982) is being incorporated into this amended tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph. In that proposed monograph, the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel recommended that alcohol 60 to 95 percent by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms regulations at 27 CFR part 21 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol 50 to 91.3 percent by volume in an aqueous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution be classified as Category I for topical antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. The following indications were proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrapes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splinter or other foreign object.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon submitted data and the conclusions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miscellaneous External Panel, the agency is including alcohol as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Category I surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash (see section I.E., comment 10). While no comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted data on health-care uses of isopropyl alcohol, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency notes that one comment (Ref. 1) from a manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that the OTC alcohol drug products monograph provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the labeling indication, ``antibacterial handwash.'' The same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer provided a submission (Ref. 2) to the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel on a combination product containing isopropyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol 50 percent and oxyquinoline sulfate 0.125 percent for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a germicidal-fungicidal wash. However, the Panel disbanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before it was able to review the submission, which contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling for a currently marketed product and in vitro studies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product's bacteriocidal activity. No in vivo effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data were submitted for the use of isopropyl alcohol as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, or surgical hand scrub. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the lack of data for the use of isopropyl alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub, the agency is placing the ingredient in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III for these uses. The agency invites data on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses of isopropyl alcohol. As discussed in section I.E., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10, the agency is including the Panel's recommended indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional Category I indication for patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations containing alcohol. Based on the Panel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations, the agency is also proposing isopropyl alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a Category I patient preoperative skin preparation for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication. However, based on the lack of data on the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol for more general patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation use, the agency is not proposing isopropyl alcohol as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category I for the other patient preoperative skin preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indications included in &sect;333.460(b)(1), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the skin prior to surgery'' and ``helps to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria that potentially can cause skin infection.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has evaluated standard textbooks and published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on the effectiveness of isopropyl alcohol used topically on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area prior to an injection (Refs. 3, 4, and 5). The minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective concentration of isopropyl alcohol for this use is 70 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. Further, the agency is not aware of any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the use of isopropyl alcohol below 70 percent for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol 70 to 91.3 percent in Category I for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation for the limited indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Miscellaneous External Panel recommended that drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing alcohol and isopropyl alcohol bear the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following warning: ``Flammable, keep away from fire or flame,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 22324 at 22330). The agency concurs with the Panel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended warning and is proposing this warning in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.450(c)(4) of this tentative final monograph. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the warning's prominence, the agency is further proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it appear in boldface type and as the first warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately following the heading ``WARNINGS''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is aware of ten reports (Refs. 6 and 7) of first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and second degree burns occurring in patients undergoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrocautery procedures. The burns were caused by the ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the isopropyl alcohol in patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations containing chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. The reports indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these incidents have occurred despite the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed warnings in the products' labeling cautioning that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are flammable until dry and should not be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool on body surfaces or should not be used in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrocautery procedures until dry (Refs. 8 and 9). Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reports, the agency tentatively concludes that patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of 70 percent or more cannot be adequately labeled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow the safe use of these drug products in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrocautery procedures. Therefore, the agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol in concentrations of 70 percent or more bear the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following label warning: ``Do not use with electrocautery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures.'' The agency is further proposing that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning immediately follow the flammable warning being proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;333.450(c)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not currently aware of any similar incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring with other nonemollient patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations containing alcohol in similar concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing that patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.412(a) bear a warning concerning the use of these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in conjunction with electrocautery procedures. However, the agency will consider extending the warning to patient

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol if new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information indicates that this is necessary. The agency invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific comment and data on the safety of both alcohol and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol containing patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations in conjunction with electrocautery procedures.

The Panel also stated that benzyl alcohol and chlorobutanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were safe, but recommended that the ingredients be categorized as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category II for effectiveness. However, in the first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic segment of this rulemaking these alcohol ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were reclassified from Category II to Category III for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness as first aid antiseptic ingredients. (See 56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33644 at 33673.) Because no comments, data, or information were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, and because the agency is not aware of any health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic uses for these ingredients, benzyl alcohol and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorobutanol are not being classified in this rulemaking for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency published an advance notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking for mercury-containing drug products on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436). That notice, based upon the recommendations
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel, proposed to classify OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercury-containing drug products for topical antimicrobial use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not generally recognized as safe and effective and as being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranded. The agency received no comments. The Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified the mercurial ingredients, as a group, in Category II; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some for lack of safety, some for lack of efficacy, and others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to a lack of both safety and efficacy. However, in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several mercury-containing OTC topical antimicrobials have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reclassified from Category II to Category III for effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mercurial ingredients placed in Category II for safety were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reclassified. The ingredients reclassified are calomel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merbromin, mercufenol chloride, and phenylmercuric nitrate. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change was made in keeping with the revised effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for the drug product category ``first aid antiseptic,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which were not available at the time the Miscellaneous External 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel evaluated the effectiveness of mercurial ingredients. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56 FR 33644 at 33672.) The agency is unaware of any clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data or marketing history for the use of mercury-containing drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products as health-care antiseptics. Consequently, these drugs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been classified as health-care antiseptics. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the agency has reviewed submitted data on two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combinations containing mercurial ingredients and proposes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category II classification for these combinations. (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I.M., comments 24 and 25.)

In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency concluded that cloflucarban and triclocarban are not generally
recognized as safe and effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care
personnel handwash. The Panel reviewed safety and effectiveness data on these ingredients formulated as a bar soap
and classified them in Category III as a health-care personnel handwash when formulated as a bar soap (39 FR 33103 at
33124 and 33126). No safety and effectiveness data for the use of clofucarban in the other health-care antiseptic
drug product classes were submitted to the OTC drug review; no data were reviewed by the Panel; and no data were received
by the agency. Cloflucarban is therefore considered to be outside this monograph except as a health-care personnel
handwash (formulated as a bar soap). Accordingly, cloflucarban remains Category II as a health-care antiseptic
for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation and surgical scrub and Category III as an antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional safety data and information were submitted to the agency on triclocarban formulated as a soap. As discussed
in the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33664), the agency has reviewed a chronic
toxicity study and other information and determined that triclocarban can be recognized as safe for OTC daily topical
use in a concentration of 1.5 percent. However, no effectiveness data were submitted for any health-care antiseptic
uses of this ingredient and the agency is classifying triclocarban in Category III as an antiseptic handwash or health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. In the previous tentative
final monograph, the agency placed the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban in Category III (43 FR 1210 at
1230) to be ``used in antimicrobial soap *&blank;*&blank;*''. No additional data were submitted on this combination.
Therefore, the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban remains in Category III for antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the Panel's recommendations on phenol, in the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified
phenol less than 1.5 percent as Category III and phenol greater than 1.5 percent as Category II for use as a health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub (43 FR 1227 and 1229). Hexylresorcinol
was also classified in Category III for these uses in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1229). No additional
data were submitted on health-care antiseptic uses of phenol and hexylresorcinol and their classifications are
unchanged in this amended tentative final monograph. In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified
triple dye (a combination of gentian violet, brilliant green, and proflavine hemisulfate) in Category II as a health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub based on a lack of safety data
(43 FR 1239). No additional data have been submitted and the ingredient remains in Category II for health-care antiseptic
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comment 85 of the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1223), the agency deferred classification of several
ingredients to the Miscellaneous External Panel. All of the ingredients have been classified with the exception
of methyl alcohol and gentian violet 1 and 2 percent solutions. The Miscellaneous External Panel at its 38th meeting
placed methyl alcohol in Category II as an OTC topical antimicrobial ingredient for both safety and effectiveness
(Ref. 1). However, this classification was not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol
drug products. The agency agrees with this classification. Further, the agency is not aware of any use of methyl alcohol
in OTC drug products, except as a denaturant. Gentian violet was reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Oral Cavity
Drug Products and placed in Category III based on the lack of effectiveness data for use as a topical antimicrobial
on the mucous membranes of the mouth. The agency is not aware of any data on the use of gentian violet as a health-care
antiseptic and places this ingredient in Category III for this use.

Fluorosalan was not classified as an OTC topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial ingredient in the previous tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph because the agency stated that final regulatory action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been taken against ``*&blank;*&blank;* the halogenated salicylanilides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly *&blank;*&blank;* fluorosalan (21 CFR 310.508) *&blank;*&blank;*'' (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1210 at 1227). Although no comments were received, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that fluorosalan was not addressed in the final rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
halogenated salicylanilides (21 CFR 310.508), published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 of October 30, 1975 (40 FR 5027). In reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Antimicrobial I Panel's recommendations, the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the Panel did not intend to include fluorosalan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the group of halogenated salicylanilides which it recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be handled more expeditiously by the agency in a separate

 notice. (See the notice of proposed rulemaking for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain halogenated salicylanilides as active or inactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients in drug and cosmetic products (September 13, 1974, 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial drug products (September 13, 1974, 39 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33121) that fluorosalan be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as Category II for use in antiseptic handwash, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products.

2. Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Required testing procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the complete formulation of a health-care antiseptic
drug product are included in proposed &sect;333.470. These effectiveness testing procedures can also be used to
demonstrate the effectiveness of active ingredients not in a final formulation. Suggested safety testing is described
in the previous tentative final monograph. (See 43 FR 1210 at 1240 to 1242.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submission of data and information to demonstrate the
safety or effectiveness of any health-care antiseptic ingredient or condition included in the review by following
the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarified April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes procedures
for the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings with industry or other interested persons,
and agency communications on submitted test data and other information.

In addition, a number of format changes have been made that are consistent with the format used in recently published
tentative final and final monographs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
2. The agency is proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general statement of identity for the product categories
of patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care personnel handwash drug products.
The agency is also providing manufacturers the option to provide alternative statements of identity describing
only the specific intended use of the product, e.g., surgical hand scrub. When the term ``antiseptic'' is used as the
only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use product, the intended use(s) is to be included as part
of the indications. For multiple use products the agency proposes that a statement of the intended use(s) should also
precede the specific directions for each use. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The agency is proposing that the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' may also be used for a health-care
personnel handwash. The agency is proposing to expand the indications proposed for health-care personnel handwash
drug products in the previous tentative final monograph to read, ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially
can cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of
the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under
medical care or treatment.'') The agency is also proposing ``recommended for repeated use'' as another allowable
indication for this product class. (See section I.B., comment 5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agency has replaced the previously proposed definition of an antimicrobial (active) ingredient with a definition
of an ``antiseptic'' drug that is consistent with the definition of an antiseptic in section 201(o) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)). The agency is also including a definition for a health-care antiseptic
as follows: ``An antiseptic containing drug product applied topically to the skin to help prevent infection or to
help prevent cross contamination.'' The agency has also proposed revised definitions for patient preoperative
skin preparations and surgical hand scrubs that reflect the agency's proposed effectiveness criteria for these
products. (See section I.N., comment 28.) In addition, the agency has made minor revisions in the definitions of a
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub to reflect the
revised terminology being used in this amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The agency is adding to this amended tentative final monograph a definition of broad spectrum activity as follows:
A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro
activity against the micro-organisms listed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory
concentration determinations conducted according to methodology established in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). The
agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included in this
tentative final monograph. (See section I.C, comment 6.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
6. The agency has reviewed the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in &sect;333.85 for health-care personnel handwash, in &sect;333.87
for patient preoperative skin preparation, and in &sect;333.97 for surgical hand scrub and determined that statements
such as ``contains antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial ingredient(s),'' and ``non-irritating,''
are not related in a significant way to the safe and effective use of these products and are not necessary on products
intended primarily for health-care professionals. Therefore, the agency is not including these statements in this
amended tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. The statement ``recommended for repeated use,'' proposed for a health-care personnel handwash, has
been included as an ``other allowable indication'' in proposed &sect;333.455. The terms ``broad spectrum'' and
``fast acting'' are included in the definitions of all three product classes and the agency does not see the need to
include this information in the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling. (See section I.D., comment 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The agency is proposing revised indications for patient preoperative skin preparations in order to more precisely
describe the intended uses of these products. The previous indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``antibacterial,''
and ``antimicrobial'' are not being included. Likewise, the indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``bacteriostatic,''
and ``bactericidal'' previously proposed for surgical hand scrubs are not being included in this amended tentative
final monograph. The agency believes that these terms are product attributes and not indications for use and should
not be included as indications in the labeling of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Based on the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking
for OTC alcohol drug products (47 FR 22324 at 22332), the agency is proposing ``for preparation of the skin prior to
an injection'' as an indication for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The agency is proposing in &sect;333.450(c) of this amended tentative final monograph the following general warning
statements for all health-care antiseptic drug products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``For external use only.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``Do not use in the eyes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``Discontinue use if irritation and redness develops. If condition persists for more than 72 hours consult a doctor.''
The agency is further proposing that the second sentence of the proposed warning in (3) above may be deleted for products
labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' (See section I.D., comment 8.) In addition to the general warnings
proposed for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency is proposing the following warning for patient preoperative skin
preparations containing isopropyl alcohol identified in &sect;333.412(d): ``Do not use this product with electrocautery
procedures.'' The proposed warning is based on reports of burns associated with the use of isopropyl alcohol containing
patient preoperative skin preparations with electrocautery procedures. (See section II.A., paragraph 1_Summary
of Ingredient Categories.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Based on its review of the published literature (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), the agency has determined that the way in which
health-care antiseptic drug products are used, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 method of application, duration of scrub or wash, or use in conjunction with a device (such as a scrub brush), contributes
to the effectiveness of these drug products. Therefore, instead of proposing directions for use of these products
that include fixed scrub or wash durations or methods of application, the agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;333.455(c),
333.460(d), and 333.465(c) directions for use that reflect the conditions used when the antiseptic product was tested
according to &sect;333.470(b). In addition, based on data indicating that the largest bioburden of the hands lies
in the subungual region (Ref. 4), the agency is proposing that the directions for use of surgical hand scrub drug products
include the following instructions for the trimming and cleansing of the nails: ``Clean under nails with a nail pick.
Nails should be maintained with a 1 millimeter free edge.''

11. The agency is aware that some manufacturers provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical information relating to the antimicrobial activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their health-care antiseptic drug products in the form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical information bulletins. The agency considers such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulletins to be labeling under the provisions of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201(m) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``labeling'' as ``all labels and other written, printed, or graphic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter (1) upon any article or any of the containers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.'' As labeling, technical information bulletins are subject to the OTC
drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has no objection to the inclusion of technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information relating to the antimicrobial activity of these OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products in the labeling of products intended for health-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care professionals only. Therefore, in this amended tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph the agency is proposing that manufacturers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the option of including data derived from the in vitro and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinical effectiveness tests included in &sect;333.470 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed monograph as additional labeling for products labeled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and marketed ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such additional information provide a standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison of the effectiveness of these OTC drug products, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is further proposing that only data on the antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity of these OTC drug products derived from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness tests included in &sect;333.470 of this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph be included in the labeling of these OTC drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the present time, claims of product effectiveness against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms other than those included in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an NDA containing information supporting the deviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the monograph in accord with &sect;330.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Based on the wound healing data from studies of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds in laboratory animals that were discussed in the first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(comment 37, 56 FR 33644 at 33662), the agency has reevaluated the labeling for iodine tincture as a patient preoperative
skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation and is not including the warning ``Do not apply this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product with a tight bandage, as a burn may result.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The agency has determined that data and reports have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics has brought about overgrowth of gram-negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria, particularly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed caution in &sect;333.99(a) concerning this overgrowth is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.D, comment 9.) The warnings proposed in &sect;333.99 (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (c) of the previous tentative final monograph are not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this amendment because these warnings apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds which currently are not Category I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health-care antiseptic uses. (See section I.J., comment 20.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The agency is not including the warning proposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel in &sect;333.98(c)(2) for products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing isopropyl alcohol, ``Use only in a well-ventilated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area; fumes may be toxic.'' As discussed in section II.B., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph 32 of the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33556), the agency invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for such a warning, including any reports of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions due to inhalation that have not yet been brought to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in a number of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor'' for ``physician'' in OTC drug
monographs on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis that the word ``doctor'' is more commonly used and better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understood by consumers. Based on comments to these proposals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency has determined that final monographs and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable OTC drug regulations will give manufacturers the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of using the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph proposes that option in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.450(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Based on the withdrawal of the majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on chlorhexidine gluconate as a health-care antiseptic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient data upon which to make a safety and effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination are no longer present in the rulemaking. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.F., comment 11.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The agency has reviewed the data submitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloroxylenol and is classifying chloroxylenol 0.24 percent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.75 percent as Category I for safety and Category III for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness for short-term use (patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation) and Category III for both safety and effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for long-term uses (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash and surgical hand scrub). (See section I.G., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. In &sect;333.30(a) of the previous tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph, the agency included United States Pharmacopeia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(U.S.P.) specifications for iodine tincture and topical solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying these Category I patient preoperative products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine tincture U.S.P. and iodine topical solution U.S.P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. The agency has reviewed the submitted data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hexachlorophene and concludes that the data do not address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hexachlorophene remain available by prescription only. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.H., comment 13.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The agency has evaluated a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sorbitan monolaurate and found it to be safe for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub and health-care personnel handwash, but there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are insufficient data available to determine its effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these uses. Therefore, it is being classified in Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. (See section I.I., comment 15.) The other iodine-surfactant complexes classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in Category III for health-care uses due to a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The agency is including povidone-iodine 5 to 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent as a Category I health-care antiseptic ingredient for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.I., comment 17.) As discussed in section I.I., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16, the agency is not including the warning about the interaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iodophors and starch-containing compounds proposed in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph (43
FR 1221). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is also not including professional labeling to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weight of povidone-iodine or special warnings related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. (See section I.I., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 18.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The agency has evaluated the data submitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzalkonium chloride and determined that the data are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to establish the efficacy of this ingredient as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation. (See section I.J., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 20.) No data were received on other health-care uses of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this ingredient or health-care uses of the two other quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds (benzethonium chloride and methylbenzethonium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride) classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds remain in Category III as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. The agency has reviewed data submitted on sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxychlorosene, an ingredient not previously classified for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antiseptic use, and is placing this ingredient in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III for both safety and effectiveness. (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I.K., comment 22.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. The agency has reclassified triclosan up to 1 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Category II to Category III as a health-care antiseptic for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub. While submitted data indicate that triclosan_when properly formulated_may be effective, data that meet
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria described in section I.N., comment 28 are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish effectiveness. In addition, based upon submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety data and other information, the agency has reclassified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ingredient from Category III to Category I for safety for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triclosan remains classified in Category III for long-term use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub). (See section I.L., comment 23.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. The agency is proposing a number of Category I health-care antiseptic ingredients in this document. All of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients included in this proposal as Category I health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic ingredients are standardized and characterized for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality and purity and are included as articles in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary (U.S.P./N.F.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1). However, a number of other ingredients being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in this rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 triclosan and triclocarban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not listed in the U.S.P./N.F. For an active ingredient to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in an OTC drug final monograph, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information demonstrating safety and effectiveness, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to have publicly available sufficient chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that can be used by all manufacturers to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the ingredient is appropriate for use in their products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it would be appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties interested in upgrading nonmonograph ingredients to monograph status to develop with the United States
Pharmacopeial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Convention appropriate standards for the quality and purity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptic ingredients that are not already included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in official compendia. However, should interested parties fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide necessary information so that appropriate standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be established, ingredients otherwise eligible for monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status will not be included in the final monograph.

26. The agency is proposing testing requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in &sect;333.470 of this tentative final monograph. As part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the effectiveness criteria for a patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, the agency is proposing new testing requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products labeled with the proposed indication ``for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. The agency acknowledges that deodorancy is considered a cosmetic claim. However, some deodorant soap products
also bear antimicrobial claims. The agency stated in comment 10 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid
antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 at 33648) that deodorant soap products making antimicrobial claims are considered
to be drugs and that the testing guidelines for antimicrobial claims would be addressed in this rulemaking. Any deodorant
soap product containing a monograph ingredient may be labeled with antimicrobial claims provided the product meets
the testing requirements for health-care antiseptic drug products or surgical hand scrubs as described under proposed
&sect;333.470. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated in the previous tentative final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products (43 FR 1210 at
1244) that actual claims of deodorancy should correlate the microbial reduction achieved in a modified Cade handwashing
test to an ``adequately designed and executed deodorancy test, such as controlled sniff test.'' Several comments
to that proposal objected to such a correlation of deodorancy and microbial reduction. However, none of the comments
provided satisfactory data to enable the agency to include any test in a monograph as a standard for deodorancy due
to antimicrobial activity. Specific testing for antimicrobial claims for deodorancy has not yet been developed.
The agency intends to review any comments or methods submitted for such a purpose in response to this publication and
invites comments and data on this topic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The Panel's evaluation of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products did not include an evaluation of the use of these
products by the food industry as hand sanitizers or dips. Historically, hand sanitizers and dips have been marketed
as hand cleansers for use by food handlers in federally inspected meat and poultry processing plants and in food handling
establishments. Regulation of these products has been under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
However, it has come to the agency's attention that many of these products include label claims that the agency considers
drug claims, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``antibacterial handwash,'' ``kills germs and bacteria on contact,'' or ``effectively reduces bacterial flora
of the skin''. (See comment 10 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644
at 33648).) Examination of the labeling of these products (Ref. 1) has led the agency to conclude that the intended
use of these products, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the reduction of micro-organisms on human skin for the purpose of the prevention of disease caused by contaminated
food, makes them drugs under the provisions of the act. Section 201(g)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)) defines
a ``drug'' as an article ``intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease
in man *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety and effectiveness of active ingredients in these products for drug use needs to be demonstrated. Therefore,
the agency is including evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobial active ingredients
indicated for use as hand sanitizers or dips in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products. Accordingly,
the agency invites the submission of data, published or unpublished, and any other information pertinent to the use
of topical antimicrobial ingredients in hand sanitizers or dips. The agency also invites comment on applicable effectiveness
standards for these products. These data and information will facilitate the agency's review and aid in its determination
as to whether these OTC drug products for human use are safe, effective, and not misbranded under their recommended
conditions of use. This evaluation will provide all interested parties an opportunity to present for consideration
the best data and information available to support the stated claims for these products. The agency suggests that
all submissions be in the format described in 21 CFR 330.10(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be eligible for review under the OTC drug review procedures, the ingredient must have been marketed in a
hand sanitizer or dip to a material extent and for a material time (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(2)). The submission of data should
include information that demonstrates that the ingredient(s) has been marketed as a hand sanitizer or dip to a material
extent and for a material time. Products with ingredients under consideration in the OTC drug review may be marketed
(at the same dosage strength and in the same dosage form) under the manufacturer's good faith belief that the product
is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded and in accord with FDA's enforcement policies related
to the OTC drug review. (See FDA's Compliance Policy Guides 7132b.15 and 7132b.16.) Such products are marketed at
the risk that the agency may adopt a position requiring relabeling, recall, or other regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that antimicrobial hand sanitizers/dips marketed for use in food handling/processing are typically
labeled for a variety of other antimicrobial uses that may include various animal ``drug'' uses and the disinfection
of inanimate objects. These other uses of hand sanitizer or dips will not be included in the agency's evaluation as
part of this rulemaking.

29. The agency is proposing to remove a portion of &sect;369.21 applicable to OTC health-care antiseptic drug products
when the final monograph eventually becomes effective because a portion of the regulations will be superseded by
the final monograph. The item proposed for removal is the entry for ``ALCOHOL RUBBING COMPOUND'' in &sect;369.21.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Analysis of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of this proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. This proposed rule increases the number of ingredients tentatively classified
as generally recognized as safe and effective for use in OTC health-care antiseptic drug products from the previous
proposal and, if finalized as proposed, would reduce the need for further safety and effectiveness testing for a number
of health-care antiseptic drug products. The detailed testing procedures included in the proposed rule should assist
manufacturers of products containing ingredients not included in the proposed monograph, due to a lack of demonstrated
effectiveness, in performing the tests that would demonstrate effectiveness so the ingredients can be included
in the final rule. The testing procedures will also provide manufacturers guidance on testing requirements for regulatory
compliance. Products that contain ingredients for which safety and effectiveness are not established will require
reformulation. The proposed monograph includes ingredients that may be used if reformulation becomes necessary.
All products will need some relabeling. One year will be provided from the date of publication of the final rule for
any necessary relabeling or reformulation. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, no further analysis is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs
associated with product testing, relabeling, repackaging, or reformulation. Comments regarding the impact of
this rulemaking on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation.
Because the agency has not previously invited specific comment on the economic impact of the OTC drug review on health-care
antiseptic drug products, a period of 180 days from the date of publication of this proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be provided for comments on this subject to be developed and submitted. The agency will evaluate any comments
and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the
final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before December 14, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch, written comments,
objections, or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oral
hearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination
may be submitted on or before December 14, 1994. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requests are to be submitted,
except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief.
Comments, objections, and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons, on or before June 19, 1995, may also submit in writing new data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness
of those conditions not classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submitted on or before August
17, 1995. These dates are consistent with the time periods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural
regulations for reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copies of all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that
individuals may submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document. Data and comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch. Received
data and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closing of
the administrative record on August 17, 1995. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative record will
be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, unless the Commissioner finds good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is proposing to amend 21 CFR part 333 by adding new subpart E, consisting of &sect;&sect;333.401

(iii) Determine the possible development of resistance to the chemical. Two approaches to determining the emergence
of resistance to a particular antimicrobial are to be used. The first approach involves a determination of the evolution
of a point mutation by the sequential passage of an organism through increasing concentrations of the antimicrobial
included in the culture medium. The second approach is a thorough survey of the published literature to determine
whether resistance has been reported for the antimicrobial ingredient. The survey is to include information on the
microbial contamination of marketed products containing the antimicrobial ingredient in question irrespective
of drug concentration. The survey is to cover all countries in which products containing the active ingredient are
marketed. Any information submitted in a foreign language should include a translation. Alternate approaches to
determining the development of resistance can be submitted as a petition in accord with &sect;10.30 of this chapter.
The petition is to contain sufficient data to show that the alternate approach provides a reliable indication of the
development of resistance to a particular antimicrobial ingredient.

(A) The assessment of the in vitro spectrum of the antimicrobial provides information on the types of genera and species
that may be considered susceptible under the conditions of the test procedure described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)
of this section. However, information is also required that allows an assessment of how rapidly the antimicrobial
product produces its effect. Such information may be derived from in vitro time-kill curve studies using a selected
battery of organisms and a specified drug concentration.

(B) The satisfactory performance of the test product as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed by the results of the MIC studies, the time-kill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies, and the simulated in vivo clinical trials of organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing the resident microbial flora can then be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the effectiveness of the test product for the transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial flora most commonly encountered in the clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting. This procedure is required because methods, other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the health-care personnel hand test, do not exist for assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the in vivo effectiveness of test products versus the transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial flora. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) It is recognized that a generally accepted or

submission of proposed methods that may be considered applicable

to this test. Many variables that should be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of a method have been addressed for antibiotics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also applicable to these products. Such variables are

Because the time frames of greatest interest for antiseptic drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products intended for health-care personnel handwash, surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrub, and patient preoperative skin preparation use are 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 30 minutes, the time-kill studies are to focus on these time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frames and are to include enumerations at times 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15, 20, and 30 minutes. Enumerate the bacteria in the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution by a standard plate count procedure such as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in ``Standard Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the

conditions of the test product and the transient microbial flora 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most likely to be encountered by health-care professionals in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinical settings. Therefore, the micro-organisms to be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these time-kill studies are to be the standard ATCC strains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The drug

) A definitive recommendation regarding the inclusion

of an inactivator prior to the final wash cannot be made. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions of whether residual neutralizer on the skin will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effectiveness of the test formulation in subsequent washes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and result in higher than expected bacterial counts and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or not samples can be processed rapidly enough to avoid a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreased bacterial count due to the continued action of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation should be considered when the decision concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a neutralizer in sampling solutions used for bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection prior to the final wash is made. Whatever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, to facilitate the comparison of results across studies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the investigator is to indicate whether or not a neutralizer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been included.

D is the clinical difference of significance to be ruled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out; say 20 percent of the active control's mean reduction from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline at a specific time. For example, data from a number of glove juice studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted over the past few years to the agency as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications under part 314 of this chapter were reviewed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain information relative to the variance of the difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from baseline for count reduction data. For 128 standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviations extracted, it was noted that 50 percent of the values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are between .90 and 1.12; 25 percent are less than .90; and 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent are greater than 1.12. The range is from .49 to 1.73, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 25th percentile standard deviation is 0.86, the median 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard deviation is 1.01, and the 75th percentile standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation is 1.20. The larger the standard deviation, the larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample size required to rule out a difference of clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance. Assuming that the active control surgical hand scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces a mean log reduction of 2.5 at hour 3 and the test hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub is to be within 20 percent of this,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
= 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.02, then n=64 subjects per arm of the study. Because blocks of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample size of 90 subjects per arm. The total number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluable subjects required for a successful trial will depend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the estimate of variance available and the number of

A randomized, blinded, parallel arm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design is to be used to test the products. Due to the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their constituents, some test surgical hand scrubs will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not only the use of an active control arm but also use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle control arm and perhaps a placebo control arm to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate efficacy. The schematic layout of sampling

Assume N evaluable subjects are enrolled (the issue of determining N, the sample size, is discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F)

Count determinations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No sooner than 12 hours, nor longer than 4 days after completion of their baseline determination, subjects perform
the initial scrub with the test formulations. Determine the bacterial population on the randomly designated hand
of all subjects assigned to hour 1/60 in Table 2 of paragraph (b)(iii)(G) of this section immediately (within 1 minute)
after scrub with the appropriate scrub formulation. Determine the bacterial counts on the designated hands at 3 and
6 hours after scrub. Determine bacterial population by sampling hands and enumerating the bacteria in the sampling
solution as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(K) and (b)(1)(iii)(L) of this section. Repeat this scrubbing and
sampling procedure the next day (day 2). On day 5, repeat the sampling procedure after scrubbing with the formulations
two additional times on day 2 and three times per day on day 3 and day 4, with at least a 1-hour interval between scrubs.
Perform one scrub on day 5, prior to sampling. In summary, the subjects scrub a total of 11 times with each formulation,
once on days 1 and 5 and 3 times per day on days 2, 3, and 4. Collect bacterial samples following the single scrubs of days
1 and 5 and following the first scrub on day 2. This procedure mimics typical usage and permits determination of both
immediate and longer-term reductions.

Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy Products'' (available from American Public Health Association, Inc., 1015 15th
St. NW., Washington, DC 20005) but using soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the antimicrobial
where necessary. The suitability of the inactivator is to be demonstrated using a procedure such as described in E
1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, and
Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance

) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities, it is required that the test formulation
be compared with an active control formulation. This will require an equivalent number of panelists to be assigned
to the control formulation on a random basis. All test parameters will be equivalent for both formulations, except
that the scrub procedure for the established formulation may be different from that of the test formulation. Both
test and control formulations are to be run concurrently. Identity of the formulations used by panelists are to be
blinded from those individuals counting plates and analyzing data.

Statistical analyses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Either of the statistical approaches to the evaluation of the data detailed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(O) of this section
is acceptable.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Treat data as a binomial response. That is, if a subject achieves the target reduction, it is judged a success; if not,
it is a failure. A potential problem to this approach is that information may be lost. For example, if at the 1 minute
time frame, a large number of subjects using one skin scrub achieve a 2-log reduction and those on the other scrub attain
only a 1-log reduction, the binomial procedure will indicate both scrubs achieve the same degree of reduction. If
it is believed that the binomial approach causes loss of information by not including numerical response data, then
the alternate statistical analysis described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(0)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section is applicable. If the success rate is in the 90 percent range, then the variance is relatively small,
sample size requirements are relatively small, and confidence intervals are reasonable. However, if the success
rates drop to the 70 percent range, then relatively large sample sizes are required to obtain the same power as one gets
for 90 percent success rates.

Wash and rinse procedure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wash and rinse procedure described as follows is for all washes with the test formulation. A specified volume of
the test formulation is dispensed onto the hands and rubbed over all surfaces, taking caution not to lose or dilute
the substance. After the material is spread, a small amount of water is added from the tap and the hands are completely
lathered for a specified time period. The lower third of the forearm is also washed. After completion of the wash, hands
and forearms are rinsed under tap water at 40

&cir;C for 30 seconds. A total of 10 washes with the test formulation is involved. Bacterial samples are taken following
the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th washes.

Bacterial sampling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th washes, place rubber gloves or polyethylene bags used for sampling on the right and
left hand. Sampling should occur within 5 minutes after each of these washes. Add 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling
solution to each glove and secure gloves above the wrist. After adding sampling solution, uniformly massage all surfaces
of the hand for 1 minute, paying particular attention to the area under the nails. After massaging aseptically, sample
the fluid of the glove. Transfer immediately a measured volume of the sampling fluid to a test tube containing a suitable
antimicrobial inactivator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Because contamination, product use, and enumeration are conducted sequentially within a time period of less than
a day, an inactivator included in the sampling solution prior to the final wash may affect the test results. Therefore,
no inactivator for the antimicrobial in the handwash formulation is to be included in the sampling solution prior
to the final wash. The 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling fluid may be sufficient to dilute out the activity of the antimicrobial;
however, this should be demonstrated using a procedure such as the one described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluation
Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectants, Sanitizer, and Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual
Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR

) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities, it is required that the test formulation
be compared with an active control formulation. This will require an equivalent number of panelists to be assigned
to the control formulation on a random basis. All test parameters will be equivalent for both formulations, although
the handwash procedure for the established formulation may be different from that of the test formulation. Both test
and control formulations are to be run concurrently. The identity of the formulations used by panelists is to be blinded
from those individuals counting plates and analyzing data.

reductions are less variable and evaluation of the log counts using the Student's t- test or similar procedure is recommended.

Study design and randomization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Subjects admitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the study are to be identified as to whether they meet the groin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion or abdomen portion of the study, or both. Once a subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is admitted to the study, treatments are to be randomly assigned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to one contralateral groin site, for subjects identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belonging to this study group and similar treatments are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
randomly assigned to left or right side of the abdominal area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for subjects identified as belonging to the abdominal study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. This method of choosing subjects and sampling sites fits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the paired comparison statistical design. Randomization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects to time periods and treatment to left or right side is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be accomplished in accordance with the plan similar to that

 (

1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Two ways to statistically evaluate effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a preoperative scrub product are presented. The first depends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon calculating the average log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction from baseline. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is accomplished by obtaining the difference in log counts for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each paired sample for each subject in the appropriate sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frame. This will facilitate subsequent statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of resulting data. It is usually fairly easy to enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects with counts 1&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or greater when working with the groin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. It is anticipated this method will primarily be used to evaluate data collected from the groin areas. The sample
size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimation equation given earlier may be used to estimate sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes required for this case. Standard deviations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative scrub products are relatively homogeneous when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion criterion require counts of 1&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or greater. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard deviations extracted from files range from 0.82 to 1.72; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the median standard deviation was 0.98. When counts in the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were used, the standard deviation ranged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.78 to 1.22, with a median value of 0.99. Using the sample size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimation equation given in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section and assuming the active control preoperative scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces an immediate mean log reduction of 2.0 and test scrub is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be within 20 percent of this, i.e., D=0.4, and S
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
=0.98, gives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n=97 subjects per arm of the study. Because blocks of 6 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended, the sample size per treatment arm is 96 subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The second method for evaluating the data depends upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing an entry target bacterial population of greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250 colony forming units per square centimeter and a target 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction criterion that a successful scrub reduces bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counts to below 25 colony forming units per square centimeter. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful scrub product is to provide this degree of reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in at least 90 percent of the subjects tested. Using the normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binomial confidence interval approach, it can be shown that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard preoperative scrub product achieves a 90 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success rate and it is desired to rule out success rates less than 85 percent for the new product with power of 80 percent
then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
340 subjects per arm are required. If it is desired to rule out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success rates less than 80 percent, then the sample size is only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 per arm. Again, since blocks of 6 or some multiple thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are recommended, the sample size is 102 subjects per study arm.

enumeration are obtained by the detergent scrub cup technique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hold a sterile scrubbing cup firmly to the skin. Aseptically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pipet 2.5 milliliters of sterile sampling solution into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrubbing cup and rub the skin with a sterile rubber policeman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1 minute using moderate pressure. Aspirate the wash fluid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and place in a sterile test tube. Place a second 2.5-milliliter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aliquot of sampling solution in the scrub cup and rub the skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
again for 1 minute with the rubber policeman. Pool the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washes and enumerate the bacteria.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal governments and Exxon under
which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal
Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore
to their pre-spill condition the natural resources and the services they provide, that were injured by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resource injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided
by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services.
Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources,
and acquisition of equivalent resources and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All decisions about restoration and uses of restoration funds are determined by six natural resources Trustees,
three Federal and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and of the Interior.
The three State Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game and Environmental Conservation, and the Attorney
General. A Trustee Council, located in Alaska, which is made up of the three State Trustees and designees of the three
Federal Trustees, is responsible for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, uses of the restoration funds,
and all restoration activities including the preparation of a Restoration Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473&hyph;12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Forest Service published
a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS on the Restoration Plan. This was later revised on January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2352&hyph;2353).
Since then the Trustee Council developed a draft Restoration Plan which has become the proposed action for the analysis
conducted in the DEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Draft Restoration Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed action (Draft Restoration Plan) consists of nine policy statements, a discussion of categories of restoration
actions and broad objectives for injured resources. The policies for identifying and conducting restoration actions
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The restoration program will take an ecosystem approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Restoration activities may be considered for any injured resource or service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Most restoration activities will occur within the spill area. However, restoration activities outside the spill
are, but within Alaska, may be considered when the most effective restoration actions for an injured migratory population
are in a part of its range outside the spill area or when the information acquired from research and monitoring activities
outside the spill area will be important for restoration or understanding injuries within the spill area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Restoration activities will emphasize resources and services that have not recovered. Resources and services
will be enhanced, as appropriate, to promote restoration. Restoration projects should not adversely affect the
ecosystem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Projects designed to restore or enhance an injured service must have a sufficient relationship to an injured resource;
must benefit the same user group that was injured; and, should be compatible with the character and public uses of the
area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
6. Competitive proposals for restoration projects will be encouraged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Restoration projects will be subject to independent scientific review before Trustee Council approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Meaningful public participation in restoration decisions will be actively solicited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Government agencies will be funded only for restoration work that they do not normally conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four types of restoration actions are identified and discussed in the Draft Restoration Plan: General restoration,
habitat protection and acquisition, monitoring and research, and public information and administration. Alternatives
to the proposed action place different emphases on each of these categories of restoration actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Restoration consists of activities that fall within manipulation of the environment, management of human
use for reduction of marine pollution. Decisions about conducting general restoration projects would look at the
following factors: Extent of natural recovery, the value of an injured resource to the ecosystem and to the public,
the duration of benefits, the technical feasibility of the project, the likelihood of success, the relationship
of costs to expected benefits, potential for harmful side effects, benefits to more than one resource, effects on
health and human safety, consistency with applicable laws, and policies, and duplication with other actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat Protection and Acquisition is a category that includes purchase of private land or interests in land such
as conservation easements, mineral rights, or timber rights. It also includes recommendations for changing public
agency management practices. Specific policies that relate to habitat protection and acquisition are proposed.
These policies deal with ranking potential lands to determine potential benefits, the need for a willing seller,
purchasing at fair market value, post acquisition management of the acquired lands and involving the public in the
prioritization process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring and Research consists of recovery monitoring, restoration monitoring and ecological monitoring and
research. Specific policies governing the selecting and performance of monitoring activities are discussed in
the Draft Restoration Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Information and Administration is the last category of restoration actions. It consists of all necessary
administrative actions that are not attributable to a particular project. The Draft Restoration Plan goal for this
category is for administrative costs to average no more than 5% of overall restoration expenditures for the remainder
of the settlement period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General restoration objectives have been developed for resources that are recovering, resources not recovering,
resources where the recovery is unknown, resources such as archaeological resources and wilderness, and services.
These broad objectives will guide in the development of annual work plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further information regarding the proposed action and possible restoration alternatives is included in the Draft
Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, April 1993; the Supplement
to Draft Exxon Valdez Oil spill Restoration Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, June 1993; the Summary
of Public Comment on Alternatives of the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, September 1993; and the Draft
Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, November 1993. Copies of these documents may be requested from the Oil Spill

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at this time. To be most helpful, comments
on the DEIS statement should be as specific as possible, and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits
of the alternatives discussed. (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of DEIS statements must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position
and concerns. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC. 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that
could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final EIS. Wisconsin
Heritage, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive
comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and
respond to them in the final.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that silicomanganese from Brazil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 2, 1993 (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this case (see USITC Publication 2714, December, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We issued the antidumping questionnaire on January 18, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Companhia Paulista de Ferro-Ligas and Sibra-Eletroside&racute;urgica 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brasileira S/A (collectively, ``Paulista''). On January 24, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives of the Department of Commerce (the Department) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met with Paulista officials in Brazil to provide further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanation of the antidumping questionnaire and to answer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding technical and procedural questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses to the questionnaire were received on February 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, and March 7, 1994. Petitioners in this investigation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elkem Metals Company and the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local 3&hyph;639, submitted comments regarding deficiencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paulista's questionnaire responses on March 17 and 18, 1994. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental questionnaire was issued on March 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paulista submitted responses to this questionnaire in April and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 2 and 8, 1994, Paulista asked the Department to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend the product matching criteria included in Appendix V of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questionnaire. Petitioners submitted comments on Paulista's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request on February 7 and 9, 1994. On February 10, 1994, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Appendix V with respect to the silicon content and sieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size categories (see letter from Gary Taverman to Dorsey &amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whitney, dated February 10, 1994, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main building of the Department of Commerce). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of petitioners, on March 30, 1994, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department postponed its preliminary determination until no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than June 10, 1994 (59 FR 16177, April 6, 1994).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 13, 1994, based on petitioners' March 14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegation of sales below cost of production (COP), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department initiated a COP investigation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision memorandum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford, dated May 13, 1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and issued a COP questionnaire. However, because of the deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for Paulista's COP questionnaire response, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information could not be considered for the preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. It will be considered for the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination.

Postponement of Final Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 26, 1994, Paulista requested that, in the event of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department postpone its final determination to 135 days after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), if our preliminary determination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affirmative, and the Department receives a request from producers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or resellers who account for a significant portion of the exports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under investigation, we will, absent compelling reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial, grant the request. Because Paulista represents a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant portion of the exports under investigation and there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no compelling reasons to deny the request, we are postponing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final determination until the 135th day after the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this investigation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous. All compositions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Some silicomanganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may also be classifiable under HTS subheading 7202.99.5040. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding is dispositive.

Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation (POI) is June 1, 1993, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that the class or kind of merchandise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to this investigation constitutes two such or similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories: silicomanganese lumps and silicomanganese fines. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making our fair value comparisons, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix V to the antidumping duty questionnaire. In accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 19 CFR 353.58, the Department normally attempts to compare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level of trade, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where possible. Because Paulista did not make sales at the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of trade in Brazil and the United States, we made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparisons without regard to level of trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether Paulista's sales of silicomanganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Brazil to the United States were made at less than fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.

In accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Paulista on purchase price because all sales were made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated purchase price sales based on prices to

unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, handling and foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inland freight in order to adjust these prices to an ex-factory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. We did not add an amount for interest revenue because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paulista failed to place adequate information on the record to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support this adjustment (see concurrence memorandum, dated June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology for calculating an addition to USP under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should be the result of applying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the

Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Federal-Mogul decision, we have added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to USP the product of the home market tax rate and the price of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce that the home market tax was applied to foreign market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales. We have also deducted from the USP and the FMV those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the home market tax and the USP tax adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to expenses included in the home market and United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States bases of the tax if those expenses are later deducted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the home market tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were levied upon foreign market sales.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still
reflect the inclusion of these expenses in the bases. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between adjusted USP and FMV, but is the result of differences between the expenses in the United States and the home
market that were deducted through adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This adjustment to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with court decisions. The United States Court
of Appeals has held that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not
create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP.

In this investigation, we added to USP an amount for value added tax that would have been paid had the U.S. sale not been
exported. In Brazil, there are four different taxes levied on sales of the subject merchandise in the home market which
are not levied on export sales: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Imposto sobre a Circulac&atilde;o de Mercadorias e Servicos (ICMS), a regional tax with a rate that varies depending
upon the state in which the purchase originates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI), the Federal value-added tax which is levied at a rate of four percent;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Programa de Integrac&atilde;o Social (PIS), a social integration program tax which is levied at a rate of 0.65
percent; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Contribuicao do Fim Social (CONFINS), a social investment fund tax which is levied at a rate of 2.0 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since the total volume of merchandise
sold by Paulista in Brazil during the POI was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales
for each such or similar category, we determined that the home market was viable. Therefore, we based FMV on home market
sales for both silicomanganese lumps and silicomanganese fines, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a). We excluded
from our analysis sales to a related customer that were not claimed by Paulista to be at arm's length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated FMV based on prices to unrelated customers. In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's
(CAFC) decision in

United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer deducts home market movement charges
from FMV pursuant to its inherent authority to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjust for those
expenses under the circumstance of sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision
of 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in the present case, we made circumstance of sale adjustments for certain post-sale home market movement
charges under 19 CFR 353.56. Also pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where
appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, warehousing, sampling-weighing-testing expenses, and bank
fees. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b), we added commissions paid on U.S. sales and deducted indirect selling expenses
incurred on sales in Brazil up to the amount of the U.S. commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under our past practice, if the Department determines that a country is hyperinflationary, we calculate FMVs on a
monthly basis to eliminate the distortive effects of inflation (see, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair
Value and Amended Antidumping Duty Order, Tubeless Steel Disc Wheels from Brazil, 53 FR 34566, September 7, 1988).
An economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary if its monthly inflation rate is greater than 5 percent or if its annual
inflation rate is greater than 60 percent. We determined that Brazil's economy was hyper-inflationary during the
POI. Brazil's inflation rate was over 60 percent during 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included in FMV the amount of the VAT collected in the home market (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the sum of the actual IPI, PIS and CONFINS tax rates plus the weighted-average ICMS rate). However, we calculated
the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the sum of any adjustments, expenses, and charges that were deducted from the tax base). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above. This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions
and deductions had been made.

Based on petitioner's allegations, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, the Department initiated an
investigation to determine whether Paulista made home market sales at prices below its COP over an extended period
of time, which would not permit the recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time. However, Paulista's COP questionnaire
response is due on June 16, 1994, which is after the deadline for the preliminary determination. The response will,
however, be considered for the final determination.

Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that silicomanganese from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely
to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Act). The estimated margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on December 2, 1993, (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events
have occurred: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified us of its preliminary determination
that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured, or threatened
with material injury, by reason of imports of silicomanganese from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair
value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 6, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent antidumping questionnaires to 18 producers
and exporters that may have sold silicomanganese to the United States during the period of investigation (POI). Company
names and addresses were either obtained from the petition or from the Census Bureau's IM&hyph;115 data. In the accompanying
cover letter, the Department requested that companies without U.S. sales during the POI advise the Department of
this fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, on January 6, 1994, the Department sent a copy of the antidumping questionnaire to the PRC's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). In our transmittal letter, the Department requested MOFTEC to 1) furnish
the questionnaire to any silicomanganese producers and exporters with U.S. sales during the POI that were not on our
list of 18 companies, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) provide a comprehensive list of those additional companies that received the questionnaire from MOFTEC. On April
12, 1994, the Department sent a second letter to MOFTEC again requesting a list of all companies that had received the
questionnaire from MOFTEC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MOFTEC did not respond to either letter, and most of the potential respondents neither replied to our questionnaire
nor notified us that they had not made any sales to the United States during the POI. The only two companies that did respond
to our questionnaire, Jinzhou Ferroalloy Works (Jinzhou), a PRC producer of silicomanganese, and Bogay Investment,
Ltd. (Bogay), a Hong Kong company that purchased silicomanganese from Jinzhou and exported it directly to the United
States, reported one sale made four months prior to the POI. Although, as noted above, the cover letter accompanying
the questionnaire stated that companies with no sales of the subject merchandise during the POI need only notify us
of this fact, Jinzhou and Bogay chose to respond to the questionnaire. Bogay submitted its questionnaire responses
on February 14 and February 28, 1994, and Jinzhou submitted its questionnaire responses on March 7 and March 23, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 2, 1994, the Department determined that this investigation was extraordinarily complicated. Therefore,
in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act, the Department postponed the preliminary determination until
June 10, 1994. (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 20, 1994, counsel for petitioners alleged the existence of critical circumstances. The Department has investigated
whether critical circumstances exist, and our preliminary results are listed below under ``Critical Circumstances.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department determined on May 23, 1994, not to expand the POI to include Jinzhou and Bogay in the investigation (see
Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford, dated May 23, 1994).

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called
ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing
much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally
contains by weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous.
All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of these investigations, including
silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of
both silicon and manganese. These investigations cover all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification.
Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 (HTS). Some silicomanganese may also be classifiable under HTS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTS subheading
is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive.

Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. Customs shipment data suggest that there were sales of subject merchandise during the POI. Because MOFTEC and
most of the potential respondents failed to provide information concerning whether there were such sales, the Department,
in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, must base its preliminary determination on best information available
(BIA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperate in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who do not cooperate in an investigation. Since the potential respondents in this case did not
cooperate, we assigned a BIA margin based on the most adverse assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, BIA is the information contained in the petition, as amended on November 24, 1993. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Ukraine and Venezuela, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993.) The amended petition provides only one margin, listed below, for all PRC producers
and exporters of silicomanganese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from the PRC. Pursuant
to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we analyzed the allegations using the Department's standard methodology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To find critical circumstances, the Department must determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the same class or kind of subject merchandise, or
the importer knew or should have known that the producer or reseller was selling the subject merchandise at less than
its foreign market value; and 2) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have not found a history of dumping of PRC silicomanganese in the United States or elsewhere. According to Department
practice, however, we will impute knowledge of dumping to importers of subject merchandise when the dumping margin
exceeds 25 percent in purchase price situations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see Preliminary Determination on Silicon Carbide from the PRC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 58 FR 64549, December 8, 1993). In this case, the estimated dumping margin for silicomanganese imports from the PRC
is 150.00 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We consider imports of merchandise under investigation to be massive if there has been an increase of 15 percent or
more over a relatively short period of time. For the preliminary determination, we were able to obtain import data
through the month of March. To determine whether there have been massive imports of silicomanganese from the PRC,
we compared the import volume for the month in which the petition was filed, November, and the four months subsequent
to that month with the import volume for the five months prior to the filing of the petition, using Department of Commerce
shipment data. We found that the import volume of silicomanganese during the period subsequent to the filing of the
petition was massive, increasing by 426.83 percent over the previous period's import volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, the Department preliminarily finds that critical circumstances exist in this case.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that silicomanganese from Ukraine is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States
at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated
margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Case History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on December 2, 1993, (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events
have occurred:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified us of its preliminary determination
that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or threatened with
material injury, by reason of imports of silicomanganese from Ukraine that are alleged to be sold at less than fair
value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent to the Embassy of Ukraine the antidumping questionnaire.
(The antidumping questionnaire was divided into three sections. Section A requesting general information on each
company, section C requesting information on, and a listing of, U.S. sales made during the period of investigation
(POI), and section D requesting information on the production process, including specific amounts of each input
used in manufacturing silicomanganese.) We requested that the Embassy of Ukraine forward the questionnaire to all
Ukrainian exporters and producers of silicomanganese and ensure that complete questionnaire responses were submitted
on their behalf.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the week of January 31, 1994, representatives of the Department met with officials in Ukraine to provide further
explanation regarding the antidumping questionnaire and to answer outstanding technical and procedural questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two Ukrainian producers/exporters, Nikopol Ferroalloys Plant (Nikopol) and Zaporozhye Ferroalloys Plant
(Zaporozhye) submitted responses to section A of the questionnaire on February 18, 1994, and section C of the questionnaire
on March 14, 1994. Responses to section D of the questionnaire were submitted by Zaporozhye and Nikopol on March 31,
1994, and April 8, 1994, respectively. Petitioners submitted deficiency comments on April 22, 1994. The Department
requested clarifications regarding the responses from both respondents on May 6, 1994, and additionally from Nikopol
on May 13, 1994. Both respondents submitted these clarifications on May 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 2, 1994, the Department determined that this investigation was extraordinarily complicated due to the dramatic
changes occurring in the Ukrainian economy and, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)(II) of the Tariff Act
of 1930, extended the preliminary determination until June 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 15, 1994, the Department requested comments concerning appropriate surrogate countries for Ukraine from
all interested parties. Only petitioners submitted comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this investigation involves a non-market economy (NME), on May 4, 1994, the Department sent Nikopol and Zaporozhye
supplemental questionnaires to elicit information necessary to determine whether either company merits a separate
antidumping rate. To date, neither respondent has submitted a response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 20, 1994, petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese
from Ukraine. Pursuant to the Department's request, respondents submitted shipment data on June 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners provided surrogate value information on May 27, 1994, and on May 31, 1994, submitted comments to be considered
for the preliminary determination.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), Nikopol and Zaporozhye, which together account for all exports of the merchandise
covered in this proceeding, have requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination, the Department postpone
the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination. Because we
find no compelling reason to deny the request, we are postponing the date of the final determination until not later
than 135 days after the date of publication of this notice.

Surrogate Country
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In past antidumping investigations, the Department has considered Ukraine to be a NME country. Ukraine has not contested
this designation, and we are continuing to consider it a NME country. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(c)
of the Act, the Department has based foreign market value on factors of production, and has valued the factors of production
using surrogate values from market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that
of Ukraine, and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to dramatic and ongoing changes in Ukraine's economy, we were not able to identify a single preferred surrogate
country for Ukraine. Therefore, we have ranked groups of surrogates into three tiers: Egypt, Colombia, Morocco,
and Peru, which we determined were most similar to Ukraine in per capita GNP and population size, were assigned to tier
one; Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, and Indonesia were placed in tier two; and finally, the
Philippines and El Salvador were included in tier three. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Memorandum from Dave Mueller, Director, Office of Policy, to Gary Taverman, dated May 2, 1994 on file in Room B&hyph;099
of the Main Commerce Department building.) It should be noted that although the tiers are ranked hierarchically,
the surrogate countries are not hierarchically ranked within each tier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We considered surrogate values for the factors of production from first-tier countries as most desirable and surrogate
values from second-tier countries the next most desirable. Values from third-tier countries were used only as a last
resort when factor-price data were not available from countries in the first two tiers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances, we were able to obtain surrogate values for a particular factor of production from only one country.
Where surrogate values were available from more than one country within a tier, we averaged the pricing data for all
of the countries. We then used the average price for that tier to value the factor of production. For purposes of this
preliminary determination, we determined that this was the most objective method given that there was no basis for
distinguishing countries included within the same tier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When we were not able to value factors of production using published, publicly-available information from any surrogate
country, we relied on information provided by U.S. embassies and consulates in the surrogate countries.

Fair Value Comparisons
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of silicomanganese from Ukraine to the United States were made at less than fair value,
we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.

In accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP for Zaporozhye on purchase price because all sales were made
to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States. For Nikopol, we have based USP on exporter's sales
price (ESP), under section 772(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated purchase price for Zaporozhye based on prices to an unrelated purchaser in the United States. We made
deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and loading expense (which were both valued in a surrogate
country), to adjust the prices to an ex-factory basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated ESP for Nikopol based on prices at which the merchandise was sold on various terms to unrelated purchasers
in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and loading expense (which
were both valued in a surrogate country), marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. customs duty, U.S. customs brokerage
and U.S. inland freight, to adjust the prices to an ex-factory basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calculating U.S. price for Nikopol, we excluded one sale of silicomanganese fines because this sale was atypical
of Nikopol's U.S. sales and represented an insignificant amount of Nikopol's total U.S. sales during the POI.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by Zaporozhye and Nikopol. The factors used to produce silicomanganese
include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported factors of production were valued using prices
obtained in surrogate countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of material inputs, we also used surrogate transportation rates to value the transportation of inputs
from their sources to the silicomanganese factories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value manganese ore, we used an average of CIF import values from two first-tier surrogate countries: Colombia
and Egypt. The source of both values was United Nations Trade Statistics for 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We were unable to find published, publicly-available information for manganese sinter, and we received no relevant
information from the U.S. diplomatic posts. Therefore, for the preliminary determination, we have valued this product
using manganese ore prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value quartzite, we relied on a publicly-available Moroccan import value contained in United Nations statistics.
To value coke, the most current publicly-available source was a Colombian value for 1992 exports reported on an FOB
basis in statistics published by the United Nations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To value electricity, we used publicly-available information from Colombia contained in the Departamento Nacional
de Planeacion's Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos (June 1993). We selected this source because it provided
an electricity rate for industrial use during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value natural gas, we relied on an average of two published, publicly-available values for our first-tier surrogate
countries, Colombia and Morocco. The Colombian value was reported on a FOB Colombian port basis and was obtained from
U.S. import statistics for 1993. The Moroccan value was the average price at which natural gas was imported into that
country in 1992. The source of this value was the 1992 International Trade Statistics Yearbook, Volume 1, 1993. Before
averaging these values, we converted the Moroccan value into a price per cubic meter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value production labor, we used published, publicly-available values for Egypt from the 1993 Year Book of Labour
Statistics, 52nd edition. We used the most recent statistics available, values from 1987, which we inflated to the
POI using statistics published by The Economist Intelligence Unit: Egypt Country Profile 1993/94. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), and profit, we found no publicly-available, published
information. In addition, we were unable to use information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt for SG&amp;A and
profit because we were unable to determine the cost bases upon which the Egyptian percentages were calculated. Therefore,
we relied on the statutory minimums of ten percent for SG&amp;A and eight percent for profit (see section 773(e)(1)(B)
of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For factory overhead, we also found no publicly-available, published information. In addition, we were unable to
use the information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt for factory overhead because we were unable to determine
the cost basis upon which the overhead percentage was calculated. Furthermore, the statute does not provide any minimum
percentage for factory overhead. Therefore, we relied upon information from the second-tier surrogate country
of Bolivia provided by the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia. This information was used during the recent antidumping investigation
of Refined Antimony Trioxide (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Refined Antimony Trioxide
From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 6801, February 28, 1992.) The information is in a cable in the public file
for this case (

see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 La Paz Cable 14178, September 23, 1991). Except as noted below, where necessary, we adjusted the above surrogate country
prices for inflation to the POI using the wholesale price indices published for each of the surrogate countries by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the case of Peru, we used the consumer price index of the IMF because the IMF
does not publish a wholesale price index for that country. In the case of Egypt, for which the IMF publishes neither
wholesale nor consumer price indices, we adjusted for inflation, where necessary, using statistics published by
The Economist Intelligence Unit: Egypt Country Profile 1993/94.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the accuracy of all information used in making our final determination.

Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from Ukraine.
Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16 (1993), we requested shipment information from Zaporozhye
and Nikopol and attempted to analyze that information using the Department's standard methodology. To find critical
circumstances, we must determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the same class or kind of subject merchandise, or
the importer knew or should have known that the producer or reseller was selling the subject merchandise at less than
its foreign market value; and 2) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have not found a history of dumping of Ukrainian silicomanganese in the United States or elsewhere. According to
Department practice, however, we will impute knowledge of dumping to importers of subject merchandise when the dumping
margin exceeds 25 percent in purchase price situations. In this case, the estimated dumping margin for silicomanganese
imports from Ukraine is 123.02 percent, a rate which exceeds our benchmark for imputing knowledge of dumping. Therefore,
we have preliminarily found that importers should be imputed knowledge of dumping of the subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2), the Department considers imports of subject merchandise to be massive if there has
been an increase of 15 percent or more over a relatively short period of time. We also consider, when possible, the respondent's
share of import penetration of the domestic market in making this determination. In this case, evidence indicates
that Ukrainian U.S. market penetration has increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether imports increased, we have examined the volume of imports by comparing volumes for the five months
subsequent to the filing of the petition (November 1993 through March 1994) to the five months prior to the filing of
the petition (June 1993 through October 1993). Although Zaporozhye has provided adequate information to perform
an analysis of whether imports have increased, Nikopol has not done so. Specifically, the shipment information provided
by Nikopol was inconsistent with its sales data. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the concurrence memorandum, dated June 10, 1994.) Given that neither company has established its eligibility for
separate dumping margins, the data concerning critical circumstances must be considered in a consolidated manner.
Accordingly, given the lack of adequate information, we preliminarily determined that there have been massive imports
of silicomanganese from the Ukraine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the Department preliminarily finds that critical circumstances exist in this case.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of silicomanganese from Ukraine that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
90 days prior to the date of publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
exceeds the USP as shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further
notice.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that silicomanganese from Venezuela is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States
at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (the Act). The estimated margins
are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 2, 1993 (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events have occurred: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination
in this case (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 USITC Publication 2714, December, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 14, 1994, we issued the antidumping questionnaire to Hornos Electricos de Venezuela, S.A. (Hevensa),
which accounted for at least sixty percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. On January
20, 1994, representatives of the Department of Commerce (the Department) met with Hevensa officials in Venezuela
to provide further explanation of the antidumping questionnaire and to answer outstanding technical and procedural
questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses to the questionnaire were received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 14, 1994, and March 1, 1994. On March 10, 1994, petitioners in this investigation, Elkem Metals Company and
the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers, Local 3&hyph;639, submitted comments regarding deficiencies in Hevensa's
questionnaire responses. A supplemental questionnaire was issued to Hevensa on March 25, 1994. Hevensa submitted
responses to this questionnaire on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 19, 1994, and May 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 15, 1994, petitioner submitted an allegation that Hevensa had sales below the cost of production (COP) in
the home market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of petitioners, on March 30, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until no
later than June 10, 1994 (59 FR 16177, April 6, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 9, 1994, based on petitioner's March 15, 1994 allegation, the Department initiated an investigation of sales
below COP in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision memorandum from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford, dated May 9, 1994). We issued a COP questionnaire
on May 9, 1994. However, because Hevensa's COP response is not due until June 22, 1994, this information could not be
considered for the preliminary determination. It will be considered for the final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners and Hevensa submitted comments regarding certain issues throughout May and June, 1994.

Postponement of Final Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 27, 1994, Hevensa requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone its final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary
determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling
reasons for denial exist, we are postponing the final determination until the 135th day after the date of publication
of this notice in the

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called
ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing
much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally
contains by weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous.
All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including
silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of
both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification.
Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also be classifiable under HTS subheading 7202.99.5040.
Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope
of this proceeding is dispositive.

Such or Similar Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that the class or kind of merchandise subject to this investigation constitutes two such or similar
categories: silicomanganese lumps and silicomanganese fines. In making our fair value comparisons, in accordance
with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales
of identical merchandise in the home market (third country market with respect to silicomagnese fines) to compare
to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping
questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19
CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible.

To determine whether Hevensa's sales of silicomanganese from Venezuela to the United States were made at less than
fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United
States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We based USP for Hevensa on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because all sales were
made to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated PP based on FOB Venezuelan port prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions,
where appropriate, for freight, loading expenses and rebates. We added an amount, where appropriate, for duty drawback,
in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP should be the result of applying
the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that
the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. Federal-Mogul, Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the CIT decision in Federal-Mogul, we have multiplied the foreign market tax rate by the price of
the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign
market sales, and have added the product to the USP. We have also deducted from the USP and the FMV those portions of the
respective home market tax and the USP tax adjustments attributable to expenses included in the foreign market and
United States bases of the tax if those expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the
foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the methodology for calculating the USP tax
adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign
market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still
reflect the inclusion of these expenses in the bases. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between adjusted USP and FMV, but is the result of differences between the expenses in the United States and the home
market that were deducted through adjustments.

The adjustment to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding
that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not create an antidumping
duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP.

In this investigation, Venezuela began collecting a value added tax (IVA) during the POI, on October 1, 1993. Consequently,
for those U.S. sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993, we added an amount for this tax, calculated as described above,
that would have been collected had the U.S. sale not been exported. For the U.S. sales invoiced prior to October 1, 1993,
we also added an amount for value-added tax when no home market comparison sales were made prior to October 1, 1993 (see
below).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since Hevensa's volume of home
market sales of silicomanganese lump was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales,
we determined that the home market was viable and, therefore, based FMV for silicomanganese lump on home market sales,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a). We found that the home market was not viable for silicomanganese fines. We selected
Peru as our third country market for sales of silicomanganese fines, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.49. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.46, we calculated FMV for silicomanganese lump based on delivered or FOB plant prices
to unrelated customers. In light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer deducts home market movement charges
from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjust for those expenses
under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR
353.56(b)(1) and (2), as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in the present case, we made circumstance of sale adjustments for post-sale home market movement charges
under 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight and loading charges. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2),
we also made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and royalties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the IVA was only levied on sales in the home market invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. Therefore,
we divided the reported home market sales into two categories, one covering home market sales invoiced during the
period June-September, 1993, and one covering sales invoiced on or after October, 1993. We accounted for the application
of the IVA tax only on sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the basis for FMV, we selected the home market group depending on when the U.S. sale was invoiced. For U.S. sales invoiced
prior to October 1, 1993, we used the former group, and for those sales invoiced after September 30, 1993, we used the
latter group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax
base (i.e., the sum of any amounts that were deducted from the tax base). See the ``United States Price'' section of
this notice, above. This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49, we calculated FMV for silicomanganese fines on FOB plant prices, inclusive of packing,
to unrelated customers in Peru. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where
appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and royalties. We deducted third country packing and added U.S.
packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.

 Chapter 19 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic
judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from a NAFTA
country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established
to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms
with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.

A first Request for Panel Review was filed with the Canadian Section of the NAFTA Secretariat, pursuant to Article
1904 of the Agreement, on May 30, 1994, requesting panel review of the final injury determination described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 39(1)(c) of the Rules provides that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A Party or interested person may challenge the final determination in whole or in part by filing a Complaint in accordance
with Rule 39 within 30 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline for filing a Complaint
is June 29, 1994);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A Party, investigating authority or interested person that does not file a Complaint but that intends to appear
in support of any reviewable portion of the final determination may participate in the panel review by filing a Notice
of Appearance in accordance with Rule 40 within 45 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline
for filing a Notice of Appearance is July 14, 1994); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The panel review shall be limited to the allegations of error of fact or law, including the jurisdiction of the investigating
authority, that are set out in the Complaints filed in the panel review and the procedural and substantive defenses
raised in the panel review.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to establish a healthcare information system. The infrastructure will
include application platform, application software, storage, human/computer interaction, and communication
technologies. It will share medical information while maintaining confidentiality of patient data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through the CRADA, called the ``Forum on Healthcare Information Technology Architecture Standards'', NIST will
provide the mechanism for industry and users to resolve standards-related technical issues that currently inhibit
deployment of medical information technology products. Parties interested in participating in the CRADA should
be prepared to invest adequate resources in the collaboration and be firmly committed to the goal of rapid development
and deployment of new healthcare information technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program will be within the scope and confines of The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&hyph;502,
15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the authority to enter into cooperative
research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute personnel, equipment and facilities_but
no funds_to the cooperative research program. Members will be expected to make a contribution to the forum's efforts
in the form of materials, equipment, personnel, and/or funds. The program is expected to last three years. This is
not a grant program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a forum to
establish a healthcare information system infrastructure. Through the CRADA, NIST will provide a venue and process
for industry and users to resolve standards-related technical issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This project is based upon a shared, global vision of a large scale distributed healthcare information infrastructure
which will encompass application platform, application software, storage, human/computer interaction, and communication
technologies, integrated via object oriented middleware. The new infrastructure will share medical information
while maintaining the security and confidentiality of patient data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRADA will also provide links among the user requirement-driven Open Systems Environment Implementors Workshop
(OIW), the consensus-driven base standards community, and the market-driven technical community to reduce time-to-market
for complex technical products requiring simultaneous consensus in a variety of technical areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International market input from the workshops and the standards community are crucial to meeting government and
industry objectives for common solutions across the global marketplace. Coordination with accredited U.S. and
international standards groups is an important aspect of this partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants will be assured of the technical and economic feasibility of the resultant technical products. This
will accelerate acceptance of the specifications, promote rapid development of commercial products, and contribute
to earlier deployment of technology to meet user needs.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A revision of FIPS 153, PHIGS, is being proposed. This proposed revision will add features to the basic PHIGS functionality
defined in FIPS 153, which adopts voluntary industry standards, ANSI/ISO 9592.1&hyph;3:1989, and ANSI/ISO 9593&hyph;1:1990,
9593&hyph;3:1990, 9593&hyph;4:1991. The basic PHIGS functionality provides for control and data interchange
between an application program and its graphic support systems and for a set of functions and programming language
bindings for the definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphic
data. New features will be provided by the proposed adoption of voluntary industry specifications ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992
for PHIGS PLUS. PHIGS PLUS will augment the basic PHIGS functionality by providing facilities for specifying curved
lines, curved and facetted surfaces, lighting and shading, and color. In addition, the proposed revision will add
a requirement for the validation of PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d) of the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Name of Standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) (FIPS PUB 153&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Category of Standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Software Standard, Graphics.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Explanation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 153 and supersedes that document in its entirety. This revision provides
a substantial, upward-compatible enhancement of the basic PHIGS functionality known as Plus Lumiere and Surfaces,
PHIGS PLUS (ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992). PHIGS PLUS adds facilities for the specification of curved lines,
curved and facetted surfaces, lighting and shading, and adds a mechanism for color specification to allow non-indexed
color specification. Amendments to each part of the PHIGS specification detail revisions required by PHIGS PLUS.
Also, each language binding of PHIGS has been amended as a result of PHIGS PLUS. The specifications and amendments
that comprise the complete PHIGS standard as a result of this revision are detailed in the Specification section of
this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition this revision adds a requirement for validation of PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings.
However, validation is currently limited to basic PHIGS functionality, and therefore does not include the new functionality
of PHIGS PLUS added by this revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIPS 153&hyph;1 adopts the American National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System,
ANSI/ISO 9592.1&hyph;3:1989, and ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992, and 9593.1:1990, 9593.3:1990, 9593.4:1991,
as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). This standard specifies the control and data interchange between
an application program and its graphic support system. It provides a set of functions and programming language bindings
for the definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphical data.
In addition, these language bindings allow for the definition, display and modification of geometrically related
objects, graphical data, and the relationships between the graphical data. The purpose of the standard is to promote
portability of graphics application programs between different installations. The standard is for use by implementors
as the reference authority in developing graphics software systems; and by other computer professionals who need
to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_to allow very highly interactive graphics application programs using 2D or 3D hierarchically structured graphics
data to be easily transported between installations. This will reduce costs associated with the transfer of programs
among different computers and graphic devices, including replacement devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_to aid the understanding and use of dynamic hierarchical graphics methods by application programmers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_to aid manufacturers of graphics equipment by serving as a guideline for identifying useful combinations of graphics
capabilities in a device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_to encourage more effective utilization and management of graphics application programmers by ensuring that skills
acquired on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of graphics programmer retraining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_to aid graphics application programmers in understanding and using graphics methods by specifying well-defined
functions and names. This will avoid the confusion of incompatibility common with operating systems and programming
languages.

9. Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 PHIGS is one of the computer graphics standards (Appendix A discusses the family of computer graphics standards)
provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. These graphics standards should be used for all computer
graphics applications and programs that are either developed or acquired for government use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
9.1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&blank;The FIPS for PHIGS is intended for use in computer graphics applications that are either developed or acquired
for government use. It is specifically designed to meet the performance requirements of such demanding applications
as Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufacturing, command and control, molecular
modelling, simulation and process control. It emphasizes the support of applications needing a highly dynamic,
highly interactive operator interface and expecting rapid screen update of complex images to be performed by the
display system. The PHIGS Plus functionality is designed to support graphics applications requiring lighting and
shading, curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces, and non-indexed color specification.

The use of this standard is compulsory and binding when one or more of the following situations exist:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_The graphics application is very highly interactive, or contains hierarchically structured graphics data, or
requires rapid modification of 2D or 3D graphics data and the relationships among the data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_It is anticipated that the life of the graphics program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized graphics
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The graphics application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may
result frequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The graphics application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers
of different makes and models and different graphic devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The graphics program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The graphics program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The graphics program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal government (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->

Nonstandard features of implementations of PHIGS should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot
reasonably be implemented with the standard features alone. Although nonstandard features can be very useful, it
should be recognized that the use of these or any other nonstandard elements may make the interchange of graphics programs
and future conversion more difficult and costly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
10. Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 American National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System, ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3:1989 and
ANSI/ISO 9592.1a, 2a, 3a, 4:1992, define the scope of the specifications, the syntax and semantics of the PHIGS elements
and requirements for conforming implementations. All of these specifications apply to Federal Government implementations
of this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI/ISO 9592.103:1989 and ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992 define a language independent nucleus of a graphics
system for integration into a programming language. Thus, it is embedded in a language layer obeying the particular
conventions of the language. FIPS 153-1 is therefore divided into two parts. Part 1 represents the functional aspects
of PHIGS. Part 1 consists of the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Functional description (ANSI/ISO 9592.1:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.1a:1992, Amendment 1)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
The functional description of PHIGS provides a set of functions for the definition, display and modification of 2D
or 3D graphical data. It also provides for the definition, display and manipulation of geometrically related objects,
along with the modification of graphics data and the relationships between that graphical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Archive file format (ANSI/ISO 9592.2:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.2a:1992, Amendment 1)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
The archive file provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval of PHIGS structures and structure network
definitions. It allows structure definitions to be stored in an organized way on a graphical software system. And,
facilitates transfer of structure definitions between different graphical software systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Clear-text encoding (ANSI/ISO 9592.3:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.3a:1992, Amendment 1)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
The clear-text encoding provides a representation of the archive file syntax that is easy to type, edit and read. The
file is human-readable (allows editing), human friendly (easy and natural to read) and machine readable (parsable
by software).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Plus Lumiere and Surfaces, PHIGS PLUS (ANSI/ISO 9592.4:1992)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
The Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) Plus Lumiere and Surfaces (PHIGS PLUS) extends
the basic PHIGS functionality by adding facilities for the specification of curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces,
lighting and other effects such as depth modulation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 2 of FIPS 153-1 consists of the bindings of PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS functions to actual programming languages, defined
in ANSI/ISO 9593:1990. These bindings are developed in cooperation with the voluntary standards committees of the
various languages. The following bindings currently exist, and form part 2 of FIPS 153-1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_The FORTRAN Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.1:1990);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The ADA Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.3:1990);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The C Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.4:1991).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent language bindings, including those for PHIGS PLUS, will be added periodically as they become available.
As these bindings are approved by ANSI, each language binding will become part of this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
11. Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Implementation of this standard involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition of PHIGS
software system implementations, interpretations of PHIGS implementations, and validation of PHIGS implementations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
11.1&blank;Effective Date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This revised standard is effective six (6) months after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Requirements for the
use of basic PHIGS functionality (defined in ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3;1989 and ANSI/ISO 9593.1:1990, 9593.3:1990, 9593.4:1991)
are unchanged and continue in effect. Validation of PHIGS implementations is required after the effective date in
accordance with section 11.4.

 Conformance to FIPS for PHIGS is required whether PHIGS toolbox packages are developed internally, acquired as part
of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified
for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology for procurement of FIPS for PHIGS is contained
in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding FIPS for PHIGS specifications and requirements, and issues
official interpretations as needed. Procedures for interpretations are specified in FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3. All questions
about the interpretation of FIPS for PHIGS should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL),

11.4&blank;Validation of PHIGS Implementations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Implementations of FIPS for PHIGS using either FORTRAN or C bindings shall be validated in accordance with NIST Computer
Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS for PHIGS. Recommended procurement terminology for validation
of FIPS for PHIGS is contained in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation,
Prior Validation Testing and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option. The agency
is advised to refer to the NIST publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Validated Products List
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for information about the validation status of PHIGS products. This information may be used to specify validation
time frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate
is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the PHIGS implementation offered. The criteria for applicability
of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require
that the offered version/release of the PHIGS implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software
environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter
settings; e.g., the sema parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark. An agency with a single-license
procurement may review the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Validated Products List
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to determine the applicability of existing VSRs or Certificates to the agency's hardware/software environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings shall be validated using the NIST PHIGS Test Suite, a suite
of automated validation tests for PHIGS implementations. The NIST PHIGS Test Suite was first released in July 1990
to help users and vendors determine compliance with FIPS for PHIGS. The most recent version of the test suite will be
used for validating conformance of PHIGS implementations after the effective date of FIPS PUB 153&hyph;1. The results
of validation testing by the PHIGS Testing Service are published on a quarterly basis in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Validated Products List
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). See related documents section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each release of the test suite has provided additional language bindings and test cases to increase the test suite's
coverage of PHIGS functionality. Version 2.1 of the NIST PHIGS Test Suite, released in April 1994, provides testing
for PHIGS implementations using either the FORTRAN or C language binding. Version 2.1 does not include tests for the
functionality of PHIGS PLUS added by this revision of FIPS for PHIGS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PHIGS Test Suite license includes all of the tests described above, documentation, and automatic notifications
of approved changes to the PHIGS Test Suite for a six month period. A license for the most recent version of the PHIGS
Test Suite is a necessary requirement for an organization that desires to be tested by the NIST PHIGS Testing Service
after the effective date of FIPS 153&hyph;1.

12. Waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waivers shall be granted only when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis upon which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority
to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives
and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the

The Family of Graphics Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following computer graphics standards are now available to address the needs of government applications in creating,
modifying, manipulating, and exchanging computer-generated pictures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;FIPS PUB 120&hyph;1, the Graphical Kernel System (GKS), which adopts ANSI X3.124&hyph;1985;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;FIPS PUB 153&hyph;1, the Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS), which adopts ANSI/ISO
9592&hyph;1989;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;FIPS PUB 128&hyph;1, the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM), which adopts ANSI/ISO 8632&hyph;1992 and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;FIPS PUB 177, the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES), which adopts ASME/ANSI Y14.24M&hyph;1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Computer Graphics Interface (CGI) has recently become an International standard, and is expected
to be issued as a FIPs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These standards fall into two categories: Application Programmer's Interface (API) standards, and Interoperability
standards. The goal of API standards is to enhance the portability of graphics programs (and programmers) between
installations and environments. The goal of Interoperability standards is to enable graphics data to be exchanged
successfully between graphics systems and devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 1 is a very simple reference model of a computer graphics operating environment. The model emphasizes that
a graphics application program interacts with physical devices and human operators via a computer graphics environment.
Figure 1 also shows that the application may receive information from an external database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The output of the graphics program, as shown in Figure 1, is directed to a virtual graphics device (i.e., Virtual Device
Interface or VDI) rather than directly to a physical device. A Device Driver provides an interface, implemented in
either hardware or software, for translating virtual device commands to commands understood by a particular physical
device. By substituting one device driver for another, an application can run on a different physical device. This
device independent is a central concept of this graphics reference model.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Figure 1, the API standards reside in the box labelled the Device Independent Graphics Package. Interoperability
standards are related to the boxes in Figure labelled Metafile, Database and Virtual Device Interface. Figure 2 depicts
the various graphics standards associated with the general model shown in Figure 1. These are discussed below.

Application Programmer's Interface (API) Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards at the API promote program and programmer portability. A standard at this level specifies a set of operations
on a variety of graphics objects. An API standard provides for the portability of applications across a wide range
of computer hardware, operating systems, programming languages, and graphics devices. A program written to an API
standard at one facility in one environment should be easily transferable to another facility in a different environment.
Facility dependencies should be the major area requiring modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific functions supported by a particular API standard provide certain capabilities. The application programmer,
by identifying the capabilities needed, determines the API better suited for the application. As shown in Figure
2, there are currently two graphics API standards, GKS and PHIGS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GKS provides a functional description of a two-dimensional (2D) graphics interface. It provides the basic graphics
support required by a wide variety of applications requiring the production of computer-generated pictures. A procedural
language binding of a functional standard specifies the exact name for each operation, its parameter sequence, and
the data types for the parameters. FORTRAN, Pascal, Ada and C language bindings are parts of GKS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GKS is suitable for use in graphics programming applications that employ a broad spectrum of graphics, from simple
passive graphics output (where pictures are produced solely by output functions without interaction with an operator)
to interactive applications; and which control a whole range of graphics devices, including but not limited to vector
and raster devices, microfilm recorders, storage tube displays, refresh displays, and color displays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
'
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHIGS provides for the definition, display, modification, and manipulation of 2D and 3D graphical data. It provides
functionality to support storage of graphics and application data in a hierarchical form. Information may be inserted,
changed, and deleted from the hierarchical data storage with the functions provided by PHIGS. Language binding specifications
for PHIGS include FORTRAN, C and Ada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHIGS is specifically designed to meet the performance requirements of such demanding applications as Computer
Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufacturing, command and control, molecular modeling,
simulation and process control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capabilities in PHIGS but not in GKS include: the centralized hierarchical data storage: the dynamic and responsive
nature of interactions; the addition of a modeling capability; and support for color models other than Red-Green-Blue
(RGB).

Graphics Interoperability standards allow graphical data to be interchanged between graphics devices. As shown
in Figure 2, there are three graphics interoperability standards, CGM, (future) CGI, and IGES.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CGM is used for the storage and transfer of picture description information. It enables pictures to be recorded for
long term storage, and to be exchanged between graphics devices, system, and installations. As indicated in Figure
2, the storage mechanism for CGM is in the form of a neutral file formal called a metafile. The software which creates
the metafile is known as a CGM Generator. The software which reads and displays a CGM metafile is known as an Interpreter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CGM specifies a semantic interface that describes 2D graphical entities using primitives (like polyline, text,
and ellipse) and attributes (like color, line width, interior style, and fonts). CGM is compatible with the specification
of 2D elements in GKS. A data encoding specifies the exact sequence of bits used to represent each operation and its
parameters. CGM contains three types of data stream encodings (binary, character, and clear text) to provide the
implementor choices depending on the particular application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IGES provides a method for representing and storing geometric, topological, and nongeometric product definition
data that is independent of any one system. Where CGM transfers graphical pictures, IGES transfers a graphical database
which can be processed to represent a picture. Thus IGES represents more than just purely graphical data. As Figure
2 indicates, the storage mechanism for IGES is in the form of a neutral file format that must be translated by a Preprocessor
and Postprocessor for conversion between systems. IGES permits the compatible exchange of product definition data
used by various computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The future CGI standard is designed to specify the exchange of information at the Virtual Device Interface. It will
provide an interface between the device independent and device dependent parts of a graphics system. Since CGI contains
information at a virtual level, it can be used to create a CGM. A CGM can also be output on a CGI device in a straightforward
manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 22, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 F.R.
19164) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received from the current contractor for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicator in response to a request for sales data. The contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that it is near a labor surplus area that is home to most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its workers and that it is experiencing less demand than it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply. The contractor indicated that most of its workers are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sole support for their families. Consequently, the contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that addition of the applicator to the Procurement List 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have a severe adverse impact on the company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proportion of the contractor's sales which it would lose if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unable to sell this applicator to the Government is very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small. It was not the current contractor for another item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned in its comments at the time the item was added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procurement List. Consequently, the loss of sales would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute severe adverse impact on the company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the contractor admitted, it is not located in a labor surplus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area even though some of its workers live in one. The contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also did not state that workers would be discharged if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicator is added to the Procurement List. Because these workers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live near an area which is not considered a labor surplus area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they may well secure other employment if they are discharged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
People with severe disabilities, on the other hand, have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unemployment rates exceeding 65% nationally. Like the contractor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers, people with severe disabilities are often the sole support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for their families. Consequently, the Committee believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definite creation of jobs for people with severe disabilities by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of the applicator to the Procurement List outweighs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible loss of employment for people who can more easily find 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the commodity listed below is suitable for procurement by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the commodity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commodity to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodity proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the Procurement List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procurement List: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 25, April 22 and May 2, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published
notices (59 F.R. 14154, 19164 and 22596) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors,
the Committee has determined that the commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and service to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and service to the Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement
List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the Consumer Product Safety
Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval, through September 30, 1994,
of a collection of information consisting of a survey of persons who call the Commission's hotline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year, about 170,000 members of the public call the Commission's toll-free hotline to report unsafe products
or to obtain information on product recalls, general safety information, or referrals to other federal, state, or
local health, safety or consumer agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12862, which includes the requirement that agencies
``survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing
services.'' The Commission's hotline is a major point of contact between the Commission and the public, and is one
of the few activities of the Commission for which customer service can be objectively measured. Therefore, it is critical
for CPSC to determine how hotline callers are being served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission plans to conduct a Customer Satisfaction Survey by sampling approximately 600 hotline callers. This
survey will be conducted by telephone and will require about four minutes for each interview. The Commission will
use the results of this survey to implement E.O. 12862 and to determine both the current level of customer satisfaction
and the additional kind and quality of services desired by the public.

correct a number of typographical errors. The Baltimore District of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the
feasibility of construction of fish and wildlife restoration measures in the Anacostia River basin. The District
Engineer recommends the restoration of 80 acres of wetlands, 5 miles of streams and 33 acres of bottomland habitat.
The feasibility study of the potential restoration actions was conducted under authority of a U.S. House of Representatives
Committee on Public Works and Transportation resolution adopted September 8, 1988. The non-Federal sponsors for
the feasibility phase of the project are: Montgomery County, Prince George's County, the District of Columbia, the
State of Maryland, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, and the Metropolitan Washington Counsel
of Governments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Public Works and Transportation, authorized the Anacostia River
and Tributaries study in a re solution adopted on September 8, 1988. The resolution requested the Corps of Engineers
to determine if further improvements for flood control, navigation, erosion, sedimentation, water quality and
other related water resources needs are advisable on the Anacostia River and tributaries.

2. The Anacostia River basin is a 170-square mile sub-basin of the Potomac River. Headwaters of the Anacostia River
are in the piedmont and coastal plain areas of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland and it joins with
the Potomac River in the District of Columbia. The entire river system is freshwater; although, the tidal influence
extends for approximately 9 miles above the confluence with the Potomac River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Corps of Engineers involvement in the basin dates back more than 115 years and includes projects and programs
for navigation, flood control, debris removal and aquatic vegetation control. These Federal actions have served
their intended purposes well and have benefited the area in terms of improved navigation and reduced flood damages.
However, from 1902 through the 1960s, project construction eliminated approximately 2,600 acres of wetlands, 99,000
linear feet of aquatic habitat and 700 acres of bottomland hardwoods. These ecosystems performed numerous beneficial
ecological functions for the Anacostia basin and the associated Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. One of the primary
functions of these ecosystems is fish and wildlife habitat. Historically, the Anacostia River basin contained a
diverse assemblage of fish and wildlife species. However, populations of many species have sharply declined due
to the habitat loss and degradation in the Anacostia basin.

5. The Baltimore District has prepared a DEIS which describes the impacts of the proposed projects on environmental
and cultural resources in the study area and the overall public interest. The DEIS also apply guidelines issued by
the Environmental Protection Agency, under authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (P.L. 95&hyph;217).
An evaluation of the proposed actions on the waters of the United States was performed pursuant to the guidelines of
the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
The Section 404(b)(1) evaluations show that the proposed actions meet all guidelines under the Clean Water Act, and
an exemption under Section 404(r) of Public Law 92&hyph;500, as amended is therefore requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The public involvement included meetings and close coordination with interested private individuals and organizations,
as well as concerned Federal, state and local agencies. A public notice requesting comments on the proposed project
and DS IS being provided to appropriate agencies and the public through printed media and mailings. The Baltimore
District invites potentially affected Federal, state and local agencies, and other interested organizations and
parties to comment on the study recommendations. Agencies that are currently involved in the feasibility study and
EIS process include, but are not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Geological Service, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, National Park Service,

The objective of this program is to identify, motivate, and begin preparation of students for science-based careers.
The proposed program will offer a year-round science and mathematics enrichment program for 75 youths in grades 4
through 9. The participants in this program will be among those underrepresented in science-based careers (minorities
and females). This program will provide to participants assistance in acquiring basic communication, computation
and reasoning skills, as well as exposure to a variety of science-based careers through field trips and the use of role
models.

Benedict College is a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and falls within the meaning and intent of Executive
Orders 12320, 12677 and 12876 pertaining to Government assistance to HBCUs. The participation of HBCUs in federally
supported programs is relatively limited. In order to overcome some of these limitations, the Executive Orders directed
federal agencies to increase the participation of HBCUs in federally-funded programs and to strengthen their capabilities
to provide quality education. This award represents an effort to strengthen the HBCU community. The program proposed
in the application is considered meritorious, and the activities to be carried out under this award would not be eligible
for financial assistance under any recent, current, or planned solicitation. Based on documentation presented
and appropriate evaluation, it is determined to be in the best interest of DOE to award a grant to Benedict College.

This proposal was a solicited application. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) issued a Request for Proposal
(RFP), RFP3657&hyph;01 ``Next Generation Geothermal Power Plant (NGGPP)_Phase 1 Studies'' on June 2, 1993. The
purpose of the RFP was to conduct studies that would expedite development of the next generation of geothermal power
plants. This includes development, evaluation and comparison of power plant concepts and ranking of the suitability
of these concepts for various geothermal resources. After a competitive evaluation process, EPRI selected the Ben
Holt Company to perform the study. Negotiations with the Department of Energy (DOE) for additional funding resulted
in 3 additional power plant concepts to be added to the scope of work. Competition for this effort would not be appropriate
for this effort since EPRI has already gone through a competitive process and it would have a significant impact on
the continuance and completion of the study.

The objectives of this effort are to evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, environmental impacts and the economics
of geothermal power plant technologies. This study is envisioned to be vital to developers in determining which technology
to use to most efficiently utilize their geothermal resource.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technologies that will be covered through this study are the following: Commercial air-cooled binary plants; commercial
flash plants; advanced binary cycles, which includes the use of mixed and alternative working fluids, alternative
cooling systems, advanced turbines and supersaturated turbine expansion; the Kalina cycle, which uses an ammonia-water
mixture as the working fluid and regenerative pre-heating and partial vaporization; advanced flash concepts that
will incorporate the use of equipment advances and cycle modifications; the use of rotary separator turbines in lieu
of steam flash tanks; sub-atmospheric flash cycles; hot dry rock; steam flash/binary hybrid plants; and geothermal/natural
gas hybrid plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above listed technologies will be optimized and rated for various geothermal resources. The geothermal resources
that will be used in this evaluation provide a cross section of possible temperature and pressure ranges available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high. The Ben Holt Company has been involved in the
geothermal industry for over 30 years, and the individuals involved have the experience and education that are needed
and required for this study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff of the Ben Holt Company are qualified and positioned to provide this service. Part of the competitive process
accomplished by EPRI was to verify that the applicants personnel were qualified to preform this task. DOE has also
verified that the individuals involved in this study have the appropriate education and experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ben Holt Company's base of operations is an office in Pasadena, California, and is fully capable of meeting their
needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public benefit to be derived from the proposed study will be an evaluation that shows utilities, independent power
producers and developers how to optimize the geothermal resources that are available to them. This study will also
show the economics and the environmental benefits of using geothermal energy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation accomplished through the proposed cooperative agreement support the geothermal energy conversion
program's direction and objectives. EPRI has competitively chosen the Ben Holt Company to perform this evaluation.
Therefore, issuing a solicitation for a competitive bid to accomplish a study of the Next Generation Geothermal Power
Plant would be inappropriate and would have a significant adverse impact on the accomplishment and completion of
the desired report.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has evaluated, in accordance with &sect;600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations, the unsolicited proposal
entitled ``PV Implementation Program'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted for support without
further competition in accordance with &sect;600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE is actively pursuing a program towards solar energy conversion, with one major objective being the cost-effective
application of photovoltaics (PV) in utility applications. This SCE activity directly relates to the program objective
and could be a significant step toward the implementation of PV in utility applications. The proposal from SCE is a
unique opportunity to install PV in a utility application which is likely to be one of the closest to being cost effective
in the near term. In addition, SCE is active in the promotion of renewable energy sources and is an ideal utility candidate
to pursue the proposed PV application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed application involves using PV to meet peak load requirements on selected SCE electric distribution
circuits. The circuits of interest are old, underground 4 kV circuits which have reached the limit of their load-carrying
capability. The circuits serve residential areas which have seen recent growth in peak load requirements so that
the circuits will soon exceed their limit during the summer peak load period. Without PV, the main alternative is to
replace the circuits by excavating city streets and landscaping to install new underground, high-capacity cable.
Installing PV to meet the peak load requirements on these circuits results in the deferment of this significant cable
replacement expense. SCE estimated that replacement of about 200 miles of underground 4 kV circuits in their system
could be deferred by the use of grid-connected PV. This would require approximately 25 MW of PV to meet the peak loads
on these circuits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The successful implementation of this project would provide:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The installation of on-grid PV systems in high-value, distributed-generation locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Major sustained PV procurements over several years, resulting in a stimulus to suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. PV price reductions which are expected to occur from large, sequential installations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Consistent, professionally-designed PV installations which will serve as demonstrations for other utilities
and industries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A cleaner environment in the SCE service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed on-grid PV installations are well-suited to the SCE service area. Several candidate 4 kV circuits have
been identified for the displacement of peak loads by grid-connected PV, with a sufficiently large number of potential
additional circuits to allow the project to develop into a major PV demonstration if warranted. Preliminary surveys
conducted by SCE indicate that sufficient space will be available in the residential areas to allow PV installations.

SCE has significant previous experience in PV systems, and has the necessary facilities to perform design and monitoring
functions. SCE has been involved with PV since 1978, and has been one of the most active utilities in the field of renewable
energy. By assigning a Manager of PV Applications, SCE has increased its commitment to PV development and implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCE has proposed a two-phase program, including a project feasibility assessment and project implementation. The
feasibility assessment will identify all technical, regulatory, budget/schedule, and environmental issues related
to the program in combination with the installation and monitoring of several small, pilot PV systems. The results
of this initial project phase will be used by SCE and DOE to determine the merits of proceeding to the second phase. Phase
II will include PV system final design, installation, and performance monitoring, and will proceed only after completion
of Phase I and after approval from DOE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The team proposed by SCE has sufficient experience in the development and deployment of PV systems, and should be capable
of successfully implementing the proposed on-grid PV program. As noted above, SCE has appointed a Manager of PV Applications
to strengthen the emphasis on PV implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed multi-disciplinary team includes personnel with experience in project management, cost/schedule
development and control, project engineering, PV applications, system planning, environmental affairs, and customer
service. As a major electric utility which has successfully completed complex energy generation projects, SCE has
the expertise required to perform all functions associated with PV implementation and monitoring in the proposed
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a Project Review Committee (PRC) will be established during the initial project phase to assist in technical,
analysis, data collection, and information dissemination issues. The PRC will have members from SCE, DOE, UPVG,
and national laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal has been found to be meritorious as stated above in the evaluation. The SCE program represents a unique
approach to utility applications of PV which has potential for near-term cost effectiveness. SCE has the capabilities
and commitment to renewable energy sources which should provide a basis for successful PV implementation in the proposed
application. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program cost is estimated to be $5,000,000 total, with the DOE share being $2,500,000 and the SCE share being $2,500,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed activities continue a multi-year program at UPVG intended to result in the achievement of PV acceptance
and use by electric utilities. The program involves several different tasks, with an overall objective being the
installation of 50 MW of new utility PV generation capacity within 5 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current UPVG program includes ten overall tasks, each with multiple subtasks. The ten tasks include:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of these tasks is a required element of the overall program to develop a utility market for PV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Recruitment of additional utility members in UPVG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. PV information dissemination to utilities and other groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Refined market analysis and PV evaluation tools, such as a cost estimating guide and PV-SCREEN, for analysis of
grid-connected PV systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Initiation of PV utility applications via large- and small-scale demonstrations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From the previous project phase, UPVG has developed a working relationship with its member utilities and has the expertise
to recruit additional utility members. Most of the other tasks in this phase are also extensions of work previously
begun by UPVG, such as information dissemination and PV market analysis. The techniques required for successful
completion of the proposed tasks are available at UPVG and have already been demonstrated in the previous activities.
Thus, the probability of success is high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Quality of the Applicant's Personnel and Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed efforts by UPVG do not require unique facilities or equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The team proposed by UPVG has significant experience in the development and deployment of PV systems, and should be
capable of successfully implementing the proposed PV program. The team includes senior personnel from several different
organizations, including private consultants with experience in utility projects, the Electric Power Research
Institute, and several electric utilities. The UPVG Executive Director has significant experience in technology
transfer and the management of associations since, in addition to UPVG, he also provides management and staff support
to the Fuel Cell Commercialization Group, the National Hydrogen Association, and the Utility Biomass Energy Technology
Association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a UPVG Board of Directors was previously established to assist in management, financial, technical,
and other issues. The Board is composed of personnel from member utilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Appropriateness and Adequacy of the Proposed Budget
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate. A total
of $1,209,000 will be required for the program, with $1,000,000 provided by DOE for the period of February 15, 1994
to March 31, 1995. Cost sharing will be provided by UPVG in the amount of $209,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UPVG program represents a unique approach to achieving utility involvement with PV. The program has potential
to result in near-term utility applications of PV technology and is consistent with DOE objectives. The proposed
project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competition for the effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity and completion of the proposed
activity. The UPVG is the only organization whose sole purpose is the advancement and development of cost-effective
utility applications of PV. UPVG has established relationships with all the utility participants and has developed
an understanding of the technical and management issues required for successful and timely accomplishment of program
objectives. Therefore, recompetition would cause a time delay of numerous months in task completion and would require
a significant duplication of costs to enable a new awardee to perform the proposed tasks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of hydroelectric projects
within the Kennebec River Basin in the State of Maine. The hydropower projects are located north of the City of Augusta
along the Kennebec River. The projects are: Weston No. 2325, Ft. Halifax No. 2552, Automatic No. 2555, Union Gas No.
2556, Rick Rips No. 2557, Oakland No. 2559, Wyman No. 2329, Moosehead No. 2671, Moxie No. 2613, Edwards No. 2389 and
Sandy River No. 11433. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the projects
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then
be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 13, 1994, from 7:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. in the Cushnoc Auditorium,
Augusta Civic Center, Augusta, Maine. Issues of primary concern to to general public will be the focus of the meeting.
The second scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, July 14, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. at the Augusta Civic
Center Drive, in the Washington and York rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Augusta Civic Center can be reached from the Maine Turnpike by taking Exit 31-South onto Civic Center Drive; proceed
one-half mile to the Civic Center entrance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the meetings, Scoping Document 1 Revised (SD 1&hyph;R) will be mailed to the list of interested parties. SD
1&hyph;R identifies resources issues to be address in the EIS. Copies of SD 1&hyph;R will also be available at the scoping
meetings or can be obtained by writing: FERC-Kennebec Projects, c/o Doug Hjorth, Stone Webster, 245 Summer Street,

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the licensee's
post-licensing filing that proposes modifications to project facilities and operation. Staff's initial evaluation
of the proposed modifications was issued on May 31, 1994, in a draft environmental assessment (DEA). The transmittal
letter for the DEA stated our intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will

p. Scoping Process: In gathering background information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the environmental document for the issuance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify significant environmental issues related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and operation or the continued operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scope of the environmental analysis as well. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scoping process would have little potential for causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be given.

q. Request for Scoping Comments: Federal, state, and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested to forward to the Commission, any information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide information related to the following items: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information, data, maps or professional opinion that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may contribute to defining the geographical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporal scope of the analysis and identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant environmental issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identification of and information from any other EIS or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Existing information and any data that would aid in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing the past and present effects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project(s) and other developmental activities on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments. For example, fish stocking/management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histories in the subject river, historic water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop land and water resources within the basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identification of any federal, state or local resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans and future project proposals that encompass the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject river or basin. For example, proposals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construct or operate water treatment facilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreation areas, or implement fishery management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation that would support a conclusion that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore should be excluded from further study or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from further consideration of cumulative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts within the river basin. Documentation should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, but not be limited to: how the project(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interact with other projects within the river basin or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other developmental activities; results from studies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource management policies; and, reports from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal, state, and local agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments concerning the scope of the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Collection of Economic and Regulatory Support Data Under RCRA (ICR No. 1641.01). This ICR requests approval for a
new collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) is requesting approval for a generic clearance to collect economic and regulatory
impact data through surveys, interviews, or focus group meetings with industry or other parties in support of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) rulemaking actions. RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments, requires EPA to establish a national regulatory program to ensure that hazardous waste is managed in
a manner protective of human health and the environment. EPA is authorized under sections 2002 and 3007 of RCRA to collect
information from industry and other parties when necessary to carry out its regulatory responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected will be used to assess the costs and benefits of various potential regulatory and nonregulatory
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first collection to be administered under the generic clearance, the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR)
Expert Elicitations, is included in this ICR. Information will be collected through interviews (expert elicitations)
with hazardous and industrial solid waste experts to support development of alternative approaches for hazardous
waste identification. The Agency will conduct two sets of expert elicitations, one for each HWIR regulatory option:
Contaminated Soil and Sediment Media; and Contaminated Debris.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The public reporting burden for this generic collection is estimated to average 3 hours per response and the burden
for the HWIR Expert Elicitations collection ranges from 15 minutes to 1.5 hours per respondent. These estimates include
all aspects of the information collection including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data
sources, gathering the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This General Preamble clarifies how EPA believes that nonclassifiable (i.e., submarginal, transitional, and incomplete/no
data) ozone nonattainment areas which are outside the Northeast ozone transport region and have ambient monitoring
data demonstrating attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone may be exempted from the conformity
rules' nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) requirements. This notice also references a recent memorandum which states EPA's preliminary interpretation
for such ozone nonattainment areas which are classified as marginal or above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clarification of EPA policy for areas with monitoring data which demonstrates attainment is particularly important
because many areas already have such data and appear to qualify for exemption from the conformity NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid repetition, this General Preamble describes guidance on NOx exemptions with respect to the transportation
conformity rule. However, this guidance for transportation conformity is intended to also apply with respect to
general conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This General Preamble explains EPA's policy generally for future notice-and-comment rulemakings taking action
on requests for NOx exemptions for specific areas. It contains EPA's preliminary interpretations of relevant provisions
of the Clean Air Act and the conformity rules. The interpretations contained herein are not binding as a matter of law
until final rulemaking action is taken on each specific area. Opportunity for public comment on NOx exemption determinations
made by EPA will be provided separately for each area during these individual rulemakings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Transportation Conformity Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transportation conformity final rule, entitled ``Criteria and Procedures for Determining Conformity to State
or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Funded or Approved Under title
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act,'' was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). This action was required under section 176(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conformity to an implementation plan is defined in the Clean Air Act as conformity to an implementation plan's purpose
of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air quality standards and
achieving expeditious attainment of such standards. In addition, Federal activities may not cause or contribute
to new violations of air quality standards, exacerbate existing violations, or interfere with timely attainment
or required interim emission reductions towards attainment. The transportation conformity final rule establishes
the process by which the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration of the United States
Department of Transportation and metropolitan planning organizations determine the conformity of highway and
transit projects. Under the rule, conformity applies in nonattainment and maintenance areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transportation conformity rule requires ozone nonattainment and maintenance areas to perform a regional emissions
analysis of motor vehicle NOx emissions in order to determine the conformity of transportation plans and programs.
This analysis must demonstrate that the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions which would result from the transportation system if the proposed transportation plan and program were
implemented are within the total allowable level of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from highway and transit motor vehicles (``motor vehicle emissions budget''), as identified in a submitted
or approved attainment demonstration or maintenance plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until an attainment demonstration or (for nonclassifiable areas) a maintenance plan is approved by EPA, the regional
emissions analysis of the transportation system must also satisfy the ``build/no-build test.'' That is, the analysis
must demonstrate that emissions from the transportation system if the proposed transportation plan and program
were implemented would be less than the emissions from the transportation system if only the previously applicable
transportation plan and program were implemented. Furthermore, the regional emissions analysis must show that
emissions from the transportation system if the transportation plan and program were implemented would be lower
than 1990 levels by any nonzero amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transportation conformity rule as currently written provides for an exemption from these requirements with
respect to NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 if the Administrator determines under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act that additional reductions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not contribute to attainment. This exemption is explicitly referred to and is described in similar language
in &sect;51.394(b)(3)(i) (the ``Applicability'' section of the rule) and in the preamble (58 FR 62197, November
24, 1993). The language is repeated in the provisions of the rule regarding the motor vehicle emissions budget test
(&sect;51.428(a)(1)(ii)) and the ``build/no-build'' test (&sect;&sect;51.436(e), 51.438(e)), although Clean
Air Act section 182(f) is not specifically mentioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act contains requirements for_and in some cases, exemptions for_major stationary

x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources in marginal and above ozone nonattainment areas and in an ozone transport region. EPA guidance for application
of section 182(f) in these areas is briefly described and referenced in the next section of this preamble. Because
the transportation conformity rule covers all nonattainment areas_including nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment
areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
submarginal, transitional, incomplete/no data areas) that are not necessarily covered under section 182(f)_corresponding
guidance is needed for applying in these nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas the section 182(f) NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption referenced in the transportation conformity rule. This guidance is described below (section II, ``EPA
Policy'') and is consistent with the existing guidance that applies to the marginal and above areas outside an ozone
transport region. The substantive test for a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption is limited solely to the issue of whether such areas may be exempted from meeting the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements of the transportation conformity rule.

B. General Conformity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214), EPA published the general conformity final rule, entitled ``Determining Conformity
of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.'' This action was required under section 176(c)(4)
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the transportation conformity rule, the general conformity rule exempts an area from considering NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions if the area has been exempted under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (see definition of ``precursors of
a criteria pollutant,'' 58 FR 63248). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid repetition, this General Preamble describes guidance on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemptions with respect to the transportation conformity rule. However, this guidance for transportation conformity
is intended to also apply with respect to general conformity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires states to apply the reasonably available control technology (RACT) and
new source review (NSR) requirements that apply to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds to major
stationary sources of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well. NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NSR regulations are required in marginal and above ozone areas, as well as in all areas within an ozone transport region.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act section 182(f)(1)(A) states that, for nonattainment areas not within an ozone transport region (as
established under Clean Air Act section 184), these NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements shall not apply if the Administrator determines that additional reductions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not contribute to attainment of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone in the area. Furthermore,
for areas within an ozone transport region, section 182(f)(1)(B) states that these stationary source NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements shall not apply if additional NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions would not produce net ozone air quality benefits in the region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued limited guidance on section 182(f) exemptions in a September 17, 1993 memo from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, to the Regional Air Division Directors entitled, ``State Implementation
Plan (SIP) Requirements for Areas Submitting Requests for Redesignation to Attainment of the Ozone and Carbon Monoxide
(CO) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on or after November 15, 1992.'' EPA issued more extensive guidance
in a December 1993 document entitled, ``Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxide Requirements
under section 182(f).'' Most recently, EPA has clarified and, in part, revised its guidance in a May 27, 1994 memorandum
from John S. Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Regional Air Division Directors,
``Section 182(f) NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Exemptions_Revised Process and Criteria.'' All of these guidance documents are available by request from the contacts
listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taken together, these guidance documents state that if an area (not within an ozone transport region) has attained
the ozone standard, as demonstrated by adequate monitoring data consistent with EPA guidance, it is clear that additional
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions would not contribute to attainment. Therefore, such an area would meet the test under section 182(f)(1)(A)
for an exemption from NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X

A. Transportation Conformity and Section 182(f) Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transportation conformity rule states that its NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provisions do not apply when the Administrator has determined under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act that ``additional
reductions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not contribute to attainment.'' Although two other passages of the transportation conformity rule use this
language (which is borrowed from section 182(f)(1)(A)'s test for areas outside an ozone transport region) without
specifically referring to section 182(f), EPA believes there is no appropriate basis to interpret this identical
language differently under the transportation conformity rule than under the Clean Air Act. Consequently, EPA believes
this common language should be interpreted similarly for purposes of both section 182(f) and conformity NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemptions. Therefore, EPA is providing guidance which would exempt nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas
outside an ozone transport region from the conformity rule's NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 As explained in footnote 6 of the May 27, 1994 memorandum from John Seitz, referenced above, for purposes of the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption test, EPA is interpreting the term ``contribute to attainment'' to mean that the State (or petitioner)
need only show whether additional NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions would contribute to attainment, not whether such reductions would contribute to attainment and maintenance.
EPA believes that Congress could reasonably have believed it appropriate to require that States impose reasonably
available control technology (RACT) and new source review (NSR) requirements on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources for areas in nonattainment, but that the States could be left to decide for themselves whether to impose these
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 controls or other measures for maintenance purposes, even if these controls could ``contribute'' to maintenance.
EPA believes this rationale also applies in the conformity context, where EPA believes it is reasonable to allow States
that have attained the NAAQS to decide for themselves how best to ensure maintenance of the standard. And, as explained
below, EPA has conditioned the monitoring-based section 182(f) and conformity exemptions on continued monitoring
data that do not show violations of the NAAQS. This will provide an additional incentive for States to track NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions (and limit such emissions, where necessary) to ensure that future violations do not occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that its conclusion regarding the relevance of maintenance may well be different for other Clean Air Act
provisions where the test is whether emissions reduction measures are ``necessary'' for attainment, even if maintenance
is not explicitly mentioned. See section 211(c)(4)(C) (allowing States to overcome federal preemption of State
fuel controls where ``necessary'' to achieve a NAAQS) and section 184(c) (providing for EPA approval of ozone transport
commission recommendations of additional control measures ``necessary'' to bring any area in the region into attainment).
It may make less sense to disregard maintenance to disallow more stringent fuel controls under section 211 or to disapprove
additional controls under section 184 where these measures not only contribute to but are ``necessary'' for maintenance.
The rationale that the State might appropriately retain discretion to choose other options to ensure maintenance
makes less sense when the specific measures in question are ``necessary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transportation conformity rule applies to all nonattainment and maintenance areas, and does not distinguish
between nonclassifiable nonattainment and other nonattainment areas. Consequently, EPA interprets the transportation
conformity rule's reference to the need for nonattainment areas to obtain a section 182(f) exemption in order to be
relieved of the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 conformity requirements to include nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, submarginal, transitional, incomplete/no data areas), even though such areas are not subject to Clean Air Act section
182(f) itself. This means that ozone nonattainment areas, including nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas,
can only be exempted from the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provisions of the transportation conformity rule if EPA determines that the area satisfies the substantive test
required for an areawide section 182(f) exemption, through a process similar to that required for section 182(f)
exemptions which are not related to conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas outside the Northeast ozone transport region, EPA will consider
requests for determinations that additional NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions would not contribute to attainment if such areas already have air quality data that demonstrate attainment
of the ozone standard, that are consistent with 40 CFR part 58 requirements, and that are recorded in EPA's Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). Once made, this determination would relieve an area of the transportation
conformity rule's NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provisions. A more thorough explanation of the conditions and process for obtaining the 182(f) exemption is given
in the May 27, 1994 Seitz memorandum.

i.e.,

the exemption would last for only as long as the area's monitoring data continues to demonstrate attainment. If subsequently
it is determined that the area has violated the standard, the exemption, as of the date of the determination, would
no longer apply. EPA would notify the state that the exemption no longer applies, and would also provide notice to the
public in the

in accordance with 40 CFR part 58, to verify the attainment status of the area. The air quality data relied on for the
above determinations must be consistent with 40 CFR part 58 requirements and other relevant EPA guidance and recorded
in EPA's Aorometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS).

C. Areas Inside an Ozone Transport Region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act provides a different test for exempting areas in an ozone transport region from
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements (see section I.C. of this preamble). In particular, that test requires a demonstration that shows additional
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions would not produce net ozone benefits in the transport region as a whole. Since the requirement for meeting
this test is substantially different from that needed to meet the contribute-to-attainment test in section 182(f)(1)(A),
and since the language in the conformity rule clearly does not reflect the language of the test provided for areas in
an ozone transport region, the determination of how such areas would qualify for an exemption from the rule's NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements merits more consideration before EPA can issue appropriate guidance. Today's guidance therefore
applies only to NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemptions for areas outside the Ozone Transport Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, requests for conformity NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemptions must consider the nonattainment area as a whole. With respect to transportation conformity, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemptions will not be granted for portions of nonattainment areas. Therefore, nonattainment areas with portions
both inside and outside the Ozone Transport Region will be treated for purposes of such exemption requests as areas
inside the Ozone Transport Region, and for the present time, will not be eligible for an exemption based on monitoring
data as described in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will give further consideration to areas in the Ozone Transport Region, and if EPA does propose to exempt some of
these areas, they will be addressed in state-specific rulemaking notices unless another general preamble providing
guidance for such areas is published first.

 Exemption Based on Monitoring Data for Nonclassifiable Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that section 182(f) sets up two separate procedures by which EPA may act on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption requests. Subsections 182(f) (1) and (2) direct that action on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption determination requests should take place ``when [EPA] approves a plan or plan revision.'' This language
appears to contemplate that exemption requests submitted under these paragraphs are limited to states, since states
are the entities authorized under the Act to submit plans or plan revisions. By contrast, subsection 182(f)(3) provides
that ``person[s]
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 determination ``at any time'' after the ozone precursor study required under section 185B of the Act is finalized,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and gives EPA a limit of six months after filing to grant or deny such petitions. Although subsection 182(f)(3) references
section 182(f)(1), EPA believes that paragraph (f)(3)'s reference to paragraph (f)(1) encompasses only the substantive
tests in paragraph (f)(1) (and, by extension, paragraph (f)(2)), not the requirement in paragraph (f)(1) for EPA
to grant exemptions only when acting on plan revisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, petitions submitted under subsection 182(f)(3) are not required to be submitted as state implementation
plan (SIP) revisions. Consequently, the state is not required under the Act to hold a public hearing in order to petition
for an areawide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption determination under section 182(f)(3) (see Clean Air Act sections 110(a) (1) and (2)). For similar reasons,
if the state is submitting an areawide petition under subsection 182(f)(3), it is unnecessary to have the Governor
submit the petition. However, because of the need for consistency with the AIRS data and the requirements of 40 CFR
part 58, EPA believes that, particularly in cases where the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption request (including a request for exemption from the NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements of the conformity rules) is based on monitoring data, if such data is contained in a petition submitted
by a person other than the state, the petition should be coordinated with the state air agency. Lack of endorsement
by the state air agency will require more scrutiny by EPA, and therefore EPA's processing of the petition will likely
take more time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will grant or deny a petition for an areawide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transportation conformity exemption through a full rulemaking process. This may involve a direct final rule or a
notice of proposed rulemaking followed by a final rule. Either process allows opportunity for public comment. For
areas which are relying on monitoring data which demonstrates attainment, the notice and comment will provide opportunity
for comment on the preliminary interpretations contained in this General Preamble. These rulemakings will also
offer opportunity for comment on the appropriateness of using monitoring data which is consistent with the requirements
in 40 CFR part 58 and consistent with the data recorded in AIRS as the basis of EPA's approval and rescission of the contingent
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 exemption. If EPA issues a final rulemaking concluding that it will use such air quality monitoring data in making
subsequent determination that an area has violated the standard, no further notice and comment will be required in
order to rescind the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption in the event that such data subsequently indicates that a violation has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is preparing a delegation of authority to Regional Administrators to make determinations under section 182(f)
for areas which are outside the Ozone Transport Region and which have three years of monitoring data demonstrating
attainment. This delegation would allow the rulemaking for 182(f) determinations to be conducted by EPA's regional
offices.

Under EPA Contract 68&hyph;W3&hyph;0028, Industrial Economics, Inc., its subcontractors and its consultants
will assist the Communications Analyses and Budget Division of the Office of Solid Waste. The contractor will conduct
a wide range of quantitative policy analysis to support the RCRA program. These studies will involve development
of methods and cross-programmatic scoping studies. In particular, the contractor will conduct quantitative benefit
analyses. The economic impacts of the regulations will be assessed to help determine if industry sectors are significantly
impacted by facility closure. Confidential information submitted under 3007 of RCRA will be used to complete the
above-noted analyses. The CBI information will pertain to facility production process and waste management practices,
waste characteristics and constituent concentrations, waste volumes, waste management, treatment and disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 2.305(h), EPA has determined that Industrial Economics, Inc., its subcontractors and its
consultants, require access to CBI submitted to EPA under the authority of RCRA to perform work satisfactorily under
the above-noted contract. EPA is submitting this notice to inform all submitters of CBI that EPA may transfer to this
firm, on a need-to-know basis, CBI collected under the authority of RCRA. Upon completing their review of materials
submitted, Industrial Economics will return all such materials to EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial Economics, Inc., its subcontractors and its consultants have been authorized to have access to RCRA CBI
under the EPA ``Contractor Requirements for the Control and Security of RCRA Confidential Business Information
Security Manual.'' EPA will approve the security plan of the contractor and approve it prior to RCRA CBI being transmitted
to the contractor. Industrial Economics, Inc., its subcontractors and its consultants will be required to sign non-disclosure
agreements and be briefed on appropriate security procedures before they are permitted access to confidential information.

 FCC Form 702 is used to request Commission approval of assignment of radio station construction authorization or
license. Applicants are advised to refer to the governing rulepart before completing the form to determine whether
other showings are necessary in addition to those specified in the form. Also applicants may be called upon to produce
further showings in order for the Commission to make its determination. If the Commission consents to assignment,
it must be completed within 45 days of date of consent and the Commission must be notified within 10 days if a part 21 facility
is involved. The form has been revised to incorporate a certification required by the Commission's rules implementing
the provisions of Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The data will be used by the Commission staff to determine
the financial, legal and technical qualifications of the applicant.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Interpretive Ruling explains how the Federal Communications Commission requires radio stations involved
in time brokerage or multiple ownership circumstances to report employees on Annual Employment Reports, FCC Form
395&hyph;B. For licensees affected by the Interpretive Ruling, the Ruling extends the deadline for filing 1994 Form
395&hyph;B's. The former deadline of May 31, 1994, is extended to July 18, 1994. The FCC requires radio stations to
file a Form 395&hyph;B each year listing station employees for Equal Employment Opportunity purposes. The Interpretive
Ruling provides greater guidance about how employees should be reported by stations involved in a time brokerage
or by multiple stations owned by the same licensee in the same market.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Mass Media Bureau has before it a petition for an interpretive ruling regarding how the employees of radio station
time brokers should be reported on the FCC Form 395&hyph;B, Annual Employment Report for broadcast stations.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The request was filed on May 2, 1994, by the law firms of Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin &amp; Kahn; Hardy &amp; Carey;
and attorney David Tillotson (the Firms).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Firms allege that there are a variety of different factual situations involving time brokerage and different
ways in which employees engaged in providing brokered services could be reported. They request that the Commission
issue an interpretive ruling to clarify how employees in various situations should be reported.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Time brokerage is defined in 47 CFR 73.3555(a)(3)(iv) of the Commission's rules as ``the sale by a licensee of discrete
blocks of time to a `broker' that supplies the programming to fill that time and sells the commercial spot announcements
in it.'' A cognizable time brokerage agreement (often referred to as a ``Local Marketing Agreement'' or ``LMA'')
is a time brokerage agreement between two broadcast licensees of stations whose principal community contours overlap
and under which more than 15% of broadcast time per week of one station is brokered by the other station. If a brokerage
agreement is entered into by (1) a licensee and a non-licensee broker or (2) between two licensees in separate markets,
the agreement is not cognizable under Commission rules. See 47 CFR 73.3555(a)(2)(i).

II. Pleadings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Firms describe several specific situations and ask how reports should be filed for each. In the first example,
a broker is a licensee of another station in the same market as the brokered station to which the broker provides programming
services. In this case, all employees are employed by the licensee-broker, but some employees' duties relate exclusively
to the broker's station, some to the brokered station, and some to both stations. The Firms then analyze the merits
of various reporting methods. In the second example, a broker is not a licensee of a station in the same market as the
brokered station. Moreover, the broker may or may not be a Commission licensee. Again, while all employees are employed
by the broker, their duties relate variably to the broker's station (in the case of licensee-brokers), the brokered
station, or both. The Firms, as before, offer their analyses of various reporting methods. Finally, in a third example,
the Firms ask how shared employees should be reported where stations in the same radio service are under common ownership
or control in the same market, such as occurs where a licensee owns two FM stations in the same market.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In response to petitioners' request, this Interpretive Ruling sets forth general Commission policy on how to report
employees on Form 395&hyph;B for broadcast stations involved in time brokerage arrangements. As a general matter,
we believe that, consistent with the EEO Rule which measures licensee performance, employees hired in concert with
time brokerages and LMAs should be reported on the Form 395&hyph;B submitted by the licensee that employs them. Thus,
in the first example above, all employees hired and employed by the licensee-broker and whose duties include providing
program services or other duties in support of the LMA should, as a general matter, be reported on the 395&hyph;B filed
by the licensee-broker's station. This is because all such employees are either employed by, or under the control
of, the licensee-broker. The licensee of the brokered station should file a Form 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
395&hyph;B for any employees it may retain or hire after commencement of the brokerage agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In the second example above, whether the broker is a licensee or not, there is no cognizable brokerage agreement
because the broker does not hold an interest in a station in the same market as the brokered station. See 47 CFR 73.3555(a)(2)(i).
However, where the broker is a licensee, the reporting requirements are, as a general matter, no different from the
first example above. The licensee of the brokered station should file a Form 395&hyph;B for any employees it may retain
or hire after commencement of the brokerage agreement. Similarly, the licensee-broker should file a Form 395&hyph;B
for its employees. If personnel employed by the licensee-broker perform duties for both stations, the licensee-broker
should report them on its Form 395&hyph;B. If the licensee-broker employes personnel to work at the brokered station,
they should also be reported on the Form 395&hyph;B for the licensee-broker's station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. These policies are not inconsistent with prior Commission statements in Policy Statement on Part-time Programming,
82 FCC 2d 107, 115 (1980) (Policy Statement). The Policy Statement only considered whether employees of a non-licensee
time broker should be reported by licensees selling blocks of their airtime to brokers. The Commission declined to
require licensees of brokered stations to report employees of a non-licensee broker as part of the EEO employment
profile. Our ruling here merely indicates that, as a general matter, time brokers who are themselves licensees should
report individuals under their employ, whether they work at the licensee-broker's station or a station operated
by the broker under an LMA. The two rulings are, therefore, fully consistent. In addition, the Policy Statement was
directed at the typical time brokerage existing in 1980, which involved the brokerage by non-licensees of short,
discrete periods of broadcast time. The more common practice today is for large blocks of time or the entire programming
schedule of a station to be brokered. When that practice is engaged in by a licensee-broker, we believe it generally
appropriate that the licensee-broker comply with the EEO Rule and its attendant reporting obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In accordance with the reasoning set forth in Policy Statement, if the broker is not a licensee, as in the second example
above, the broker is not required to file a Form 395&hyph;B. However, we will closely watch to see that such agreements
are not used to circumvent our EEO Rule and policies.

7. Turning to the third example outlined by petitioners involving the reporting of shared employees of commonly owned
stations in the same radio service in the same market, current data processing technology available to the Commission
does not allow for the employment profile of more than one station to be reported on the same Form 395&hyph;B except
in cases involving an AM/FM combination. Therefore, if a licensee owns two FM stations or two AM stations in the same
market, the licensee should file a separate report for each station, dividing employees between the stations according
to their primary duties. If the duties of one or more employees involve work for both stations equally the licensee
should file a Form 395&hyph;B for one station with all employees from both stations listed. It should then file a separate
Form 395&hyph;B for the other station explaining that the station's employees are reported on the Form 395&hyph;B
filed for the licensee's other station in the same market. We expect the licensees of multiple stations in the same
market to file the Form 395&hyph;B attributing employees to the stations according to the manner in which the stations
operate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As of January 6, 1994, the Federal Communications Commission has renewed for two years the charter for an advisory
committee, the ``Network Reliability Council,'' and has also subsequently amended its charter. As amended, the
charter directs the committee to provide recommendations to the Commission and to the industry on the effects of increasing
interconnection and new technologies on telecommunications reliability, review the recommendations contained
in the industry publication, ``Network Reliability: A Report to the Nation,'' propose guidelines that will enhance
availability of essential telecommunications services, such as E911, during network outages and collect data on
whether network outages have disproportionate geographic or demographic impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to ensure a balanced membership on the Council, the Commission has carefully selected members on the basis
of their technical knowledge and the significance of questions of network reliability for their organizations and
for those they represent. Any new members will be chosen so that the largest possible diversity of interests, given
the function to be performed, will continue to be represented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The continuation of the advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest to prepare and evaluate recommendations
to the industry and to the FCC for avoiding, and minimizing the impact of, future network outages, to monitor and encourage
the implementation of its prior recommendations by the telecommunications industry, and to assess the effectiveness
of the implemented recommendations on network access during outages.

conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied

any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating

This final order prohibits the respondents from making misrepresentations about any material terms or conditions
of any automobile service contract, from cancelling service contracts when they have not disclosed that they have
a right to do so before selling the contract, from substantially hindering customers from performing a condition
on obtaining a benefit, from denying valid claims, and from refusing to comply promptly with any term or condition
of any service contract they sell. In addition, the order requires the respondents to disclose to potential buyers
whether the contracts cover the full cost of repairs, whether they include a rental car allowance, and the number and
total dollar value of claims that may be submitted.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This order reopens the proceeding and modifies the Commission's consent order issued on August 6, 1990, by deleting
the requirement to lease to a third party the rabies vaccine business that the company acquired when it purchased Connaught
BioSciences, Inc. The Commission concluded that the record does not show any approvable lessee despite Merieux's
efforts to find one, and that retaining the lease requirement imposes significant costs on Merieux and could result
in adverse impact on public health needs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)
announce the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a sole source cooperative agreement with the Minority
Health Professions Foundation (MHPF) and its member institutions to assist them in expanding and enhancing their
educational and research opportunities for minorities and disadvantaged students. Approximately $1,000,000
is available in FY 1994 to fund the Minority Health Professions Foundation. It is expected that the award will begin
on or about September 29, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to five years.
Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on
the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to continue assisting the MHPF Institutions to: (1) increase the number
of minority health professionals in public health; (2) improve the health status for minority and disadvantaged
persons; (3) expand health services to underserved populations; (4) increase research in minority health; and (5)
enhance both didactic curricula and practical experience for students at the member institutions and strengthen
the curricula of the school. Students will be better prepared to improve the health status of minorities and disadvantaged
people and be more focused as a centralized group of minority health professionals to implement the strategies for
health promotion/disease prevention. Further, this will encourage public health research among investigators
at all member institutions of the MHPF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CDC will: (1) Collaborate with MHPF and member institutions in expanding the opportunities for faculty, staff
and students for field experience in environmental and occupational health, and preventive medicine public health;
(2) Collaborate with MHPF to help identify research issues that its member institutions are uniquely able to investigate
related to the ``Healthy People 2000'' National Health Objectives; (3) Assist the MHPF with the activities of member
medical, dental, pharmacy and veterinary medical schools in strengthening their research infrastructure; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assist the MHPF in working with medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary medical schools and public health agencies
in strengthening instruction in the theory and practice of disease prevention and health promotion; (5) Provide
technical assistance to MHPF in developing, coordinating, and distributing, and evaluating instructional materials
for preventive practices and clinical preventive services; (6) Provide technical assistance to MHPF in (i) the publication
of a professional journal, (ii) the distribution of information on graduate programs in public health, and (iii)
recruitment of professionals, especially those who represent minority groups; (7) Assist the MHPF in information
exchange through conferences and workshops on instruction, practice, and research in environmental, medical,
and public health objectives listed in ``Healthy People 2000''; and (8) Collaborate with MHPF in the implementation
of the program activities under this agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the statutory general funding preference and final
funding priority for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine authorized
under the authority of section 747(b) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, title VII, as amended by the Health Professions
Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 747(b) of the PHS Act authorizes support to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to meet the costs
of projects to establish, maintain, or improve family medicine academic administrative units (which may be departments,
divisions, or other units) to provide clinical instruction in family medicine. Funds awarded will be used to: (1)
Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in
family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b)
support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the
planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine
activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family
medicine training programs under section 747(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory General Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above
the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group.

Establishment and Expansion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Public Law 102&hyph;408 has amended section 747(b) to include the following statutory funding preference
for this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 747(b)(2) provides that preference shall be given to any qualified applicant that agrees to expend the award
for one of the following purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Establishing an academic administrative unit (defined as a department, division, or other unit), for programs
in family medicine; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) substantially expanding the programs of such a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A program will meet the definition of ``substantial expansion'' if it has developed an acceptable plan for a 50 percent
increase in a sufficient number of the following areas to qualify for 70 points. The expansion must be completed within
3 years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference and final
funding priority and special consideration for fiscal year (FY) 1994 for Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family
Medicine authorized under the authority of section 747(a), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended
by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 747(a) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the award of grants to assist in meeting the cost of planning,
developing and operating or participating in approved predoctoral training programs in the field of family medicine.
Grants may include support for the program only or support for both the program and the trainees.

General Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the peer
review group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A proposed notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 5, 1993 at 58 FR 51836 for public comment. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. Therefore,
the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'', final funding priority
and special consideration for this program will be retained as follows:

Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates of the medical school in academic year 1988&hyph;89
or 1989&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that the rate of placing academic year 1989&hyph;90 graduates in the specified
settings is at least 50 percent higher than the rate of placing academic year 1988&hyph;89 graduates in such settings
and that not less than 15 percent of academic year 1989&hyph;90 graduates are working in these areas. Academic years
1988&hyph;89 and 1989&hyph;90 are used because they are the two most recent years that medical school graduates would
have entered practice following the completion of residency training.

General Program Goals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. To support practice and community-based research projects likely to improve the health of American Indians and
Alaska Natives (AI/AN) served by the IHS. Projects that are basic science or laboratory research are not considered
as conforming to the program goals, and will be returned to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To develop research skills among IHS and tribal health professional. The applicant, as the direct and primary recipient
of PHS funds, must perform a substantive role in carrying out project activities and not merely serve as a conduit for
an award to another party, or to provide funds to another party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. These grants will be awarded and administered in accordance with the published program announcement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications meeting eligibility requirements that are complete and conform to the published program announcement
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12964) will be reviewed in accordance with the following process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Review by authorized Institutional Review Boards (IRB). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications involving human subjects will be reviewed by the authorized Area or National IRBs in the IHS for compliance
with requirements to protect human subjects contained in 45 CFR 46, and as specified in the IHS Multiple Project Assurance
(MPA). It is suggested but not required that the application be sent to the appropriate Area IRB(s) two months before
the deadline, for the IRB review of the proposal to permit making the changes before the final submission. The IRB will
review only IRB issues, not purely technical methods. Any applications involving investigators from institutions
with IRBs with MPAs and involving human subjects must also be reviewed by the IRBs of the respective institution(s).
The researcher should contact non-IHS IRBs for their deadline requirements. No research project can be funded by
IHS unless it has been approved by, and has met the conditions of, all applicable IRBs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Review by the Indian Health Research Study Section (IHRSS). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications meeting eligibility requirements that are complete, responsive, and conform to this program announcement
will be reviewed for merit by the IHRSS appointed by the IHS to review these applications. The IHRSS review will be conducted
in accordance with the IHS objective review procedures. The technical review process ensures selection of quality
research projects in a national competition for limited funding. The IHRSS will include at least 60 percent non-IHS,
Federal or non-Federal, individuals, all experts in research. For each application, the IHRSS will decide to disapprove,
or to defer pending more information, or to approve the project. If the IHRSS decides to approve the project, it will
review the application against established criteria, and will assign a numerical score to the application. The members
of the IHRSS will use the following criteria and weights to make the score.

During the month of May 1994, the HHS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Inspector General imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions in the cases set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an exclusion is imposed, no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is made to anyone for any items or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services (other than an emergency item or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service not provided in a hospital emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded party under the Medicare, Medicaid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant and Block Grants to States for Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Services programs. In addition, no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is made to any business or facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e.g., a hospital, that submits bills for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for items or services provided by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free to decide for themselves whether they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to use the services of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded party even though no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments will be made for items and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by that excluded party. The exclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have national effect and also apply to all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal non-procurement programs.

Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;422); (2) certain Amerasians from Vietnam who are admitted to the
U.S. as immigrants under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations
Act, 1988, as included in the FY 1988 Continuing Resolution (Pub. L. 100&hyph;202); and (3) certain Amerasians from

not eligible to be served under the social service program (or under other programs supported by Federal refugee funds)
during their period of coverage under their sponsoring agency's agreement with the Department of State_usually
two years from their date of arrival or until they obtain permanent resident alien status, whichever comes first.

 This notice establishes the allocations to States of FY 1994 funds for social services under the Refugee Resettlement
Program (RRP). In order to help meet the special needs of former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director has
added to the formula allocation $2,000,000 in funds previously set aside for social services discretionary projects.
This notice eliminates the set-aside for mutual assistance associations (MAAs) as a separate component of the social
service allocations.

 Notice of the proposed social service allocations to States was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11794). The population estimates that were used in the proposed notice have been adjusted as
a result of additional population information submitted by 7 States.

I. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$80,802,000 in FY 1994 refugee social service funds as part of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health
and Human Services (Pub. L. 103&hyph;112). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the total of $80,802,000, the Director of ORR will make available to States $68,681,700 (85%) under the allocation
formula set out in this notice. These funds would be made available for the purpose of providing social services to
refugees. In addition, the Director of ORR is making available $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds
to be allocated under the formula in this notice for additional services to former political prisoners from Vietnam.
ORR intends FY 1994 to be the last year in which a special set-aside will be allocated for additional services for former
political prisoners from Vietnam. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Discretionary Social Service Funds for Vietnamese Political Prisoners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recognition of the special vulnerability of refugees who are former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director
of ORR has set aside $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds to be allocated under the formula set forth
in this announcement, based on the number of actual political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993. This formula allocation
is shown separately in Table 1 (cols. 7 and 8). States are required to use this allocation to provide additional services,
as described below, to recent arrivals from Vietnam who are former political prisoners and members of their families.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable services for the above-cited funds for political prisoners include the following direct services: (1)
Specialized orientation and adjustment services, including peer support activities; and (2) specialized employment-related
services, as needed. Adjustment services include any service listed under 45 CFR 400.155(c) of the ORR regulations.
Under no circumstances may these funds be used for direct cash payments or stipends, or for the purchase of advertising
space or air time.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allowable services under this allocation for Vietnamese political prisoners are intended to supplement, not to
supplant, those services provided to refugees in general under the social service formula allocation, discussed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR intends to provide technical assistance to States and organizations that request it to assure effective program
development and implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these funds are being provided specifically for services for former political prisoners from Vietnam, States
which allocate social service funds to other local administrative jurisdictions, such as counties, shall do so for
these funds, using a formula which reflects arrivals of this target population during FY 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR strongly encourages States and other contracting jurisdictions, in selecting service providers for the above,
to award these funds, to the extent possible, to qualified refugee mutual assistance associations with experience
serving the target population. All contractors receiving these funds should have Vietnamese language capacity
and Vietnamese cultural understanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are required to provide to ORR program performance information on the Vietnamese political prisoner program
that meets the reporting requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services
grant awards to States. The information to be contained in the narrative portion of State quarterly performance reports
must include: (1) Names of service contractors; (2) categories of activities provided; (3) numbers of persons served;
and (4) outcomes, to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Refugee Social Service Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The population figures for the social service allocation include refugees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Amerasians
from Vietnam since these populations may be served through funds addressed in this notice. (A State must, however,
have an approved State plan for the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program in order to use funds on behalf of entrants as well
as refugees.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director will allocate $68,681,700 to States on the basis of each State's proportion of the national population
of refugees who had been in the U.S. 3 years or less as of October 1, 1993 (including a floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the 3-year population base in the allocation formula is required by section 412(c)(1)(B) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA) which states that the ``funds available for a fiscal year for grants and contracts [for social
services] *&blank;*&blank;*. shall be allocated among the States based on the total number of refugees (including
children and adults) who arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginning of such fiscal year
and who are actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal
year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As established in the FY 1991 social services notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 29, 1991, section I, ``Allocation Amounts'' (56 FR 42745), a variable floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations is calculated as follows: If the application of the regular allocation formula yields
less than $100,000, then_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) a base amount of $75,000 is provided for a State with a population of 50 or fewer refugees who have been in the U.S.
3 years or less; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For a State with more than 50 refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less: (a) A floor has been calculated consisting
of $50,000 plus the regular per capita allocation for refugees above 50 up to a total of $100,000 (in other words, the
maximum under the floor formula is $100,000); (b) if this calculation has yielded less than $75,000, a base amount
of $75,000 is provided for the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR has consistently supported floors for small States in order to provide sufficient funds to carry out a minimum
service program. Given the range in numbers of refugees in the small States, we have concluded that a variable floor,
as established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FY 1991 notice, will be more reflective of needs than previous across-the-board floors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $12,120,300 in remaining social service funds (15% of the total funds available) will be used by ORR on a discretionary
basis to provide funds for individual projects intended to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the
refugee resettlement program. Grant announcements on discretionary initiatives will be issued separately.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Population To Be Served 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the allocation formula is based on the 3-year refugee population, in accordance with the requirements of
45 CFR Part 400 Subpart I_Refugee Social Services, States are not required to limit social service programs to refugees
who have been in the U.S. only 3 years. In keeping with 45 CFR 400.147(a), a State must allocate an appropriate portion
of its social service funds, based on population and service needs, as determined by the State, for services to newly
arriving refugees who have been in the U.S. less than one year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While 45 CFR 400.147(b) requires that in providing employability services, a State must give priority to a refugee
who is receiving cash assistance, social service programs should not be limited exclusively to refugees who are cash
assistance recipients. If a State intends to provide services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years,
45 CFR 400.147(c) requires the State to specify and justify as part of its Annual Services Plan those funds that it proposes
to use to provide services to those refugees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR expects States to ensure that refugee social services are made available to special populations such as Amerasians
and former political prisoners from Vietnam, in addition to special funding that ORR may designate to address the
special needs of these populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR funds may not be used to provide services to United States citizens, since they are not covered under the authorizing
legislation, with the following exceptions: (1) Under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.208, services may be provided
to a U.S.-born minor child in a family in which both parents are refugees or, if only one parent is present, in which that
parent is a refugee; and (2) under the FY 1989 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations
Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;461), services may be provided to an Amerasian from Vietnam who is a U.S. citizen and who enters
the U.S. after October 1, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Service Priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Refugee social service funding should be used to assist refugee families to achieve economic independence. To this
end, ORR expects States to ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses
the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. Each service plan should address
a family's needs for both employment-related services and other needed social services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director expects States to ``insure that women have the same
opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make sure
that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure
adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects
States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage
earners in a family unit, particularly in the case of large families. States are expected to make every effort to assure
the availability of day care services in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment
services or to accept or retain employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related
service under the refugee social services program. Refugees who are participating in employment services or have
accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, day care funded by refugee social
service dollars must be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States are expected to use day care
funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are expected to work with service providers
to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 45 CFR 400.146, if a State's cash assistance dependency rate for refugees (as defined in &sect;400.146(b))
is 55% or more, funds awarded under this notice (with the exception of the political prisoner set-aside) are subject
to a requirement that at least 85% of the State's award be used for employability services as set forth in &sect;400.154.
ORR expects these funds to be used for services which directly enhance refugee employment potential, have specific
employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs in less than one year as part of a plan to achieve
self-sufficiency. This reflects the Congressional objective that ``employable refugees should be placed on jobs
as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States'' and that social service funds be focused on ``employment-related
services, English-as-a-second-language training (in non-work hours where possible), and case-management services''
(INA, &sect;412(a)(1)(B)). If refugee social service funds are used for the provision of English language training,
such training should be provided concurrently, rather than sequentially, with employment or with other employment-related
services, to the maximum extent possible. ORR also encourages the continued provision of services after a refugee
has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since current welfare dependency data are not available, those States that historically have had dependency rates
at 55% and above are invited to submit a request for a waiver of the 85% requirement if they can provide reliable documentation
that demonstrates a lower dependency rate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORR will consider granting a waiver of the 85% provision if a State meets one of the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR that the dependency rate of refugees who have been
in the U.S. 24 months or less is below 55% in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that (a) less than 85% of the State's social service allocation
is sufficient to meet all employment-related needs of the State's refugees and (b) there are non-employment-related
service needs which are so extreme as to justify an allowance above the basic 15%. Or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the INA, the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or in
consultation with local governments) which the Director determines provides for the maximum appropriate provision
of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance
standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refugee social services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's
language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling
in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically
appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's
initial years of resettlement, refugee social services should be provided through a refugee-specific service system
rather than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. When planning State
refugee services, States are strongly encouraged to take into account the reception and placement (R &amp; P) services
provided by local resettlement agencies in order to utilize these resources in the overall program design and to ensure
the provision of seamless services to refugees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as possible
in a time of limited resources, ORR encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration to the
provision of refugee social services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of
MAAs, voluntary resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving
organizations to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately
to a changing refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in
communities with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of
funding for services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States should also expect to use funds available under this notice to pay for social services which are provided to
refugees who participate in alternative projects. Section 412(e)(7)(A) of the INA provides that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary [of HHS] shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States
less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support [social]
services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency,
and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision is generally known as the Wilson/Fish Amendment. The Department has already issued a separate notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with respect to applications for such projects (50 FR 24583, June 11, 1985). The notice on alternative projects does
not contain provisions for the allocation of additional social service funds beyond the amounts established in this
notice. Therefore a State which may wish to consider carrying out such a project should take note of this in planning
its use of social service funds being allocated under the present notice.

Funding to MAAs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORR has eliminated the set-aside for refugee mutual assistance associations as a separate component under the social
service notice and instead has folded these funds into the social service formula allocation to States. Elimination
of the MAA set-aside, however, is not intended to represent any reduction in ORR's commitment to MAAs as important
participants in refugee resettlement. ORR believes that the continued and/or increased utilization of qualified
refugee mutual assistance associations in the delivery of social services helps to ensure the provision of culturally
and linguistically appropriate services as well as increasing the effectiveness of the overall service system.
Therefore, at a minimum, ORR expects States to continue to use MAAs as service providers at a level comparable to previous
years. ORR strongly encourages States when contracting for services, including employment services, to give consideration
to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally qualified, provided that the MAA
has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with the background
of the target population to be served. ORR also expects States to continue to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or
private funds for the provision of services to refugee clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The organization is legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association
is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women.

States are reminded that under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.206 and 400.207, States have the flexibility to charge
the following types of administrative costs against their refugee program social service grants, if they so choose:
Direct and indirect administrative costs incurred for the overall management and operation of the State refugee
program, including its coordination, planning, policy and program development, oversight and monitoring, data
collection and reporting, and travel. See also State Transmittal No. 88&hyph;40.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received 17 letters of comment in response to the notice of proposed FY 1994 allocations to States for refugee social
services. The comments are summarized below and are followed in each case by the Department's response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourteen commenters expressed their views regarding the proposed elimination of the MAA set-aside. Eleven commenters
expressed concern over the proposed elimination of the MAA set-aside, while two commenters supported the elimination.
One commenter was concerned that without the Federal requirement for a set-aside, the State would not be able to continue
a State MAA set-aside in order to adhere to its general procurement requirements for contracting for social services.
One commenter felt that the MAA set-aside represents the only structure through which ORR can recognize the role of
MAAs in refugee resettlement. Another commenter felt that elimination of the set-aside reflected a distancing of
ORR from the MAAs and did not create a level playing field for MAAs. Five commenters felt that elimination of the set-aside
would represent a hardship on MAAs and would preclude MAAs from receiving any State social service funding. One commenter
felt that there would be public pressure on States to award the exact amount of previous set-asides to MAAs and would
create the need for a new tracking system to document the level of funding to MAAs to compare MAA funding with previous
set-asides. One commenter asked for clarification on whether ORR will continue to require States to assist MAAs to
seek other public and/or private funds as it has in the past. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elimination of the MAA set-aside is not intended to convey a diminution of ORR's commitment to MAAs. We continue
to believe in the importance of the role of MAAs in service provision and firmly believe that the involvement of MAAs
is essential to effective refugee resettlement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORR first instituted a set-aside for MAAs over 10 years ago as an incentive to States to work with and fund MAAs. At that
time, MAAs were emerging as important organizations in the refugee resettlement field. We felt that States needed
to be encouraged to begin funding these organizations as service providers. Today, the situation is quite different;
we believe that MAAs are now in a position to compete effectively for refugee social services funds. Many MAAs have
succeeded in becoming highly qualified and experienced service agencies and, in many States, have been able to obtain
a much higher level of refugee social service funding than is available under the MAA set-aside. For this reason, we
believe the MAA set-aside has served its purpose and should be discontinued at the Federal level. This in no way suggests
that States should lower their commitment to using MAAs to provide services to refugees; to the contrary, we expect
and encourage States to continue to use MAAs as service providers at levels comparable to previous years. In addition,
MAAs may compete for funding under ORR's discretionary programs which are open to nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We inadvertently deleted the language that has appeared in previous notices requiring States to assist MAAs in seeking
other public and/or private funds for the provision of services to refugee clients. We have included similar language
in this notice which strongly encourages, but does not require, States to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or
private funds for the provision of services.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters requested clarification regarding ORR's expectation that States should ensure that refugee social
services are provided to special populations such as Amerasians and former political prisoners from Vietnam. One
commenter made the point that all refugees are special populations. Another commenter felt that while a State can
ensure that services are made available to special populations, a State cannot ensure that services are provided,
since it cannot ensure that refugees will access the services offered. The commenter suggested that the language
in the notice be revised to acknowledge this distinction.

 The phrase ``such as'' is not intended to suggest an inclusive list of special populations, but simply to provide examples
of such special populations. We agree that States can only ensure that services are made available to refugees. The
language in the notice has been changed to reflect ORR's expectation that States should ensure that refugee social
services are made available to special populations.

Two commenters requested clarification regarding ORR's expectation that States should ensure that a coherent plan
of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment
of economic independence. One commenter pointed out that a plan of services can only be developed for individuals
and families that access services and recommended that the language in the notice be revised to clarify this point.
The commenter also questioned how the definition of an ``eligible family'' would apply to recent arrivals who are
single. Another commenter questioned what is meant by ``a coherent plan of services from time of arrival until attainment
of economic independence''.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Our intent regarding a coherent plan of services is for such a plan to be developed for every family that applies for
services or receives cash assistance. We believe that a State can ensure that this is carried out by requiring its providers
to develop such plans. Refugees who are single individuals, without family, should be considered an eligible one-person
family unit. ``A coherent plan of services from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence'' means
the development of a comprehensive service plan that includes the provision of employment-related and other services
needed to help a newly arrived family move to a point of economic self-support.

 Three commenters commented on ORR's expectation that services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and
linguistically compatible. Two of the commenters indicated that this expectation would require the provision of
services through a refugee-specific system which, they felt, would be financially impractical. Both commenters
felt that it would be more cost-effective to fold refugee services into the existing mainstream system. Another commenter
expressed support for the provision of services through a refugee-specific system. One commenter asked for a clear
definition of what ``culturally and linguistically compatible'' means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 What ORR means by the provision of services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible is that an
agency providing refugee social services must employ or contract with staff who (1) speak the native language of and
(2) are either from the same ethnic background as, or are culturally knowledgeable of, the refugee populations the
agency serves, and must use these staff in the provision of services to refugee clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the cost-effectiveness of a refugee-specific service system, we believe that the investment of refugee
program funds in a refugee-specific service system, particularly in the initial years after a refugee's arrival
in the U.S., will prove to be more cost-effective in the long run than serving refugees through a mainstream system.
The provision of services through a service provider system whose only clientele is refugees is likely to result in
more tailored and comprehensive services to refugees, resulting, we believe, in earlier employment and self-sufficiency
than what would otherwise occur when refugees are served through a mainstream system. Refugees often tend to receive
minimal services or are the last to be served in mainstream systems where they are one of many client groups served.
We wish to emphasize, however, that there is nothing to preclude, and in fact we encourage, the use of mainstream resources
to augment the services provided through a refugee-specific service system.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters had concerns regarding ORR's encouragement to States and counties to give special consideration
to coalitions of refugee service organizations. One commenter expressed concern about how coalitions would be more
cost-effective. The commenter also questioned how ORR envisions special consideration for coalitions in relation
to the competitive procurement process. Another commenter felt that coordination should not be mandated as an end
in itself. The commenter felt that if early employment is the goal, local service systems should be as uncomplicated
as possible in order to get the job done efficiently. The commenter was concerned that current providers that are doing
an effective job would be dismantled prematurely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the formation of coalitions among refugee service agencies ought to lead to service delivery efficiencies
and to a rational downsizing of existing systems that will be necessary to keep pace with the changing nature of the
refugee population to be served. We believe the formation of coalitions will enable the pooling of varied talents
and skills within the agencies to more efficiently serve the changing population of refugee arrivals that will occur
over the next few years. We also believe that the formation of coalitions should result in the reduction of administrative
costs such as accounting and reporting costs, making coalitions more competitive. In addition, we believe the formation
of coalitions will result in better coordination of services to refugees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Encouragement of or special consideration for coalitions should not interfere with State procurement requirements.
Coalitions will have to compete along with other applicants. However, States in their Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
could choose to include language that encourages the formation of coalitions or could include bonus points for coalitions
in the scoring criteria, as long as these actions do not violate State procurement rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters made comments regarding requirements for the use of discretionary funds for services to former political
prisoners (FPP) from Vietnam. One commenter requested that ORR specify which family members are eligible for services
under the FPP set-aside or allow States and counties to make that determination. The commenter also requested that
ORR define what adjustment services may be provided under the FPP program and recommended that ORR use the same definition
as used in 45 CFR 400.155(c) of the ORR regulations. One commenter, noting ORR's prohibition against the purchase
of advertising space and air time with FPP funds, recommended that paid outreach announcements through refugee community
media and Vietnamese newspapers be allowed under the FPP program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that ORR requires States to allocate FPP funds using a formula that reflects recent and anticipated
arrivals of former political prisoners. The commenter pointed out that there is no timely or reliable source of anticipated
arrivals by State and recommended limiting the State allocation formula to recent arrivals and recommended defining
the term ``recent arrivals.'' One commenter recommended that counties which administer FPP programs be granted
10% for administrative costs and that States should be limited to no more than 2% for administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended dropping outcomes as a performance reporting requirement under the FPP program. One
of the commenters questioned the increased reporting requirements when the FPP program is entering its last year
of operation. Another commenter recommended accepting available individual contract data on outcomes since it
would be difficult in some States with a wide range of FPP services to provide a program-wide outcomes report. One commenter
supported the proposed FPP reporting requirements and did not feel the increased reporting requirements would add
significantly to existing workloads. Another commenter recommended that FPP projects be supported that demonstrate
accountability for outcomes such as those that occurred in the Amerasian projects. The commenter further suggested
that ORR should require coordination between the agencies that provide FPP services and the voluntary agencies that
resettle former political prisoners.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Family members who are eligible for services under the FPP set-aside include any relative of a former political prisoner
who lives in the same household with the FPP. Adjustment services are defined as those services listed under 45 CFR
400.155(c) of the ORR regulations. This definition is included in this notice. Regarding the use of FPP funds for paid
outreach announcements through the refugee media, our position is unchanged on this issue; we do not feel that the
purchase of advertising space and air time constitutes an effective use of FPP funds. FPP providers should work with
the voluntary agencies that resettled FPP refugees to contact these refugees within the constraints of the Privacy
Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the comment regarding the difficulty of basing a State allocation formula on anticipated arrivals and
have dropped this factor from the formula. In the interest of consistency, we have changed the notice to require States
to allocate FPP funds using a formula which reflects arrivals during FY 1993 to local jurisdictions, the same formula
used by ORR to allocate FPP funds to States. We have no specific guidance regarding the distribution of administrative
costs between county and State; this is an issue that should be resolved between the county and the State. All costs
claimed against grants must be in conformity with HHS grants regulations at 45 CFR part 92 and other applicable Federal
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to performance requirements for the FPP program, we have not added any new reporting requirements. As in
FY 1993, States are required to provide program performance information on the FPP program consistent with the reporting
requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services grant awards to States.
In addition, we have simply clarified that the information to be reported must include the four items listed in this
notice. Regarding program outcomes, States may provide available outcome data from individual contracts. In regard
to suggestions for additional requirements for FPP projects, we have decided not to consider additional requirements
since this is the last year of the FPP set-aside program.

 Five commenters addressed the issue of ORR's use of 15% of social service funds for ORR discretionary grants. Two commenters
indicated support for the 15% discretionary use, while two commenters objected it. One commenter recommended that
there should be equitable distribution of discretionary funding with input and involvement of States, an expansion
of selection panels, more lead time to develop proposals, and the development of meaningful evaluation criteria.
Another commenter felt that the notice should describe the focus of discretionary funds for FY 1994, as has been done
in previous years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We continue to believe that it is necessary to maintain a portion of social service funds for discretionary use in order
to carry out national initiatives and special projects that respond to changing needs and circumstances in the refugee
program. Regarding the issue of equitable distribution, discretionary funds are awarded on a competitive basis,
based on the quality of applications in relation to the evaluation criteria, rather than on the basis of a population-based
allocation formula. Therefore, the geographic distribution of funds awarded on the basis of merit may not be the same
as a distribution by formula. Regarding more State involvement in discretionary funding, since States are frequently
competitors for ORR discretionary funds, along with other applicants, it is not possible to involve States in funding
decisions without creating a conflict of interest, a violation of Federal grant rules. We do not believe our selection
panels need to be expanded; ORR selection panels have traditionally been broad-based, involving a varied group of
experts from the resettlement field and other disciplines. We agree that sufficient lead time is necessary to develop
proposals; we are committed to allowing as much lead time as the grant process timetable will bear. We also agree that
the use of meaningful evaluation criteria is essential in the review of grant applications; such evaluation criteria
are included in our grant announcements. We have not included a description of our discretionary focus for FY 1994
because we have been in the process of revamping our discretionary program agenda this year. FY 1994 grant announcements
have recently been made available in the

We do not believe that English language training should be tied exclusively to one type of employment-related service
such as vocational training. Our intent is to encourage the concurrent provision of English language training in
concert with other employment-related services to speed the process of a refugee becoming employed and self-sufficient.
At the same time, we want to discourage the provision of English language training in a sequential manner, as a prerequisite
to receiving other employment-related services.

 Appropriate coordination means working with R &amp; P agencies to ensure that there is a smooth transition between
services provided by the R &amp; P agencies and services provided to refugees through the State program. When planning
services, a State should take into account what services are provided by R &amp; P agencies so that there is a relationship
and a continuum between R &amp; P services and State-funded services and an absence of service gaps or service duplication.

specified and justified as part of a State's annual services plan. This regulation has been in effect since July 1,

 We believe the notice is clear that social services funds may be used to serve non-cash-assistance recipients. The
notice, under the section ``Population to be Served,'' states that ``social service programs should not be limited
exclusively to refugees who are cash assistance recipients.'' However, as the wording indicates, this is not a mandatory
requirement. States are not required to ensure that cash assistance recipients make up a percentage of the social
services caseload that is not less than the State's welfare dependency rate. States, however, are required to give
priority to a refugee who is receiving cash assistance.

 Since the statute does not specify a limitation on the amount of social service funds that can be used for administrative

to the percentage of funds that counties may use for administrative costs, this is an issue that needs to be resolved

III. Allocation Formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the funds available for FY 1994 for social services, $68,681,700 is allocated to States in accordance with the formula
specified below. A State's allowable allocation is calculated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be available for this purpose; divided by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The total number of refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants who arrived in the United States not more than 3 years prior
to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funds are appropriated and the number of Amerasians from Vietnam eligible
for refugee social services, as shown by the ORR Refugee Data System. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied
by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The number of persons in item 2, above, in the State as of October 1, 1993, adjusted for estimated secondary migration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculation above yields the formula allocation for each State. Minimum allocations for small States are taken
into account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocations for political prisoners are based on FY 1993 arrival numbers for this group in each State from the Refugee
Data Center and are limited to States with 170 or more political prisoner arrivals. We have limited the population
base to FY 1993 political prisoner arrival numbers because these funds are intended to serve recent arrivals. We have
not included States with fewer than 170 former political prisoners in the political prisoner allocations formula
because the resulting level of funding would be insignificant. In these States, we believe the small number of political
prisoners could be adequately served under the State's refugee social services program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Basis of Population Estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1994 are based on data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee
Data System, adjusted as of October 1, 1993, for estimated secondary migration. The data base includes refugees of
all nationalities, Amerasians from Vietnam, and Cuban and Haitian entrants.

For fiscal year 1994, ORR's formula allocations for the States for social services are based on the numbers of refugees
and Amerasians who arrived, and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during the preceding three
fiscal years: 1991, 1992, and 1993, based on final arrival data by State. Therefore, estimates have been developed
of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrival or resettlement dates between October 1, 1990, and September
30, 1993, who are thought to be living in each State as of October 1, 1993. Refugees admitted under the Federal Government's
private-sector initiative are not included, since their assistance and services are to be provided by the private
sponsoring organizations under an agreement with the Department of State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimates of secondary migration were based on data submitted by all participating States on Form ORR&hyph;11.
The total migration reported by each State was summed, yielding in- and out-migration figures and a net migration
figure for each State. The net migration figure was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revised
population estimate. Because the reporting period covered on Form ORR&hyph;11 was a maximum of only 8 months as of
June 1993 for the majority of States whose reporting base was their cash/medical assistance caseload, extra weight
was given to the secondary migration reported by those States to arrive at estimates of secondary migration over a
36-month period. In 1993, no count of recently-arrived refugee children was available from the Department of Education
for use as a comparison. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and then combined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant
population for each State. Eligible Amerasians are included in the refugee figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year populations, as of October 1, 1993, of refugees (col. 1), entrants (col.
2), and total refugees and entrants (col. 3); the formula amounts which the population estimates yield (col. 4); and
the allocation amounts after allowing for the minimum amounts (col. 5). Table 1 also shows the number of former political
prisoner arrivals in FY 1993 (col. 6); and the allocation amounts for services to this population (col. 7).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in National Coalition for the Homeless v. Veterans Administration,
No. 88&hyph;2503&hyph;OG (D.D.C.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A&hyph;10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443&hyph;2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1&hyph;800&hyph;927&hyph;7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Barbara
Richards at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the landholding agency, and the property number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces a change in the maximum interest rate for mortgages to be insured under section 235(r) of the
National Housing Act. The section 235(r) maximum interest rate is to be determined by the Secretary of HUD and published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Mortgage market conditions now dictate that the Secretary increase the section 235(r) maximum rate from 8.00 percent
to 8.50 percent. There is no change being made in the maximum margin of additional percentage points that may be added
to the maximum rate if the established conditions are met. Therefore, the maximum for the premium section 235(r) interest
rate will be 10.00 percent (8.50 percent for the rate of interest and 1.50 percent for the margin of additional percentage
points).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 235(r) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z) authorizes the Secretary to insure mortgages that refinance
existing mortgages insured under section 235. The purpose of the program is to reduce the interest rate insured and
assisted under section 235 in order that the assistance payments the Department pays on behalf of mortgagors may be
reduced. The regulations implementing the program are contained in subpart H of 24 CFR part 235_refinancing of mortgages
under section 235(r). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interest rate for these loans is set by the Secretary and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as authorized by 24 CFR 235.1202(b)(3). The previous section 235(r) interest rate of 8.00 percent was published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19021). The Department has determined that market conditions dictate a change in the section
235(r) interest rate. The change will take effect on the date of publication of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent HUD survey of Mortgage Market conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., Secondary Market Prices and Yields), an OMB-designated Principal Federal Indicator, found that the dominant
national FHA rate being quoted to potential homebuyers for ``lock-in'' commitments of 60 days or more was 8.50 percent
on April 1, 1994, with an average of .32 points, and an effective interest rate of 8.55 percent. The 8.50 percent rate
was dominant in most parts of the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most FHA mortgages are funded in the GNMA mortgage-backed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
securities market. There is a 50 basis point spread between FHA contract interest rates and GNMA coupon rates (this
covers the GNMA guarantee fee and servicing cost). On May 12, 1994, the GNMA 7.50 percent coupon securities (8.00 percent
FHA loans) were priced at about 5 points discount. This level of discount tends to impede FHA loans to finance home purchases.
On the other hand, the GNMA 8.00 percent security (8.50 percent FHA loans) was trading in the two-month forward market
at around two points discount, while the 8.50 percent GNMA coupons (9.00 percent FHA mortgages) continued to trade
at over par (i.e., premium). Under the FHA negotiated rate/points provisions a two point discount for 8.50 percent
FHA mortgages would not be burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that secondary market prices will stabilize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the near term at the 8.50 percent contract rate. The May 1, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Blue Chip Financial Forecast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 showed that after mortgage rates rose in the first quarter of 1994, the average forecast was that mortgage rates would
stabilize in the second, third and fourth quarters. The May summary forecast of Data Resources Incorporated projects
a rise in 30 year Treasury rates during the second quarter (which is half over), then stable rates in the third and fourth
quarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjusting the section 235(r) rate to 8.50 percent will bring this rate back into line with the rest of the FHA current
production loans. Therefore, the maximum rate for section 235(r) mortgages is 8.50 percent beginning with the publication
date of this notice. The maximum margin of additional percentage points that may be added to the maximum rate under
24 CFR 235.1202(b)(3)(i)(B) will remain at 1.50 percent.

At 8:30 a.m. on July 24, 1994, the lands will be opened to location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject
to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, and other segregations of record. Appropriation
of any of the lands described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is
unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988),
shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession
are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in
disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local
courts.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mr. Welton Tapper, the owner of a single family lot in the Country Cove subdivision, (Applicant) is seeking an incidental
take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species
Act (Act). The proposed permit would authorize the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
incidental to construction of a single family residence on an approximately 0.5 acre lot within the subdivision.
The lot is located in the Country Cove subdivision, in the Town of Malabar, Brevard County, Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. The Service is soliciting data on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aphelocoma coerulescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 coerulescens in order to assist in the requirement of the intra-Service consultation. This notice also advises the
public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major
Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C)
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is based on information
contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice.
This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40
CFR 1506.6).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
 Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
Florida scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total
estimated population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the
State of Florida, it has been estimated that the Florida scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the
last 100 years. Surveys have indicated that suitable Florida scrub jay habitat exists on the Applicant's property
and surrounding areas. Construction of this individual homesite may therefore result in death of, or injury to, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property
development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EA considers the environmental consequences of two alternatives. The no action alternative may result in some
loss of habitat for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and exposure of the Applicant under Section 9 of the Act. This action is inconsistent with the purposes and intent of
Section 10 of the Act. The proposed action alternative is issuance of the incidental take permit. This provides for
restrictions of construction activity, monitoring Florida scrub jay activity during construction of the home,
retaining natural vegetation to the maximum extent practicable, enhancing native vegetation through replanting,
a prohibition on pets, and installation of a bird feeder and bird bath on the property. The HCP provides a funding mechanism
for these mitigation measures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Richland Bull Creek Associates (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental
take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroica chrysoparia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed take would occur as a result of construction of a residential development on 196 acres, in Austin, Travis
County, Texas. The proposed development will permanently eliminate about 176 acres of occupied and/or potential
endangered species habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the incidental
take application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not
be made before 30 days from the date of the publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A Habitat Conservation Plan has been developed as mitigation for the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler.
The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 260 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler
habitat as a permanent preserve, providing funding for the operation and management of the preserve lands, performing
golden-cheeked warbler monitoring and research studies on the preserve and project lands, and avoiding construction
activities within warbler territories during the breeding season. Details of the mitigation are provided in the
Environmental Assessment and Habitat Conservation Plan for the Spicewood at Bull Creek and Canyon Mesa Developments.
A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days
from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National
Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). The Applicant considered four alternatives, but rejected
three of them.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency by the grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings
will consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would allow material licensees who have an approved decommissioning plan to semiannually request
the NRC to reduce the amount of their decommissioning financial assurance requirement amount as decommissioning
proceeds and contamination is reduced at the site. This semiannual licensee request would then be evaluated by the
NRC before granting a licensee a reduction in the amount of funds required for financial assurance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;58 issued to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne
Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, and Toledo Edison Company (the licensees) for operation
of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1, located in Lake County, Ohio.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed action would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications (TS) to delete the area critically
monitors for the fuel preparation pool, spent fuel storage pool and the upper containment pools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated February 28, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment is needed to reflect that area criticality monitors for the fuel preparation pool, spent fuel
storage pool and the upper containment pools are monitors only and do not prevent inadvertent criticality and are
not considered in any design basis accident or transient. Therefore, these monitors can be adequately controlled
by plant documents and procedures similar to other area radiation monitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and concludes that removing the area criticality
monitors from TS and placing operability and surveillance requirements in plant documents and procedures will not
increase offsite releases. These monitors are not relied upon to successfully mitigate a fuel handling accident
outside of containment. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents,
no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase
in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the NRC staff concludes
that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes to the TS involve systems located within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Commission's staff has concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action, any alternatives would have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater
environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not reduce environmental impacts
as a result of plant operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
related to operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the State of Ohio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for amendment dated February 28,
1992, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street,

Pursuant to delegated authority, the Division of Market Regulation issued the following letter granting class exemptions
(``Exemptions'') from rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7, and 10b&hyph;8 (``Trading Practices Rules'') under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate distributions in the United States of securities of certain highly capitalized
French issuers. The Exemptions permit distribution participants and their affiliated purchases to effect transactions
in France that otherwise would be prohibited by the Trading Practices Rules, subject to certain disclosure, recordkeeping,
record production, and notice requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exemptions have been issued in the context of a continuing review of the Trading Practices Rules, and are published
to provide notice of their availability.

I. Offerings By French Companies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The structure of an offering of equity securities in a French company varies depending on whether it is a primary or
a secondary offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Primary Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
French law grants shareholders of a French company pre-emptive rights to subscribe for shares issued by such company.
French law also authorizes shareholders, voting at a shareholders meeting, to renounce such pre-emptive rights.
In practice, in the case of a renunciation of such pre-emptive rights, most offerings are conducted so as to grant current
shareholders a priority right to purchase new shares before the general public during a period of 5 to 10 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Offerings With Pre-emptive Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Offerings with pre-emptive rights permit the current shareholders to participate in the capital increase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or to sell their pre-emptive rights, which are securities separable from the shares, on the market. The existence
of a negotiable pre-emptive right permits detachment of the offering price from the stock market price, because the
shareholders who do not want to participate in an offering can, by selling their rights on the market, be compensated
for the dilution which could result from an offering price which is significantly less than the market price and/or
than their share in the net assets. The discount from the stock market price is generally 10% to 20%. The technique of
an offering with pre-emptive rights is principally used for offerings of shares rather than for those of ``composite
securities'', such as bonds with warrants or bonds convertible into shares, for reasons of valuation and quotation
on the appropriate stock market.

2. Offerings Without Pre-emptive Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
French law permits an issuer, when it is authorized by its shareholders, to issue shares (or securities exchangeable
for, or convertible into, shares) without pre-emptive rights. In this case, the law limits the discount at which the
issuer may offer the shares from the stock market price.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The issue price must be at least equal to the average of the stock market prices for any 20 consecutive business days
during the 40-day period immediately preceding the date of the offering (the ``20/40 rule''). The 20/40 rule protects
shareholders to the extent that it limits the discount that can be set for an offering of shares without pre-emptive
rights. In addition, the COB has recommended a priority period in the case of an offering without pre-emptive rights,
permitting current shareholders to subscribe for new shares on a priority basis. This period provides existing shareholders
the ability to maintain their shareholding in the capital of a company of which they are shareholders, even if they
have waived their pre-emptive rights. The practice of the priority period has been widely followed for offerings
without pre-emptive rights; offerings without a priority period are rare today in France (1 or 2 per year).

Article 186&hyph;1, second paragraph of the law of July 24, 1966 on commercial companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 20/40 rule applies, according to the text of the law, only to straight share offerings; however, to avoid circumvention
of the law, the COB requires that the 20/40 rule be applied in the case of offerings of convertible bonds or warrants.
In applying the 20/40 rule, issuers generally choose a reference period that is close to the offering date in order
to limit the amount of the discount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate an underwritten offering in France and/or on the international market at the same time as an
offering with a priority period, the COB has accepted that the priority period only apply to a substantial part (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., at least two thirds) of the offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Offerings Without a Priority Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Offerings without a priority period are extremely rare. Such offerings are used under very limited circumstances,
such as when an issuer needs to offer shares publicly on a foreign market. Such an offering can only take place if one
or both of the following two conditions are met:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
_It must be at the closest possible price to the stock market price; and/or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The existing shareholders are compensated, for example in the form of a distribution of free shares or warrants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Offerings without a priority period will probably remain atypical, because shareholders generally want to avoid
dilution through the use of pre-emptive rights or a priority period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Underwritten Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the case of offerings with a priority period, an underwritten offering can occur during the period when the existing
shareholders have a priority right to subscribe for new shares, by anticipating that a fraction of the existing shareholders
will not subscribe for new shares. Underwritten offerings in France and/or on the international market can therefore
take place during the priority period granted to existing shareholders without extending the offering period. In
order to accommodate the differences between the actual behavior of the existing shareholders and the level of anticipated
purchases, several techniques are used: ``claw-back'' arrangements, over-allotment options and arrangements
whereby a majority shareholder renounces his priority subscription rights.

B. Secondary Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Public Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public offerings are the traditional means of selling a large number of shares of a listed company on the market. Public
offerings are regulated both by the general rules of the CBV (title 7) and by the rules of the COB 89.03, chapter III.
Public offerings are at a price different from the market price. sellers, however, generally offer the shares at a
price which is close to the market. price Privatizations, which are a particular kind of public offerings, because
of the nature of the seller (the State) and of the volume of capital involved (up to several dozen billion francs per
transaction), can be carried out with a substantial discount from the last quoted market price (e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 10 to 15%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public offerings require the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_approval of the CBV;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_the clearance of the prospectus by the COB;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The centralization of subscription orders by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bourses Fran&ccedil;aises;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, public tender offers are market transactions which require a high level of disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a public offering, all financial institutions, such as banks (but also other financial intermediaries such as
the French National Post Office and brokerage houses), can receive orders from the public. Such orders are transmitted
to the SBF where they are centralized. None of the financial institutions has any influence over the allocation of
the shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public offering may be underwritten on a stand-by basis. Historically, most public offerings, and in particular
those relating to privatizations, are oversubscribed (about 2 to 4 times).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Underwritten Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever an offering is sufficiently large, an underwritten offering can take place in France and/or on an international
market. This is particularly the case in the context of privatization transactions. Such transactions, which use
the book-billing method, provide the banks leading the syndicate greater flexibility when allocating shares to
investors. In the context of an underwritten offering, the price for the offering is set based upon indications of
interest received from potential investors; however, the final price determined by the lead managers cannot be less
than the price in the public tender offer. During the first privatization which used this technique (Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc,
November 1993), the institutional investors who purchased shares in the underwritten offering paid a price 8% higher
than that paid by individuals who purchased shares in the public offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Bought Deals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``bought deal'' permits the placement of a certain amount (usually large) of securities with certain institutional
investors. This type of offering, different from a public offering, can only occur when it involves shares of a listed
company being offered at the market price or by techniques explicitly provided for in the general rules of the CBV:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_By ``applications'' (title 4, chapter III of the general rules of the CBV), the price in this case must be between the
best purchase offer and the best sale offer existing at the time of the application (article 4&hyph;7&hyph;3);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_By option contracts (title 7, chapter II of the general rules of the CBV): these contracts permit the sale or purchase
of a given amount of securities at a price quoted on a stock market the day of the contract or the day of its term or at the
average of the quoted prices between those two dates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The seller of securities places the securities through a bank or banks with institutional investors of such seller's
choice. Accordingly, the seller transfers the securities first to the bank or banks which have committed to sell them
to such institutional investors in France or abroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COB carefully reviews this type of placement in order to ensure that it is not used to advantage unfairly any existing
shareholder of the company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Market Activities of Underwriters During Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In France, the banks are the underwriters of securities. The vast majority of French banks provide a full range of banking
and securities services such as brokerage, underwriting and investment advisory services including managing on
a discretionary basis the portfolios of bank customers. However, banks may not be direct members of the Paris Bourse
and have to set up separate subsidiaries which will be members of the Bourse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The French banks acting as underwriters typically continue to engage in a range of trading activities during a distribution.
The underwriters may be active in trading all kinds of securities of the issuer or derivative instruments related
to such securities both in the cash market and in the options market. In these markets, the underwriters trade securities
in the ordinary course for their own account. In addition, the underwriters continue to make investment decisions
for the accounts they manage and their mutual fund management company affiliates continue to make investment decisions
on behalf of the mutual funds they manage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements to which they are subject and pursuant to their own respective
internal policies and conduct of business rules, banks maintain ``Chinese wall'' procedures to separate certain
divisions within their respective organizations. The main purpose of these Chinese walls is to ensure that confidential
information held within parts of the respective companies or divisions does not spread inadvertently to other parts
of those companies or to affiliated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under French law, companies are prohibited from purchasing their own shares either directly or through
a financial intermediary acting on behalf of the company except in limited circumstances. These circumstances are
set forth in article 217&hyph;1 and 217&hyph;2 of the Companies Act of July 24, 1966, and in COB Regulations No. 90.04.
They include purchases made for the purpose of offering shares to employees of the corporation and, for listed companies,
purchases made for the purpose of market stabilization. These purchases are limited to 10% of the share capital of
the corporation. The company may not own more than 10% of any class of its outstanding shares in capital at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under COB Regulation No 90.04, such purchases may be only to ensure the liquidity of the shares or to control excessive
fluctuations in their price. The company is required to file a copy of the shareholder's resolution authorizing such
transactions with the COB prior to engaging in such transactions, as well as a monthly copy of the register of purchases
and sales thereafter.

Under article 9 of COB Regulation No. 90.04, transactions made by a company in its own shares and, during a distribution
period, transactions made by financial intermediaries for their own account or on behalf of the underwriting syndicate,
for the purpose of ensuring the proper execution of the distribution are presumed to be legitimate when complying
with the following requirements: (i) the transactions are performed contrary to the trend of the last quoted price,
(ii) the transactions represent a maximum volume of 25% of the total daily transactions recorded over a reference
period

A. The Equity Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Securities may be listed on one of France's seven stock exchanges: Paris, Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nancy
and Nantes which together constitute a single exchange system headed by the same authorities and subject to the same
listing requirements. All securities are traded through a single electronic system, CAC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Trading on the Paris Bourse
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trading on the Paris Bourse begins at 10 a.m. and ends at 5 p.m. (Paris time) each business day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities may be traded on the cash market (march&eacute; au comptant) or on the monthly settlement market (r&egrave;glement
mensuel RM). Cash transactions comprise the least actively traded French and foreign equity securities on the official
list, all debt securities on the official list and all equity stocks on the second market and hors cote.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most actively traded French and foreign equity securities on the official list are traded on a monthly settlement
basis. All the securities comprising the CAC 40 Index are traded on the monthly settlement market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities on the monthly settlement market are traded in round lots of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100, set by the Paris Bourse
to reflect their limit price. While transactions are firm both in prices and quantity once they have been concluded,
the actual cash settlement and delivery of the shares do not take place until the end of the trading month. Investors
on the monthly settlement market must meet an initial margin requirement which may be adjusted as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When investors place orders on the monthly settlement market they may request immediate settlement provided that
they have the related cash (for a purchase) or securities (for a sale). Trades on odd lots are settled immediately.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trading in France takes place on a centralized order driven market through member firms, authorized by the Conseil
des Bourses de Valeurs, acting as brokers. Transactions are handled by CAC, an electronic trading system, through
terminals installed in member firms' premises and linked to the Paris Bourse central computers. The core of the CAC
system is linked upstream to an order routing system and downstream to a computerised system that disseminates key
markets data in real time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Orders entered in the CAC system by the Bourse member firms acting either on their own behalf or as agents for their clients,
are automatically ranked by price limit and, within each limit, are queued to reflect the order of entry in the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. the market is in its pre-opening phase and orders are entered into the centralized order book,
without any transaction taking place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At 10 a.m., the market opens. Based on the limit orders received, the central computer calculates the opening price
at which the largest number of bids and asks orders can be matched. At the same time, the system transforms orders at
market price into limit orders at the opening price, with the result that all limit buy orders at higher prices and limit
sell orders at lower prices are executed. Limit orders at the opening price are executed to the extent that match orders
are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., trading takes place on a continuous basis. The execution price is the price limit placed on the
matching order. Where price limits are identical, orders are executed on a first entered, first matched basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAC automatically feeds information into the system's electronic data dissemination network. As a result, at any
given time, the CAC displays the five best bids and asks (price and volume) as well as, in real time, the five latest transactions
completed (time price, number of shares traded).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
French securities brokers may also act as principals with respect to clients on the Paris Bourse. However, such prices
must be lodged on to the CAC and must be at or within the current market spread at the time of their transmission. After
hours principal transactions may also take place at any price within the spread at the previous close, plus or minus
1%. Those transactions must be reported to the SBF prior to the opening of the next trading session. Every morning,
prior to the opening, the SBF disseminates through the market data feed message zone the name of the stocks on which
after hours transactions have been reported and the number of shares traded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally block trades in specific securities are permitted outside the market spread, subject to certain restrictions
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the securities broker effecting the trade must agree to fill all buy orders whose price is higher and all sell orders
whose price is lower than such block trade).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Enforcement Division of the SBF is in charge of seeing that member firms of the Paris Bourse comply with the securities
laws and the regulations of the CBV.

B. The MONEP (The Options Market)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MONEP (Paris Traded Options Market) is located within the Paris Bourse; it is governed and regulated by the Conseil
des Bourses de Valeurs, through its general regulation. There are 21 market markers in options on the shares on the
MONEP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market makers are registered with a professional body, the ``Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Compensation des March&eacute;s
Conditionnels'' (SCMC) which is affiliated with the SBF and to which the SBF has delegated responsibility for (i)
options market administration, (ii) technical clearing of the MONEP, (iii) surveillance and control of operations
and members. MONEP members can operate on the markets as brokers and/or as market makers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty seven series of equity options and two series of options based on the CAC 40 index are traded on the floor of the
Paris Bourse, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., on a continuous basis by open outcry around different pits., two to four classes
of options being listed and traded in each pit. In each pit, several SCMC representatives execute orders from the Public
Order Book and are responsible for seeing that traders comply with the market's rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for retail orders, brokerage firms have a direct access to an automated trading system called STAMP (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Syst&egrave;me de Transactions Automaiis&eacute;es du MONEP
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) through terminals in their own trading rooms. Orders are keyed into the centralized public order book and the data
are displayed and disseminated to users. Such orders are either matched automatically inside the book when they represent
the market's best price or routed to SCMC staff for priority execution on the floor if better prices are available there.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MONEP member firms operate through representatives acting in two distinct capacities: (i) As brokers who trade orders
received directly from clients or issued for brokerage houses' own account, (ii) as market makers. Since a modification
of the General Regulation of the CBV that took place in August 1993, there are three types of market makers:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The market makers ``specialist'': a specialist market maker is designated for each class of option. He is the only
market maker responsible for quoting and continuously updating a bid/ask price for the series of option allocated
to the firm. The bid/ask price offered by the specialist is disseminated by the SCMC on quotation screens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The market maker ``counterpart to the market'': he is required to be present on the floor and may trade within the bid/ask
price offered by the specialist. There are various counterparts to the market for the same class of option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The market maker acting as ``block transaction counterpart''. His activity consists in arranging options blocks
transactions for institutional clients, typically from the firm's trading room. The transaction is then executed
on the market if the price is within the spread displayed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This change is being implemented gradually on a class of option by class of option basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Market makers are required to be present on the floor during trading hours and to quote a bid/ask price to any broker
or to the SCMC upon requests. Market makers quotation (bid/ask prices) are entered and disseminated on a real time
basis. All trades are immediately time-stamped and entered into the market system in order to be displayed on the floor
and disseminated outside the floor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After hours trading is forbidden.

C. The Regulatory Authorities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A professional body, the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) (Stock Exchange Council) is the market regulatory body.
The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs promulgates regulation dealing with the operation of the French stock exchanges
and set forth the conditions for authorization of member firms, for admission and withdrawal from listing, and for
take over bids. The CBV rules also set forth a professional code of conduct for Bourse members, their subsidiaries,
their manager and their staff. In addition, the Council can take disciplinary action as necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another professional body, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bourses Fran&ccedil;aises, implements the CBV regulations,
monitors the trading system, disseminates data on market conditions, provides a number of listing and issuing services
and acts as a clearing house between member firms. The SBF handles day to day administration, surveillance, and development
of the market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission des op&eacute;rations de bourse (COB), an independent administrative body, is responsible for overall
supervision of French securities, options and futures markets. Under the Ordinance of September 28, 1967, setting
up the COB, the COB is responsible for seeing to the protection of savings invested in securities and all other investments
involving a public offering, to the provision of information to investors and to the proper functioning of markets
for securities, listed financial products or negotiable futures contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the SBF primarily regulates and carries out the surveillance of the market, including by controlling quotation
rules, participant's risks or margin calls, the market surveillance carried out by the COB is of a different nature
because the COB is entrusted with the broad mission of protecting investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market surveillance carried out by the COB aims at (i) detecting abnormal situations in the functioning of the
markets (ii) sorting and treating data that enable the COB to check that its rules are complied with, including those
relating to public offers and information of shareholders (iii) detecting securities and futures frauds as well
as violations to the business codes of conduct and to regulations of the CBV and the Conseil des March&eacute;s &agrave;
Terme (Futures Market Council).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The surveillance department of the Enforcement Division of the COB is connected to the various computers of the Paris
Bourse, among which the CAC, TOPVAL and REUTER workstations providing the COB with data on a real time basis. Moreover,
the COB has set up its own data base directly linked to the Paris Bourse, the MONEP and the MATIF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 14, 1989, the Commission des op&eacute;rations de bourse and the Securities and Exchange Commission
entered into an administrative agreement on cooperation and exchange of information. This Administrative Agreement
entered into force on January 31, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this Agreement, the COB and the SEC may exchange transaction information, including the identity of customers,
where necessary, in the course of an investigation initiated by either of the Commissions.

D. Laws and Regulations Governing Fraudulent and Manipulative Practices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions relating to fraudulent and manipulative practices are set forth mainly in the Ordinance of September
28, 1967, and in COB Regulation No. 90.04 and No. 90.08.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Article 10.1 of the Ordinance of September 1967 makes it a criminal offense for any persons who have access to privileged
information on an issuer of securities or on the futures prospects of a security or a negotiable future contract to
effect transactions on the market, either directly or through a third party, before the general public was aware of
this information. It would also be a criminal offense for such a person to communicate such information to a third party
outside the normal course of his professional activities. Under article 10.1, criminal sanctions shall also apply
to any persons who have knowingly disseminated to the public, through whatever channels or means, false or deceitful
information on an issuer of securities or on the future prospects of a security, a quoted financial product or a negotiable
futures contract of such nature as to influence prices. Under article 10.3, similar penalties shall apply to any person
who, either directly or indirectly, has knowingly carried out or attempted to carry out a purpose-fully misleading
act on a financial market with the aim of impeding the normal functioning of the market. It should be stressed that under
article 40 of the Criminal Proceeding Code, any governmental entity who becomes aware of a fact that may constitute
a criminal offense has to transmit the information to the Public Prosecutor.

It could, however, be considered more generally that all regulations taken by the COB aim at preventing fraudulent
practices and ensuring investors protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The violation of COB Regulation No. 90.08 relating to the use of privileged information is sanctioned by the COB through
an administrative proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COB Regulation No. 90.04 provides that price setting on the market shall result from the general matching of bids and
offers in compliance with the Regulation of the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs or the Counseil du March&eacute; &agrave;
Terme. Orders transmitted on the market shall not be aimed at hindering or misleading the setting of prices on the market.
If the COB so requires in the course of an investigation, any person transmitting orders on the market must be able to
publicly explain the reasons for, and the details of, the orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation 2.3.11 of the CBV requires the member firms to maintain records of securities transaction effected by
them. Such records must be maintained for at least five years from the date thereof. To ensure that the market's rules
and business code of conduct are complied with by all participants, member firms must specify, when entering orders
into the system, whether these orders come from customers or are being executed for the firm's own account, and whether
such orders are the result of program trading. The required transaction information includes (i) the name of the security
that is the subject of the transaction, (ii) the date of the transaction, (iii) the price and size of the transaction,
(iv) whether the transaction was effected for a customer or a proprietary account, (v) the market on which the transaction
is effected, (vi) whether the transaction was a purchase or a sale and (vii) the identity of the account on whose behalf
the transaction was effected.

A. Reasons for Relief
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application of rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 to the activities of distribution participants
and their affiliates outside the United States, as experienced on the occasion of several public offerings in the
past few years,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 often conflicts with market practices in France and impose compliance burdens and costs on French issuers and underwriters
and their affiliated purchasers. The application of rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 outside the United
States has and would have, inter alia, the following consequences, which jeopardize the success of primary or secondary
offering.

1. Distribution participants, including the underwriters and in particular the lead underwriter would be unable
to maintain an orderly market by buying and selling affected securities as principles during the offering, within
the limits set forth in COB Regulations. Moreover, the affiliates of the distribution participants would be precluded
from fulfilling their formal market-making obligations on the MONEP with respect to listed options that are affected
securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The underwriters might not be able to continue certain of their regular contacts with customers such as discussions
regarding investment strategies with respect to the rights and shares and might not be permitted to buy and sell affected
securities in connection with their customers' trading activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Distribution participants' risk management activities would be restricted. They would be precluded by rule 10b&hyph;6
from hedging in derivatives or other affected securities.

(1) For purposes of this exemption a two business day cooling-off period shall apply under rule 10b&hyph;6(a)(4)(v),
(xi) and (xii) in the United States and in each Significant Market,
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 provided that trading in Relevant Securities in any Significant Market shall be subject to the exemptive relief then
available in such markets, if any or the record maintenance and record production requirements contained in the letter
regarding Application of cooling-off Periods under rule 10b&hyph;6 to Distributions of foreign securities (April

A ``Significant Market'' shall mean (i) (aa) SEAQ International or (bb) any other dealer market outside France and
the United States for which price and volume information is published by an FFRA or (ii) any other securities markets
in a single country other than France or the United States to which a French Issuer has applied for listing the relevant
Qualified French Security and been accepted, if during the Reference Period the volume in either (i) (aa) or (bb) or
(ii) in such relevant Qualified French Security, as published by the relevant FRRA(s), in such securities markets
(as the case may be), is 10% or more of the aggregate worldwide trading volume in that security published by all FFRAs
in (i) and (ii), FFRAs in France, and US securities markets to which such French Issuer has applied for listing such
relevant Qualified French Security and been accepted, during the Reference Period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The lead underwriter or the global coordinator shall promptly, but in any event before the commencement of the
Covered Period, provide a written notice (``Notice'') to the Division of the following information: (i) the name
of the issuer and the Qualified French Securities; (ii) whether the Qualified French Security is a CAC 40 component
security or information with respect to the market capitalization and the average daily trading volume of the Qualified
French Securities to be distributed; (iii) the identity of the Significant Markets where the Qualified French Security
trades; (iv) if the Notice is for more than one entity, the identity of all underwriters and selling group members relying
on these exemptions; and (v) a statement that the Relevant Parties are aware of the terms and conditions of these exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe this proposed exemption would make it possible to maintain liquidity for shares of French companies throughout
a public offering or private placement in the United States, while minimizing the risk of abuses of the kind at which
rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 are aimed.

Thank you for your assistance and the assistance of your staff in this matter.

Exhibit A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The French underwriters (and their affiliates) will, and the other Underwriters (and their affiliates) may, continue
to engage in the transactions and other activities described below, in France and elsewhere outside the United States,
in respect of the securities being distributed, securities of the same class and series as the securities being distributed,
and securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or giving a right to acquire, the foregoing securities, and derivatives
thereof (collectively, the ``Relevant Securities''), during the distribution period, in accordance with exemptions
obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') from the application outside the United
States of rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such exemptions
are subject to certain exceptions, limitations and conditions set out in the Commission's exemption, including
compliance with French law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The activities referred to above are (a) buying and selling Relevant Securities for the accounts of such Underwriters
(or their affiliates), whether for purposes of risk management in connection with the offering, arbitrage or otherwise,
(b) buying and selling Relevant Securities on behalf of customers, (c) advising customers as to the purchase or sale
of Relevant Securities, including publication of specific company and industry research reports, (d) engaging
in securities lending transactions in Relevant Securities and (e) stabilizing the market (as described below).
As a result of these activities, the Underwriters may at any time be short or long in Relevant Securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is general market practice in France for the Underwriters, and the lead Underwriter in particular, to maintain
an orderly market in subscription rights and existing shares, and it is expected that the lead Underwriter will take
measures to avoid extreme price fluctuations during the distribution period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The activities referred to above may result in the market prices of the Relevant Securities being different from those
that might otherwise have prevailed in the open market if rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 had applied
in France and elsewhere outside the United States.

A. All transactions in Relevant Securities in a ``Significant Market,'' as defined below, shall be effected in accordance
with the requirements of rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7, and 10b&hyph;8, except as permitted by paragraph IV.B. below
or by other available exemptions. For purposes of these exemptions, ``Significant Market'' means: (i) SEAQ International
or any other dealer market outside the United States and France for which price and volume information is published
by an FFRA; or (ii) any other securities market(s) in a single country other than the United States or France to which
a French Issuer has applied for listing the Qualified French Security and been accepted, if during the Reference Period
the volume in either (i) or (ii) in such Qualified French Security, as published by the relevant FFRA(s) in such securities
market, is 10 percent or more of the aggregate worldwide trading volume in that security published by all FFRAs in (i)
and (ii), FFRAs in France, and U.S. securities markets to which such French Issuer has applied for listing such Qualified
French Security and been accepted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. In the case of a distribution of Qualified French Securities made pursuant to rights (``rights distribution''),
the Relevant Parties located in the United Kingdom (``U.K. Relevant Parties''): (a) in connection with the rights
distribution, may purchase or solicit the purchase of Relevant Securities in transactions solely in response to
orders for the accounts of their customers in the ordinary course of their business in the United Kingdom (``customer
facilitation activities''); and (b) may bid for or purchase Relevant Securities as principal in market making transactions
through SEAQ International during the rights distribution, in each case subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. During the period from five business days prior to the expiration date of the rights distribution and until the expiration
date, inclusive, at any time at which the difference between the rights exercise price and the market price of the security
underlying the rights (which for this purpose will be taken to mean the mid-price between the highest bid and lowest
offer quoted on SEAQ International for the security underlying the rights) does not represent a discount of at least
10 percent from the then current market price of the security underlying the rights, the U.K. Relevant Parties will
effect ``passive market making'' transactions in the Relevant Securities subject to the terms and conditions of

2. The U.K. Relevant Parties, in accordance with Item 502(d)(1) of Regulation S&hyph;K under the Securities Act,
shall include a statement regarding transactions which stabilize or maintain the market price of the Relevant Securities
with appropriate modification, to reflect the possibility that the U.K. Relevant Parties may engage in market making,
including passive market making, and customer facilitation activities that otherwise would be prohibited by rule
10b&hyph;6, and shall include pursuant to rule 408 under the Securities Act in the ``Plan of Distribution'' or similar
section of the prospectus, a brief description of such proposed market making and customer facilitation activities
in the Relevant Securities; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The recordkeeping and production requirements set forth by the Commission in the LSE Letter shall apply to all transactions
effected by or on behalf of the U.K. Relevant Parties' accounts, or for the accounts of customers in connection with
customer facilitation activities during the rights distribution.

In Amendment No. 1, the Amex amended its proposal to provide that: (1) The exercise settlement value for all of the Nikkei
Stock Index 300 expiring option contracts will be the special opening quotation, which is calculated based upon the
opening prices of each of the component securities on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on the last business day prior to expiration;
(2) the position and exercise limits for Nikkei Stock Index 300 option contracts in the series with the nearest expiration
month will be 30,000 contracts; (3) the trading unit for Nikkei Stock Index 300 options is the Index value multiplied
by $100; (4) for valuation purposes, one Nikkei Stock Index 300 unit (1.0) is assigned a fixed value of one U.S. dollar;
and (5) the Tokyo Stock Exchange has recently requested that a new comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement
be entered into for options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300, which agreement will cover the sharing of surveillance information
regarding the index's component securities. See Letter from Claire P. McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel
for Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market
Regulation, Commission, dated June 10, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange is proposing to trade standardized options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Index''). In addition, the
Amex proposes to amend Amex Rule 904C(b) to provide for a position limit for the Index of 50,000 contracts on the same
side of the market, provided that no more than 30,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange is proposing to trade standardized options on the Index. The Index is comprised of 30 stocks which are
representative of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE'').

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index was designed and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``Nihon''). The Index's component securities
were selected for their high market capitalizations and high degree of liquidity, and are representative of the relative
distribution of industries within the broader Japanese equity market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The median capitalization of the companies in the Index on March 31, 1994, was 340.1 billion yen (US $3.3 billion at
the exchange rate of 102.75 yen per dollar prevailing on March 31, 1994). The average market capitalization of these
companies was US $7.5 billion on the same date and using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalizations
of these companies ranged from a low of US $875 million to a high of US $76.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock
accounted for 3.41 percent of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index is a capitalization-weighted index and is calculated by multiplying the price of each component security
(in Japanese yen) by its number of shares outstanding, adding those sums and dividing by the current Index divisor.
The Index divisor was determined initially to yield a benchmark value of 100 on October 1, 1982. The Index's closing
value on April 13, 1994, was 296.35. The Index multiplier is 100, and, for valuation purposes, one Index unit (1.0)
is assigned a fixed value of one U.S. dollar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be maintained by Nihon. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect
certain events relating to the component securities. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the
number of shares outstanding, spinoffs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The composition
of the Index will be reviewed periodically by Nihon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed options on the Index are to be European-style (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, exercises are permitted at expiration only), and cash-settled. Trading hours for the Index options will be 9 a.m.
to 4:15 p.m. (New York time). Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration
month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series normally will be the business day immediately
preceding Expiration Friday of each expiration month (normally a Thursday) and trading in expiring options will
cease at the close of trading on such day. The exercise settlement value for all of the Index's expiring options will
be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the special opening quotation, which is calculated based upon the opening price of each of the component securities
on the TSE on the last business day prior to expiration. If a stock fails to open for trading, the last available price
of the stock will be used to calculate the Index's settlement value. When an option expiration is moved in accordance
with an Exchange holiday, the last trading day for the expiring Index options will be Wednesday, and the exercise settlement
value of the Index options will be determined at the opening of the regular Thursday trading session on the TSE, even
if the TSE is open on Friday. If the TSE will be closed on the Friday before expiration but the Amex is not, the last trading
day for expiring Index options will be on Wednesday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the three
additional calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer-term options series having up to 36 months to expiration
may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may list long-term, reduced-value
put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) of the Index's full value. The current and closing Index value of any
such reduced-value long-term option will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) after the initial computation.
In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option
will not be less than six months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of standardized and long-term option contracts based on the
Index. These rules cover issues such as sales practices, margin requirements, exercise prices, position and exercise
limits, and floor trading procedures. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's
other index options also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The Exchange represents that the TSE
has requested that a new comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement be executed with respect to options on the
Index. This agreement will cover the sharing of surveillance information regarding the Index's component securities.

The Exchange believes that the Index is a Stock Index Option under Amex Rule 901C(a) and a Broad Stock Index Group under
Amex Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Amex Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within ten points above or below the current index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Amex Rule 904C(b), a position limit of 50,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no more than 30,000
of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In anticipation of substantial customer activity in the options on this Index (including institutional activity),
the Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Exchange believes that the ability to use Auto-Ex
for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with deep, liquid markets, as well as expeditious executions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.

The purpose of the rule filing is to set forth in MSTC's rules the fact that MSTC may provide reorganization notices
by computer facility. The computer facility that MSTC developed for the purpose of providing reorganization notices
is a user-friendly, real-time computer system that allows participants, through the use of intuitive, data-driven
displays, to view offer information on-line. It will allow MSTC participants to inquire as to various offer criteria,
including offer type(s), target CUSIP(s), MSTC offer status, and offer date(s). Participants will be able to tailor
their inquiries to only those offers in which they have a depository position. They may also view the location of a position
within their MSTC account(s) for a chosen CUSIP. In addition, participants will be able to inquire as to a CUSIP's reorganization
history.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4 of Article IV of MSTC's rules describes MSTC's activities with respect to reorganizations, and sections 3 and
4 of Rule 2 of Article IV describe MSTC's responsibilities with respect to reorganization information disseminated
by MSTC. Pursuant to these rules, MSTC currently provides daily notification of newly announced and updated corporate
reorganization offers to its participants through manually produced, hard-copy notices. MSTC produces these notices,
which include pertinent offer information, for a variety of offer types including, but not limited to, mergers, reverse
splits, tenders and exchanges, expiring rights and warrants, put options on corporate and municipal bonds, and expiring
convertible securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each current notice includes a disclaimer to the effect that MSTC does not guarantee the correctness or completeness
of the information provided. This liability standard has been used for over twenty years and was part of MSTC's written
procedures when MSTC applied for and received permanent registration as a clearing agency. The proposed interpretation
sets forth language that limits MSTC's liability with respect to the information provided by computer. The liability
standard is substantially the same as the standard for the hard copy notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act in that it will facilitate the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on June 1, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;08)
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by primarily NSCC. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change modifies NSCC's fee structure as it relates to correction fees for the processing of municipal
securities transactions. The text of the rule change is set forth at Exhibit A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the rule change is to modify NSCC's fee structure as it relates to correction fees for the processing
of municipal securities transactions to reflect the fact that correction capabilities have been accelerated in
conformity with comparison capabilities. In August of 1993, NSCC accelerated the comparison processing for municipal
securities transactions to the date after trade date (``T+1''). Previously NSCC had charged participants for supplemental
input on or after T+2. Because correction processing can now be initiated on T+1, the NSCC fee structure is being modified
in order to charge participants for supplemental input on or after T+1. Although the acceleration of municipal bond
comparison occurred in August of 1993, this fee change will be effective for supplemental comparison processing
as of June 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change provides for the equitable allocation of dues, fees, and charges among participants. Therefore,
NSCC believes that it is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSCC believes that the proposed rule changes will not have any impact or impose a burden on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSCC has neither solicited nor received any written comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and subparagraph (e)(2) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because it establishes a due, fee, or other charge imposed
by NSCC.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 At any time within sixty days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.

APPLICANTS' REPRESENTATIONS: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. The Trust currently offers
shares representing interests in seven investment portfolios (together with future investment portfolios, the
``Funds''); the American AAdvantage Money Market Fund, the American AAdvantage Municipal Money Market Fund; and
the American AAdvantage U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (the ``Money Market Funds''); the American AAdvantage Balanced
Fund (the ``Balanced Fund''); the American AAdvantage Equity Fund (the ``Equity Fund''); the American AAdvantage
International Equity Fund (the ``International Equity Fund''); and the American AAdvantage Limited-Term Income
Fund (the ``Limited-Term Income Fund'' and, collectively with the Balanced Fund, the Equity Fund, and International
Equity Fund, the ``Non-Money Market Funds'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. AMR is the manager of each Fund, the sole investment adviser of the Money Market Funds, and the sole active investment
adviser to the Limited-Term Income Fund. AMR is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR Corporation, the parent company
of American Airlines, Inc. The assets of each of the Non-Money Market Funds, other than the Limited-Term Income Fund,
are allocated by AMR among certain investment advisers designated for each Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to permit the Funds to offer an unlimited number of classes of shares in their
existing and future investment portfolios. These new classes will be offered (a) in connection with a plan adopted
pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act (a ``Distribution Plan''), (b) in connection with a non-rule 12b&hyph;1
shareholder services plan (a ``Shareholder Services Plan''), (c) in connection with the allocation of certain expenses,
as described below, that are directly attributable only to certain classes, and/or (d) without any Distribution
Plan or Shareholder Services Plan. The Distribution Plan and the Shareholder Services Plan are sometimes collectively
referred to as the ``Plans.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Shares of the Funds presently are offered with no front-end sales charge. Pursuant to the terms of the Prior Order,
the Money Market Funds currently offer and sell two classes of shares designated as Mileage Class shares and Institutional
Class shares. Mileage Class shares are presently offered and sold only to natural persons and certain grantor trusts.
Institutional Class shares of the Money Market Funds and shares of the Non-Money Market Funds are presently offered
and sold primarily to institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Shares of each existing Fund are distributed directly by the Trust. In the future, some or all classes of the Funds
may be distributed through one or more principal underwriters. Under the current self-distribution arrangement,
distribution activities are carried out primarily by officers of the Trust. The Mileage Class of each of the Money
Market Funds has adopted a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, which provides that each Mileage Class will pay .25% of its average
daily net assets to AMR as compensation for distribution services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Currently, each shareholder of the Non-Money Market Funds is required to enter into a shareholder services agreement
with AMR (a ``Shareholder Services Agreement''). Under this agreement, AMR provides or oversees on behalf of the
shareholder's account certain administrative and management services (other than investment advisory and portfolio
allocation services) for which each shareholder (and not the Fund) pays an annualized fee directly to AMR. This fee
currently equals 0.30% of a shareholder's assets invested in each Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If applicants' proposed multiple class distribution system (``Multiple Class System'') is approved by the SEC,
and subject to shareholder approval, the Non-Money Market Funds will no longer have Shareholder Services Agreements.
After implementation of the Multiple Class System, the Non-Money Market Funds will have internalized fees as described
below. Certain classes of the Funds, however, may establish an externalized account maintenance fee for low balance
accounts. It is presently expected that any account maintenance fee charged will not exceed an annual fee of approximately
$25. The fee will be a direct charge against the shares held in the account and will be collected by redeeming a sufficient
number of full and/or fractional shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. With respect to each new class of shares created, the Funds could enter into a Distribution Plan agreement and/or
a Shareholder Services Plan agreement with AMR and/or other groups, organizations or institutions (``Organizations'')
concerning the provision of certain services to shareholders of a particular class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Because many of the services contemplated under a Distribution Plan will be distribution related, such Plan will
be adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. A Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject
to rule 12b&hyph;1, although the shares offered in connection with such a Plan need not be accorded the voting rights
specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. Under a Shareholder Services Plan, fees will be paid by a Fund to one or more Organizations
for shareholder services provided with respect to the shares. Organizations may charge other fees directly to class
shareholders who are the beneficial owners of shares in connection with class shareholder accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. With respect to each new class, a Fund could pay an Organization either directly or indirectly pursuant to a Distribution
Plan or Shareholder Services Plan for its services and assistance in accordance with the terms of its particular Plan
agreement (``Plan Payments'') and the expense of such payments will be borne entirely by the beneficial owners of
the class of the Fund to which each Plan agreement relates. Plan Payments paid to an Organization pursuant to a Distribution
Plan agreement currently are not expected to exceed .75% of the average daily net asset value of the shares of the class
subject to that particular Distribution Plan agreement. Similarly, Plan Payments paid to an Organization pursuant
to a Shareholder Services Plan agreement are currently not expected to exceed .30% of the average daily net value of
the shares of the class subject to that particular Shareholder Services Plan agreement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. If any class of a Fund's shares are distributed by a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(``NASD''), with respect to each class of shares such Fund shall comply with Article III, section 26 of the Rules of
Fair Practice of the NASD as it relates to the maximum amount of asset-based sales charges that may be imposed by an investment
company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants anticipate that shares of one new class will be offered to tax-exempt employee benefit and retirement
plans of AMR Corporation and its affiliates (the ``AMR Class''). Other new classes, as well as the existing Institutional
Class and Mileage Class, will be offered to institutional investors (other than such benefit plans) and to natural
persons (the ``Unaffiliated Classes''). The offerees of AMR Class shares, on the one hand, and of the Unaffiliated
Classes, on the other hand, will not overlap. Offerees of the AMR Class shares will consist of tax-exempt employee
benefit and retirement plans of AMR Corporation and its affiliates for the benefit of employees, under which the assets
are held in trust by a trustee and employees have limited pre-retirement access to the assets. Applicants propose
to describe, in a separate prospectus, the expenses, performance data and net asset value of the AMR Class shares only
to investors eligible to purchase AMR Class shares and not to investors eligible to purchase shares of the Unaffiliated
Classes. Only those limited ``inside'' investors described above will be eligible to purchase AMR Class shares.
Persons to whom the Unaffiliated Classes will be offered will be ineligible to purchase AMR Class shares since such
investors do not fall within the scope of AMR Class offerees as defined above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. In addition, because shares of each class will be marketed to different types of investors, the method of soliciting
sales of such shares will vary. A separate prospectus will be used to offer AMR Class shares and will be tailored to the
needs of such investors regarding purchase procedures and cost information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The shares in different classes within a Fund might have different exchange privileges. Any exchange privilege
connected to any of the Funds' shares will be limited to exchanges among Funds that are part of the same ``group of investment
companies,'' as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. All exchanges will be conducted in accordance with the provisions
of rule 11a&hyph;3. In addition, applicants anticipate that shares of each Fund will be exchangeable for shares of
other classes within the same Fund to the extent that the shareholder will have been eligible to purchase the shares
acquired in the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The expenses of the Trust that cannot be attributed directly to any one Fund (``Trust Expenses'') generally will
be allocated to each Fund based on the relative net assets of those Funds. Certain expenses that may be attributable
to a particular Fund, but not a particular class (``Fund Expenses'') will be allocated to each class based on the daily
net assets of the class. Finally, certain expenses may be attributable to a particular class of shares of a Fund (``Class
Expenses''). Class Expenses will be charged directly to the net assets of the particular class and thus will be borne
on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis by the outstanding shares of such class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Class Expenses may include: (a) Plan Payments relating to a class of shares, (b) transfer agent fees identified
as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (c) stationery, printing, postage, and delivery expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current
shareholders of a specific class, (d) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (e) SEC registration
fees incurred by a class of shares, (f) expenses of Administrative Services Agreements and other administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (g) trustees' fees or expenses
incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, (h) accounting expenses relating solely to one class
of shares, (i) auditors' fees, litigation expenses, and legal fees and expenses relating to a class of shares, and
(j) expenses incurred in connection with shareholders meetings as a result of issues relating to one class of shares.
Any other expense will be allocated as a Class Expense only if such allocation is approved by a further SEC exemptive
order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. AMR may choose to waive or reimburse Class Expenses on certain classes of the Fund on a voluntary, temporary basis.
Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to another.
Applicants believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class
Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. In addition, AMR may waive or reimburse Trust Expenses and/or Fund Expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement
of Class Expenses), but only if the same proportionate amount of Trust Expenses and/or Fund Expenses are waived or
reimbursed for each class of a Fund. Thus, any Trust Expenses that are waived or reimbursed will be credited to each
class of a Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Fund Expenses that are waived or
reimbursed will be credited to each class of that Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Trust Expenses
and Fund Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse
Trust Expenses or Fund Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an amendment to the Prior Order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g),
and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number of classes of shares representing
interests in the same Funds might be deemed to (a) result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g)
and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and (b) violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The proposed Multi-Class Arrangement does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a
Fund, since all shares will participate in all of a Fund's appreciation, income, and expenses in the manner described
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights under the Multi-Class System is
equitable and will not discriminate against any group of shareholders. Investors purchasing shares offered in connection
with a Plan and/or bearing Class Expenses will bear the costs associated with the related services and have exclusive
shareholder voting rights with respect to matters affecting the applicable Plan. Conversely, investors purchasing
shares that are not covered by a plan or not bearing Class Expenses will not be burdened with such expenses or enjoy such
voting rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accordingly, applicants assert that the requested amendment is appropriate in the public interest and is consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Applicants agree that the amended order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate solely
to one or more of the following: (a) Expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Plan, if any, with respect to such class;
(b) the impact of Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following: (i) Transfer agent fees identified
as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (ii) stationery, printing, postage, and delivery expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current
shareholders of a specific class, (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) SEC registration
fees incurred by a class of shares, (v) expenses of Administrative Services Agreements and other administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (vi) Trustees' fees or expenses
incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, (vii) accounting expenses relating solely to one class
of shares, (viii) auditors' fees, litigation expenses, and legal fees and expenses relating to a class of shares,
and (ix) expenses incurred in connection with shareholders meetings as a result of issues relating to one class of
shares; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to matters relating to the Fund's Distribution
Plan, if any, or any other matters appropriately limited to such class(es); (d) the different exchange privileges
of the class of shares, if any; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund. Any additional incremental
expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly applied
to one class of shares shall not be so applied unless and until approved by the SEC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Board of Trustees (the ``Board''), including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the
Trust (``Independent Trustees'') will have approved the Multiple Class System with respect to a particular Fund
prior to the implementation of the system by that Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Board of the Trust regarding
the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Class System
will reflect in detail the reasons for the determination by the Board that the proposed Multiple Class System is in
the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of
the Independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide the Board and the Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written
report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If any class is subject to a Shareholder Services Plan, the Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditure made thereunder were subject to rule
12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On an ongoing basis, the Board of the Trust, pursuant to its fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund, as applicable, for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes
of its shares, if there is more than one class. The Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take
such actions as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. AMR and each Fund's manager
investment adviser(s) and distributor, if any, will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts
to the Board. If such a conflict arises, AMR, and the investment adviser(s) and distributor, if any, at their own expense,
will take such actions as are necessary to remedy such conflict, including establishing a new registered management
investment company, if necessary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Board of each Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Plans
complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements,
only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify
any fee for services charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class
will not be presented to the Board to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations
upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of
their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Dividends and other distributions paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends
and other distributions are paid, will be declared and paid on the same day and at the same time, and will be determined
in the same manner and will be in the same amount, except that the amount of the dividends and other distributions declared
and paid by a particular class may be different from that of another class because Plan Payments made by a class under
a Plan and other Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and other distributions of the
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to the Board of the Trust, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that
the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the
SEC staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management
or a Regional office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial
Analyst, Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate or Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on ``policies and procedures placed in operation'' in accordance
with Statements on Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70, ``Reports on the Processing of Transactions by Service Organizations''
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''). Ongoing reports will be reports on ``policies
and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' prepared in accordance with SAS No. 70
of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from
time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and other distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
action if the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. If any class of shares is distributed by a principal underwriter, the prospectus of such Fund will contain a statement
to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares
of a Fund may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. If any class of shares is distributed by a principal underwriter, the Trust will adopt compliance standards as
to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons
selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the amended exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of
the Board of the Trust with respect to the Multiple Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares, other than AMR Class shares, in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. AMR Class shares will be offered
solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for the AMR class shares will disclose the existence of the
Funds' other classes, and the prospectus for the Funds' other classes will disclose the existence of the AMR Class
shares and will identify the investors eligible to purchase AMR Class shares. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except AMR Class shares. Advertising materials reflecting
the expenses or performance data for AMR Class shares will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase
such shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's
net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. The Funds need not provide
such information with respect to the AMR Class shares; however, to the extent that a Fund chooses to do so, the net asset
value or public offering price of AMR Class shares also will be presented separately.

SEC approval of, authorization of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that any Fund may make pursuant
to a Plan in reliance on the amended exemptive order.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw from Listing and Registration; (EastGroup Properties, Shares
of Beneficial Interest, $1.00 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;7094</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
June 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EastGroup Properties (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its Shares of Beneficial Interest are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's Shares of Beneficial Interest commenced trading on the NYSE
at the opening of business on May 3, 1994, and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading
on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its Share of Beneficial Interest from listing on the Amex, the Company considered
the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its Shares of Beneficial Interest
on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Shares of Beneficial
Interest and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for its Shares of Beneficial Interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before July 1, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Applicants' Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each Applicant Fund is a Minnesota corporation registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.
Except for MIMLIC Money Market Fund, Inc.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 the Applicant Funds currently offer shares to the public at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge (``FESC'').
The shares currently also are subject to ongoing distribution and service fees pursuant to a plan adopted under rule
12b&hyph;1 (the ``Plan'').
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 For shares of the Asset Allocation Fund, the Plan Fees currently are up to .35% of that Fund's average daily net assets;
for shares of each of the other Funds, the Plan Fees are up to .30% of each Fund's average daily net assets.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
MIMLIC Money Market Fund, Inc. (the ``Money Market Fund'') is a no-load fund that currently offers Class A shares to
the public at net asset value. Applicants intend that the Money Market Fund and any other Funds that are ``money market''
Funds, as defined in rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, will continue to issue shares at net asset value without the imposition
of a FESC or CDSC, but that the Money Market Fund may offer multiple classes of shares with variations in distribution
or service fees and in class expenses.

Applicants anticipate that all shareholder servicing fees will be imposed under a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. Nevertheless,
applicants may subsequently decide to impose a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fee. Accordingly, the
term ``Plans,'' as used herein, collectively refers to any rule 12b&hyph;1 plans and any non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder
services plans adopted in accordance with condition 16 below. The term ``Plan Fees'' refers to any fees charged pursuant
to any of the Plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Adviser, a registered investment adviser, serves as each Applicant Fund's investment adviser. The Distributor,
a registered broker-dealer, serves as principal underwriter of the shares of each Applicant Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants seek relief to permit the Funds to offer multiple classes of shares that would differ only as set forth
in condition 1 below. The additional classes may be subject to a FESC, a CDSC, a combination of both, or neither, and
also may be subject to Plan Fees. The Funds will not impose FESCs, CDSCs, or Plan Fees in excess of amounts permitted
by article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
``NASD''), as they may be amended from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under the requested order, the Applicant Funds' currently outstanding shares will be designated ``Class A'' shares.
Applicants contemplate selling a new class of shares (``Class B shares'') at net asset value without the imposition
of a FESC at the time of purchase. Under the applicable rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, Class B shareholders initially will pay
a shareholder services fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average
daily net assets attributable to Class B shares. The Class B shares would be subject to a CDSC, as further described
below. Class B shares would not be issued in connection with investments of $1,000,000 or more, but rather such investors
would be permitted to invest in Class A shares, which would not be subject to a CDSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants contemplate that the Class B shares purchased by a shareholder automatically will convert to Class
A shares of the same Fund after a certain holding period. Class B shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares purchased by a shareholder
converts to Class A shares, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
share of the Class B shares in the sub-account also will convert to Class A shares. Applicants may suspend such conversion
if an expert's opinion or Internal Revenue Service ruling that such conversion does not constitute a taxable event
under Federal income tax law is not available. The conversion feature would benefit long-term Class B shareholders
by relieving them of most of the burden of distribution expenses after the Distributor has been compensated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each service rendered to a specific class of shares will augment or replace, and not be duplicative of, any other
service rendered to the class, or to the Fund. Expenses specific to a particular class of shares may be calculated and
charged to the respective class. All other expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated between the various classes
based on the percentage of net assets of the class at the beginning of the day after adjusting for the prior day's capital
share activity. Because of the differing class expenses and Plan Fees, the net income attributable to and the dividends
payable on one class of shares of a Fund may be higher or lower than those of the other classes of shares of the same Fund.
To the extent that a Fund has undistributed net income, the net asset value of the various classes of shares of the Fund
may differ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants contemplate that any class of shares of a Fund may be exchanged for shares of the corresponding class
of other Funds. Exchanges also are permitted into money market Funds managed by the Adviser. All exchanges will comply
with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants also seek exemptive relief to permit the Funds to impose a CDSC on redemptions of Class B shares, and possibly
other future classes of shares. The period during which the CDSC will apply (the ``CDSC period'') and the CDSC percentage
will vary with the amount of the investment, and is expected to vary in the future depending on any Plan Fees, if any,
imposed by a Fund with respect to the shares subject to the CDSC. The CDSC only would be imposed on shares issued on or
after the date that the requested order is granted. In addition, any amendments to the CDSC will apply only when they
are reflected in an amended and supplemented prospectus, and no such amendments adversely would affect shares issued
prior to the effective date of such amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The applicable CDSC will be calculated on the lesser of the net asset value at the time the shares were issued or redeemed.
No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing capital appreciation, shares or amounts representing shares purchased
through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, or shares held for longer than the CDSC period.
It will be assumed that redemptions will be made first of shares not subject to a CDSC in the order purchased, and then
of shares subject to a CDSC in the order purchased. If a shareholder owns more than one class of shares and does not specify
which shares are to be redeemed, shares not subject to a CDSC with the highest Plan Fees will be redeemed in full prior
to any redemptions of shares not subject to a CDSC with lower Plan Fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants intend to waive the CDSC on redemptions of shares (a) resulting from the exercise of a Fund's right to
liquidate a shareholder's account whose aggregate net asset value is less than the effective minimum size set forth
in the Fund's then-current prospectus, and (b) in the event of the death or disability of a shareholder within the meaning
of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provided that the shareholder held the shares
at the time of death or initial determination of disability, and provided that the shareholder owned the shares as
an individual or as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship or as a tenant-in-common.

Applicants' Legal Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares
representing interests in the same Fund might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning
of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to
the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants further believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in
the manner described in the application is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders.
In addition, such arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges
of each class of shares are substantially identical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants submit that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present any concerns that section 18 was
designed to ameliorate. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowings, does not affect a Fund's existing
assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. The multi-class arrangement will not increase
the speculative character of the shares of the Funds. No class of shares will have preference or priority over any other
class of shares in a Fund with respect to particular assets, and no class of shares will be protected by any reserve or
other account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC is appropriate
in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the
policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having greater
investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales load had been imposed at such time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a Plan
providing for Plan Fees; (c) different expenses which the board of directors of a Fund may in the future determine to
allocate to a specific class, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent
as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing
materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration
fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal
expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating
to one class of shares; (d) voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares (

2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class
distribution system prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors
of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the multi-class distribution system will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed multi-class
distribution system is in the best interest of both the Fund and its shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the class expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and
any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including
a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least
quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor
at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any Plan Fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing
of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any Plan Fee attributable to that class. The
statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the
independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the Plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each such class and except that any class expenses
will be borne by the applicable class of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the
``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, they will render at least annually a report to the Funds
that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the
periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to section 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert
with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management
or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief
Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators.
The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports
will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined
and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may
be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of
income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in its
initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants agree
to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing
reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the multi-class distribution system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the directors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Each Fund prospectus (regardless of whether all classes of shares of such Fund are offered through such prospectus)
will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, Plan Fees, FESC,
CDSC, exchange privileges, and conversion features applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports
of each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every
shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement
of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share
data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent
any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares,
it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes. The information provided by applicants
for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will
separately present each class of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
any Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendments of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the Plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors
shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into
a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior
to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class
shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all
existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares
in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New
Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition
shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or
New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation
of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material
features of the Plan of the Target Class and the relationship of such Plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed
in an effective registration statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

American Electric Power Company, Inc. (``AEP''), a registered holding company, and AEP Generating Company (``Generating''),
an electric public utility subsidiary of AEP, both of 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, have filed a post-effective
amendment to their application-declaration filed under Sections 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 12(d) of the Act and Rules 44
and 45 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated August 17, 1984 (HCAR No. 23399), Generating acquired a 1/2 undivided interest in the Rockport Generating
Station (``Plant'') with Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric Company, now Indiana Michigan Power Company (``I&amp;M''),
also a subsidiary of AEP, including responsibility for 50% of the costs associated with acquiring certain air and
water pollution control devices (``Project'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated October 4, 1984 (HCAR No. 23445) (``October 1984 Order''), Generating was authorized to enter into
an Agreement of Sale (``Agreement'') with the City of Rockport, Indiana (``City'') providing for the construction
and installation of the Project by the City, and the issuance by the City of pollution control revenue bonds (``Series
1984 A bonds'') to finance Generating's share of the Project. The October 1984 Order authorized the issuance of the
Series 1984 A Bonds in a principal amount of $150 million. In addition, the October 1984 Order reserved jurisdiction
``with respect to the fees and commissions to be incurred by [Generating] and AEP in connection with this transaction,
and the terms of sale under the Agreement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated September 6, 1985 (HCAR No. 23821) (``1985 Order''), Generating was authorized to enter into a First
Amendment to Agreement of Sale (``1985 Agreement'') with the City providing for the issuance and sale of three additional
series of pollution control bonds (collectively, ``Series 1985 Bonds''), each in the principal amount of $55 million
with a maturity of September 1, 2014. One series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with a variable interest rate (``Variable
Rate Bonds'') the rate of which was based upon an index and not to exceed 12% per annum, determined weekly and payable
monthly. A second series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with the interest payable semi-annually at a rate which
will be adjusted every five years based upon an index (``Adjustable Bonds''). A third series of the Series 1985 Bonds
was issued with the interest rate fixed at 93/8% per annum, payable semi-annually (``Fixed Rate Bonds''), and these
Fixed Rate Bonds were issued subject to optional redemption following an initial period not to exceed ten years. The
proceeds of the Series 1985 Bonds were used to cover a portion of the cost of construction of the Project and to refund
the outstanding short-term Series 1984 A Bonds in the principal amount of $150 million. The 1985 Order included no
reservation of jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AEP and Generating now propose that Generating entire into an agreement with the City whereby the City will issue and
sell up to $55 million of a series of refunding bonds (``Refunding Bonds'') the net proceeds from the sale of which will
be used to provide for the payment of principal required for the refunding prior to their stated maturity of $55 million
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Bonds. The Refunding Bonds will be issued under and secured by the existing indenture
(``Indenture'') between the City and the Lincoln National Bank and Trust Company, as trustee (``Trustee'') and a
fifth supplemental indenture (``Fifth Supplemental Indenture'') to be execute pursuant to Commission authorization
under this post-effective amendment. Pursuant to the Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the proceeds
of the sale of the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds will be deposited with the Trustee and applied by the Trustee, together
with other funds supplied by Generating, to the redemption of the Series 1985 A Bonds at a price of 102% of the principal
amount thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is stated that the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds will bear interest semi-annually and mature at a date or dates not more
than 40 years from the date of their issuance. The Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds may be subject to mandatory or optional
redemption under circumstances and terms specified at the time of pricing, and, if it is deemed advisable, may also
include a sinking fund provision. In addition, the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds may not, if it is deemed advisable, be
redeemable at the option of the City in whole or in part at any time for a period to be determined at the time of pricing
the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generating has been advised that, depending on maturity and other factors, the annual interest rate on obligations,
interest on which is so excludable from gross income, historically has been, and can be expected at the time of issuance
of the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds to be, 11/2% to 21/2% or more lower than the rates of obligations of like terms and comparable
quality, interest on which is fully subject to Federal income tax. In any event, on series or Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds
will be issued at rates in excess of those generally obtained at the time of pricing for sales of substantially similar
tax-exempt bonds (having the same maturity, issued by entities of comparable credit quality and having similar terms,
conditions and features). As of June 1, 1994, Generating anticipated that the interest rate for the Refunding Fixed
Rate Bonds would be 7.25% without any credit enhancement and 6.75% with bond insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generating will not agree, without further Commission authorization, to the issuance of any Refunding Fixed Rate
Bond by the City (i) if the stated maturity of any such Bond shall be more than forth (40) years, (ii) if the rate of interest
to be borne by any such Bond shall exceed 8% per annum, (iii) if the discount from the initial public offering price of
any such Bond shall exceed 5% of the principal amount thereof, or (iv) if the initial public offering price shall be
less than 95% of the principal amount thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generating also proposes to provide credit enhancement for the Refunding Bonds in the form of a letter of credit, surety
bond or bond insurance and pay any related fees. As a supplement or alternative to a letter of credit, surety bond or
bond insurance, AEP proposes to guarantee the Refunding Bonds. Any letter of credit would not exceed $55 million and
would be for a term ranging from one to five years and would be renewable. Drawings under the letter of credit would bear
interest at no more than 1% above the bank's prime rate. Generating may pay an annual fee which would not exceed 1.25%
of the face amount of the letter of credit.

1. Applicant, a Massachusetts business trust, registered as an open-end, diversified management investment company
on August 12, 1981, by filing a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act.
On the same date, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and pursuant
to section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on March 12, 1982. Applicant's public
offering commenced soon thereafter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On January 19, 1994, the board of trustees of applicant, including a majority of trustees who were not interested
persons of applicant, approved a plan of reorganization (the ``Plan''). The Plan provided that applicant would transfer
all its assets and stated liabilities to the Wright Managed U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (``Treasury Fund''),
a series of The Wright Managed Income Trust (a Massachusetts business trust), in exchange for shares of Treasury Fund.
Pursuant to rule 17a&hyph;8, applicant's trustees determined that the sale of applicant's assets to Treasury Fund
was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would
not be diluted as a result.

Applicant and Treasury Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment
adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the
Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated
persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.

3. Preliminary copies of proxy materials to solicit shareholder approval of the reorganization were filed with the
SEC on January 28, 1994. Definitive proxy materials were distributed to applicant's shareholders of record as of
February 28, 1994, and filed with the SEC on March 10, 1994. At a meeting of shareholders of applicant held on March 28,
1994, applicant's shareholders approved the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On March 31, 1994, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred all its assets to Treasury Fund in
exchange for shares of beneficial interest in Treasury Fund and the assumption by Treasury Fund of the stated liabilities
of applicant. The exchanges were made at net asset value determined as of the close of business on March 30, 1994. As
of such date, applicant had an aggregate net asset value of $16,978,270.79. Each of applicant's shareholders received
shares of Treasury Fund that represented the same aggregate net asset value as the shares of applicant owned by such
shareholder immediately before the reorganization.

respectively. Treasury Fund incurred reorganization expenses for legal and accounting services of $12,200 and
$2,500, respectively.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA is bound by the provisions of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.'' SBA has
promulgated regulations spelling out its obligations under that Executive Order. See 13 CFR Part 135, effective
September 30, 1983.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accord with these regulations, specifically 135.4, SBA is publishing this notice to provide public awareness
of the pending application of twenty-two existing Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) for refunding. Also
published herewith is an annotated program announcement describing the SBDC program in detail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is being published three months in advance of the expected date of refunding these SBDCs. Relevant information
identifying these SBDCs and providing their mailing address is provided below. In addition to this publication,
a copy of this notice is being simultaneously furnished to the affected State single point of contact which has been
established under the Executive Order.

The State single points of contact and other interested State and local entities are expected to advise the relevant
SBDC of their comments regarding the proposed refunding in writing as soon as possible. The SBDC proposal cannot be
inconsistent with any area-wide plan providing assistance to small business, if there is one, which has been adopted
by an agency recognized by the State government as authorized to do so. Copies of such written comments should also
be furnished to Ms. Johnnie L. Albertson, Associate Administrator for SBDC Program, U.S. Small Business Administration,
409 Third Street, SW., Fifth Floor, Washington, DC 20416. Comments will be accepted by the relevant SBDC and SBA for
a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice. The relevant SBDC will make every effort to accommodate
these comments during the 90-day period. If the comments cannot be accommodated by the relevant SBDC, SBA will, prior
to refunding the SBDC, either attain accommodation of any comments or furnish an explanation of why accommodation
cannot be attained to the commentor prior to refunding the SBDC.

Description of the SBDC Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBDC operates under the general management and oversight of SBA, but with recognition that a partnership exists
between the Agency and the SBDC for the delivery of assistance to the small business community. SBDC services shall
be provided pursuant to a negotiated Cooperative Agreement with full participation of both parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBDCs operate on the basis of a state plan to provide assistance within a state or designated geographical area. The
initial plan must have the written approval of the Governor. As a condition to any financial award made to an applicant,
non-Federal funds must be provided from sources other than the Federal Government. SBDCs operate under the provisions
of P.L. 96&hyph;302, as amended by P.L. 98&hyph;395, a Notice of Award (Cooperative Agreement) issued by SBA, and
the provisions of this Program Announcement.

Purpose and Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBDC Program is designed to provide quality assistance to small businesses in order to promote growth, expansion,
innovation, increased productivity and management improvement. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources
of the Federal, State, and local governments with the resources of the educational system and the private sector to
meet the specialized and complex needs of the small business community. SBDCs also coordinate with other SBA programs
of business development and utilize the expertise of these affiliated resources to expand services and avoid duplication
of effort.

Program Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall objective of the SBDC Program is to leverage Federal dollars and resources with those of the state, academic
community and private sector to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) strengthen the small business community;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) contribute to the economic growth of the communities served;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) make assistance available to more small businesses than is now possible with present Federal resources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) create a broader based delivery system to the small business community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
SBDC Program Organization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBDCs are organized to provide maximum services to the local small business community. The lead SBDC receives financial
assistance from the SBA to operate a statewide SBDC Program. In states where more than one organization receives SBA
financial assistance to operate an SBDC, each lead SBDC is responsible for Program operations throughout a specific
regional area to be served by the SBDC. The lead SBDC is responsible for establishing a network of SBDC subcenters to
offer service coverage to the small business community. The SBDC network is managed and directed by a full-time Director.
SBDCs must ensure that at least 80 percent of Federal funds provided are used to provide services to small businesses.
To the extent possible, SBDCs provide services by enlisting volunteer and other low cost resources on a statewide
basis.

SBDC Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific types of services to be offered are developed in coordination with the SBA district office which has jurisdiction
over a given SBDC. SBDCs emphasize the provision of indepth, high-quality assistance to small business owners or
prospective small business owners in complex areas that require specialized expertise. These areas may include,
but are not limited to: management, marketing, financing, accounting, strategic planning, regulation and taxation,
capital formation, procurement assistance, human resource management, production, operations, economic and
business data analysis, engineering, technology transfer, innovation and research, new product development,
product analysis, plant layout and design, agri-business, computer application, business law information, and
referral (any legal services beyond basic legal information, and referral require the endorsement of the State Bar
Association), exporting, office automation, site selection, or any other areas of assistance required to promote
small business growth, expansion, and productivity within the State. The SBDC shall also ensure that a full range
of business development and technical assistance services are made available to small businesses located in rural
areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The degree to which SBDC resources are directed towards specific areas of assistance is determined by local community
needs, SBA priorities and SBDC Program objectives and agreed upon by the SBA district office and the SBDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBDC must offer quality training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing and prospective small business
owners. As a general guideline, SBDCs should emphasize the provision of training in specialized areas other than
basic small business management subjects. SBDCs should also emphasize training designed to reach particular audiences
such as members of SBA priority and special emphasis groups.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance may request that the Secretary determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials used to produce such substance. This determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules relating to the determination process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that dimethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terephthalate should be added to the list of taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective April 1, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for dimethyl terephthalate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 4671(b)(3), is $3.23 per ton. This is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon a conversion factor for xylene of 0.547 and a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor for methane of 0.165. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner is Cape Industries, a manufacturer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exporter of this substance. No material comments were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received on this petition. The following information is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for the determination.

Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance may request that the Secretary determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials used to produce such substance. This determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that glycerine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and phenol should be added to the list of taxable substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 4672(a)(3), effective January 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for glycerine, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4671(b)(3), is $9.52 per ton. This is based upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion factor for propylene of 0.67, a conversion factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for chlorine of 2.16, and a conversion factor for sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydroxide of 1.54. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for phenol, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4671(b)(3), is $6.33 per ton. This is based upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion factor for benzene of 0.9 and a conversion factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for propylene of 0.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 butanediol should be added to the list of taxable
substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective October 1, 1994. However, if these substances are produced from acetylene
derived from coal they are not taxable substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for tetrahydrofuran, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.28 per ton unless it is produced from
acetylene derived from coal. This is based upon a conversion factor for acetylene of 0.40 and a conversion factor for
methane of 0.97. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for 1,4 butanediol, under section 4671(b)(3), is $4.20 per ton unless it is produced from
acetylene derived from coal. This is based upon a conversion factor for methane of 0.77 and a conversion factor for
acetylene of 0.32.

Tetrahyrofuran is derived from the taxable chemicals methane and acetylene. Tetrahyrofuran is a liquid produced
predominantly by the reaction of acetylene (derived from methane in natural gas) with formaldehyde made by air oxidation
and dehydrogenation of methanol (derived from methane in natural gas) producing the intermediate butynediol which
is in turn reacted with hydrogen (derived from methane in natural gas) to produce 1,4 butanediol. The 1,4 butanediol
is ring closed using an acid catalyst to produce tetrahydrofuran.

1,4 butanediol is derived from the taxable chemicals methane and acetylene. 1,4 butanediol is a liquid produced predominantly
by the reaction of acetylene (derived from methane in natural gas) with formaldehyde made by air oxidation and dehydrogenation
of methanol (derived from methane in natural gas) producing the intermediate butynediol which is in turn reacted
with hydrogen (derived from methane in natural gas) to produce 1,4 butanediol.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Notice announces the availability of funds for assistance under VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program.
This is a new program authorized by Pub. L. 102&hyph;590, the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act
of 1992. Funding was appropriated by the Department's appropriations act for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124,
approved October 28, 1993). Funding applied for under this Notice may be used for: (1) Expansion, remodeling or alteration
of existing buildings; (2) acquisition of buildings, and acquisition and rehabilitation of buildings; (3) new construction;
(4) procurement of vans; and (5) per diem payments, or in-kind assistance through VA in lieu of per diem payments, for
eligible applicants who established supportive housing or supportive services programs after November 10, 1992.
Applicants may apply for more than one type of assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants may not receive assistance to replace funds provided by any State or local government to assist homeless
persons. For existing projects, VA will fund only the portion of the project that will expand the program. A proposal
for an existing project that seeks to shift its focus by changing the population to be served or the precise mix of services
to be offered is not eligible for consideration. Not more than 25 percent of services available in projects funded
through this grant program may be provided to clients who are not receiving those services as veterans.

In calling the meeting, the Board determined, on motion of Director Jonathan L. Fiechter (Acting Director, Office
of Thrift Supervision), seconded by Director Eugene A. Ludwig (Comptroller of the Currency), concurred in by Acting
Chairman Andrew C. Hove, Jr., that Corporation business required its consideration of the matters on less than seven
days' notice to the public; that no earlier notice of the meeting was practicable; that the public interest did not
require consideration of the matters in a meeting open to public observation; and that the matters could be considered
in a closed meeting by authority of subsections (c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(8), (c)(9)(A)(ii), (c)(9)(B), and (c)(10) of
the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(8), (c)(9)(A)(ii), (c)(9)(B), and (c)(10)).

I. Purpose and Substantive Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Background and Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments (HCDA) of 1978 created the Flexible Subsidy Program
to provide Operating Assistance to eligible projects experiencing financial difficulty. Operating Assistance
is provided in the form of a deferred loan and, in conjunction with other resources, is designed to restore or maintain
the physical and financial soundness of eligible projects. The 1983 amendments to section 201 of the HCDA expanded
the universe of eligible projects and clarified that a project need not have an FHA-insured mortgage to be eligible
for Flexible Subsidy assistance (e.g., a non-insured section 236 project is eligible).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 201 of HCDA to create a new category of assistance
to be provided under the Flexible Subsidy Program for projects that needed capital improvements to achieve physical
soundness that cannot be funded from project reserve funds without jeopardizing other major repairs or replacements
that are reasonably expected to be required in the near future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1987 amendments to the Flexible Subsidy statute (Sections 185 and 186 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1987) also recognized the need to coordinate assistance under the Flexible Subsidy Program with the initiative
to preserve low- and moderate-income housing, enacted in Title II of that Act. (In its comprehensive revision of the
1987 Act, Title VI of the 1990 Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, at the new section 219, repeated
the listing of incentives the Secretary could agree to provide an owner as part of a plan of action to prevent prepayment
of a mortgage on a project serving low- and moderate-income tenants. A capital improvement loan was included as an
incentive to owners.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 405 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, in addition to making other amendments, removed
the priority for ELIHPA-eligible projects and imposed certain exclusivity restrictions on Flexible Subsidy-assisted
and ELIHPA- and LIHPRHA-eligible projects. These provisions have been repealed by section 103(b) of the Multifamily
Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (the 1994 Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201(n)(1) of the HCDA, as amended by section 103(b)(3) of the 1994 Act, authorizes the Department to set aside
assistance for Capital Improvement Loans for projects that are eligible for incentives under ELIPHA. In addition,
under section 201(n)(1), the Department is authorized to make this assistance available on a noncompetitive basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice supports preservation efforts by announcing a set-aside of $20 million for Flexible Subsidy Capital
Improvement funding to insured projects that are eligible under ELIHPA to receive incentives in exchange for extending
the low- to moderate-income use of the projects under plans of action approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 248, subpart
C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Flexible Subsidy Fund is comprised of excess rental receipts paid to HUD from owners of Section 236 projects, interest
earned on the fund, repayment of Operating Assistance loans made by the Department in past fiscal years, and amounts
appropriated by Congress, if any, to carry out the purposes of the Flexible Subsidy Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Capital Improvement Loan portion of the program is required by statute (Section 201(j)(4)) to be funded at a minimum
level of $30 million or 40 percent of the amount in the Flexible Subsidy fund, whichever is less. This year, $30 million
is less than 40 percent of the fund, and therefore, is the amount designated for Capital Improvement Loans. Of the $30
million set aside for Capital Improvement funding, $20 million is available under this NOFA for preservation projects.
The remaining $10 million was made available under the Flexible Subsidy NOFA, published on January 13, 1994, at 59
FR 2270.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The assistance is necessary, when considered with other resources available to the project; it will restore or
maintain the financial or physical soundness of the project; and it will preserve the low- and moderate-income character
of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The owner has agreed to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project for a period at least equal
to the remaining term of the project mortgage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The project is or can reasonably be made structurally sound, as determined in accordance with an on-site inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. All reasonable attempts have been made to take all appropriate actions and provide suitable housing for project
residents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Other Loan Terms and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Repair items eligible for funding as a Capital Improvement Loan include any major repair or replacement of building
components or other on-site improvements included in allowable costs when the project was built, (e.g., sewer laterals,
roof structures, ceilings, wall or floor structures, foundations, plumbing, heating, cooling, electrical systems
and major equipment), as well as any major repair or replacement of any short-lived building equipment or component
before the expiration of its useful life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improvements eligible for funding may also include limited supplements or enhancements to mechanical equipment,
to the extent they are needed for the health and safety of the residents (e.g., air conditioning, heating equipment,
and building sprinkler systems), where they do not exist; improvements necessary to comply with HUD's standards
in 24 CFR part 8 for accessibility to individuals with handicaps; and cost effective energy efficiency improvements.
Improvements eligible for funding as a Capital Improvement Loan do not include maintenance of any building components
or equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capital Improvement assistance may be provided in the form of an amortizing loan. The interest rate on the loan may
not be less than three (3) percent (unless HUD determines that a lower rate is necessary to maintain rental rates, in
accordance with Chapter 12 of HUD Handbook 4350.6, Processing Plans of Action Under the Low-Income Housing Preservation
and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 and Form HUD&hyph;90010, Owner's Calculation of Tenant Rent Phase-In Due
to POA approval, but in no case less than one percent) nor more than six (6) percent. The rate is determined taking into
consideration the project's ability to absorb the rent increase and the percentage of the tenants receiving rental
assistance. Interest on the Capital Improvement Loan starts to accrue and the loan amortization period begins immediately
upon disbursement of loan proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Capital Improvement Loan to a nonprofit organization may be in the form of a deferred note with a term coincident with
the expiration of the project's insured mortgage note, accruing interest at a rate of one (1) percent. The deferred
note will become due and payable upon a sale or refinancing of the project or at the expiration of the insured mortgage
note.

all management deficiencies including actions which will be performed to improve management and personnel and upgrade
tenant services, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Action Items must address all project deficiencies, including those which are to be corrected using resources other
than Flexible Subsidy assistance. Action Items must be written in a manner which specifically describes the scope
of the work and provides an estimate of the cost of the work to be performed. In addition, they must be structured so as
to be highly visible items for which expenditures and work progress can be easily monitored. For example, if boilers
are to be replaced, the description should identify the malfunctioning unit, its age, and its location, e.g., building
number, basement/roof. A further explanation should identify the replacement unit, the estimated cost per unit
and the labor cost associated with the entire replacement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352), and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 29912). See 24 CFR Part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in
these ways, they are urged to read 24 CFR Part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions concerning Part 86 should be directed to Garry L. Phillips, Acting Director, Office of Ethics, Room
2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone:
(202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may
be obtained from the local HUD office.

Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 of the Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not
authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance that entails a competition
for its distribution. HUD's regulations implementing section 103 are codified at 24 CFR part 4 (see 56 FR 22088, May
13, 1991). (See also Section II.C. of this NOFA.) In accordance with the requirements of Section 103, HUD employees
involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions under a competitive funding process
are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee
of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons
who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR
part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section I. Important Pre-Application Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. What is the purpose of this solicitation notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice solicits pre-applications from eligible organizations and institutions for grants to support projects
to design, demonstrate, or disseminate practices, methods, or techniques related to environmental education as
specified under Section 6 of the National Environmental Education Act of 1990 (the Act). The Section 6 Environmental
Education Grants Program is separate from the Environmental Education and Training Program authorized under Section
5 of the Act in which EPA awards a cooperative agreement on a three year basis to support a national teacher training
program. For information on the teacher training program, contact the EPA representative listed at the end of this
notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. When is my pre-application due to EPA and when will EPA announce the grant awards?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pre-applications (a signed original plus two copies of the original) must be mailed to EPA postmarked no later than
Friday, October 14, 1994. Pre-applications which are postmarked after October 14, 1994 will not be considered for
funding. EPA expects to announce the grant awards in the Spring of 1995.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Do I mail my pre-application to EPA headquarters or an EPA regional office? Is there a difference between the type
of project that is funded by EPA headquarters as opposed to EPA's regional offices?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pre-applications requesting between $25,001 and $250,000 in federal environmental education grant funds must
be mailed to EPA headquarters in Washington, DC. Pre-applications requesting $25,000 or less in federal environmental
education grant funds must be mailed to the EPA regional office where the project will take place (rather than to the
regional office where the applicant is located, if these locations are different). A list of addresses is included
at the end of this notice. The EPA headquarters and regional grants will be evaluated using the same criteria as defined
in this solicitation. The only difference between grants that are awarded by EPA headquarters and by EPA's regional
offices is the size of the grant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Where do I get the information and forms needed to prepare my pre-application?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA strongly encourages applicants to read the solicitation notice carefully. This notice contains all the information
and forms necessary to prepare a pre-application. If your project is selected as a finalist after the evaluation process
is concluded, EPA will provide you with additional forms that must be completed in order to process your pre-application
further.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. How much money can I request and how does the dollar amount requested affect my chance of being funded?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants may request up to the statutory ceiling of $250,000 in environmental education grant funds for any one
grant. However, pre-applications which request relatively small amounts of funding have a much better chance of
being funded because EPA awards a much greater number of grants at lower funding levels. A significant number of small
awards are made because EPA is required, under Section 6(i) of the Act, to award 25% of funds for grants of $5,000 or less.
In addition, EPA has chosen to award very few of the largest grants (e.g., those over $100,000) so that we may support
a greater number of efforts. Thus, your chance of being funded increases dramatically as the amount of money you request
decreases as illustrated below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has awarded grants under the Environmental Education Grants Program in Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and 1994. Individual
awards have ranged from less than $5,000 up to $250,000. During this three year period, EPA has funded only about 10
proposals annually for projects requesting between $25,001 and $250,000; only 1 proposal each year has been funded
at or near the $250,000 level. By contrast, EPA has funded about 30 proposals annually for projects requesting between
$5,001 and $25,000. Furthermore, EPA has funded about 200 proposals annually for projects requesting $5,000 or less.
EPA has received between 1,500 and 3,000 pre-applications each year. To increase your chance of obtaining funding
in FY 1995, EPA strongly encourages applicants to request regional grants of $5,000 or less. If larger sums are needed,
EPA strongly encourages applicants to request a headquarters grant closer to $25,000 rather than the maximum of $250,000.

Section II. Laws and Regulations Governing Grants Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Under what authority has this grants program been established and what laws and regulations do I need to follow in
applying for a grant?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1990, the President signed the National Environmental Education Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;619) into
law. Section 6 of the Act requires that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administer an environmental
education grants program to support projects that design, demonstrate, or disseminate practices, methods, or techniques
related to environmental education. The Act also requires that EPA establish a program which includes a process for
soliciting, selecting, supervising, evaluating results, and disseminating information on the effectiveness
of projects funded under this program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published the Environmental Education Grant Program Regulations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 9, 1992 which provides additional information on how EPA is administering this program (57 FR 8390; Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 47 (40 CFR part 47). In addition to the requirements of the Act and part 47,
recipients of section 6 grants must comply with EPA's general assistance regulations at 40 CFR part 31 for states,
local governments, and Indian tribes and Part 30 for all others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. How much money has Congress appropriated for this grants program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires that 38% of the total funds Congress appropriates in a given fiscal year under the National Environmental
Education Act be awarded as grants under the section 6 environmental education grants program. Based on this percentage,
EPA has awarded approximately $8.1 million in grants under section 6 of the Act over the past three years (approximately
$2.5 in Fiscal Year 1992, $2.7 in Fiscal Year 1993, and $2.9 in Fiscal Year 1994). EPA will award grants in Fiscal Year
1995 subject to the amount of funds appropriated by Congress. EPA may use up to 15% of these funds to support environmental
education projects which meet the requirements under section 6, but are outside of the competitive process established
under the solicitation notice. If funds are used in this manner, EPA will publish a separate solicitation notice in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to cover the award of these funds.

Section III. Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Who is eligible to submit pre-applications?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any local or tribal education agency, college or university, state education or environmental agency, not-for-profit
organization, or noncommercial educational broadcasting entity may submit a pre-application. These terms are
defined in Section 3 of the Act and 40 CFR 47.105.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. May an organization submit more than one pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Yes, an organization may submit more than one pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995, but only if the pre-applications
are for completely different projects. For example, a national non-profit organization or a large university may
wish to submit pre-applications from different chapters or departments for different projects. No organization
will be awarded more than one grant for the same project during the same fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. May I submit a pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995 even though I have been awarded funding under this program for
Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and/or 1994?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Yes, applicants who were awarded funding previously may submit a pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995. The Fiscal
Year 1995 pre-application may or may not have any relationship to the project funded in a previous year. Every pre-application
for Fiscal Year 1995 will be evaluated based upon the merit of the proposed project in relation to the other Fiscal Year
1995 pre-applications and the new criteria set forth in this solicitation, regardless of whether the proposal would
expand a project funded in a previous year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. May a teacher or educator apply?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No, an individual teacher or educator cannot apply. Only education agencies and organizations_not individuals_are
eligible to apply for grants. For example, a teacher's school, school district, or state or local education agency

Section IV. Eligible Activities and Funding Priorities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. What type of activities are eligible for funding under this program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As specified in the Act, the environmental education activities that are eligible to receive funding under this program
must include at least one of, but are not limited to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The design, demonstration, or dissemination of environmental curricula, including development of educational
tools and material;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The design and demonstration of field methods, practices, and techniques, including assessment of environmental
and ecological conditions and analysis of environmental pollution problems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The assessment of a specific environmental issue or a specific environmental problem;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The provision of training or related education for teachers, faculty, or related personnel in a specific geographic
area or region; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The design and demonstration of projects to foster international cooperation in addressing environmental issues
and problems involving the United States and Canada or Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.L.1. above, EPA strongly encourages applicants to focus on the demonstration or dissemination
of existing environmental curricula rather than the design or development of new curricula. Environmental educators
and other experts have conveyed to EPA that the field needs to improve its use and dissemination of existing curricula
more than it needs to develop new curricula. Focusing on demonstrating or disseminating existing curricula will
also help ensure that federal funds are not used to duplicate already existing curricula.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, EPA does recognize that there are gaps in the types of curricula that presently exist and that there is
some difficulty in gaining access to quality materials. Thus, applicants who propose to design new curricula in their
pre-applications must demonstrate that there is a need to develop these new materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the applicant may show that the curriculum proposed for development has not been designed for a particular
target audience, that existing curricula cannot be adapted well to a particular local environmental concern, or
that existing curricula are not otherwise readily accessible. In demonstrating the need for new curricula, the applicant
must specify what steps they have taken to determine this need (e.g., the applicant may cite a conference where this
need was discussed, the results of inquiries made within the community or with various educational institutions
or organizations, or a published survey or research document).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
M. What activities are not eligible for funding under this program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds cannot be used for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. construction projects;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. technical training of environmental management professionals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. non-educational research and development; and/or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. environmental information projects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.M.1., EPA will not fund construction activities such as the acquisition of real property
(including buildings) or the construction or modification of any building. EPA may, however, fund activities such
as creating a nature trail or building a bird watching station as long as these items are an integral part of the proposed
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.M.4., EPA will fund only environmental education projects as opposed to projects that
are solely designed to develop or disseminate environmental information. The long term goal of environmental education
is to increase public awareness and knowledge about environmental issues as well as provide the public with the skills
necessary to make informed decisions and the motivation to take responsible actions. Environmental education enhances
critical-thinking, problem-solving, and effective decision-making skills and may take place in formal or informal
settings. Environmental education engages and motivates individuals, and enables them to weigh various sides of
an environmental issue to make informed and responsible decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental information provides facts or opinions about environmental issues or problems, but does not enhance
critical-thinking, problem-solving, or effective decision-making skills. Although information is an essential
element of an educational effort, environmental information is not, by itself, environmental education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
N. What kind of projects will EPA consider funding?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will consider funding only those proposed projects which meet the criteria specified under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 below. Any proposed project which does not meet these criteria will not be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As required under the Act, all projects must develop an environmental education practice, method, or technique
which meets all three of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Is new or significantly improved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Demonstrates the potential for wide application; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Addresses a high priority environmental issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA defined the terms ``new or significantly improved,'' ``wide application,'' and ``a high priority environmental
issue'' in ``relative terms'' (i.e., applicants must define these terms as they relate to their individual projects).
For example, in reference to Section IV.N.1.a., EPA may consider a project new or significantly improved if it reaches
a specific community or audience for the first time, develops a new or improved teaching strategy, or uses a new or improved
method of applying existing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.N.1.b., EPA may consider a project to have wide application if it targets a large and diverse
audience in terms of numbers and demographics. It may also have wide application if it can serve as a model program elsewhere
such as another school, community, state, or region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.N.1.c., EPA may consider that a project addresses a high priority environmental issue
if the applicant demonstrates that a particular issue is important to the community, state, or region being targeted
by the project. For example, one community may have significant air pollution problems which would make teaching
about solutions to air pollution important to that community. In another community, unplanned development may threaten
a nearby wildlife habitat, thus, making habitat or ecosystem protection a high priority issue. In still another community,
urban decay may make education about lead poisoning from paint or lead pipes important, especially for culturally
diverse or low-income residents who often live in inner-city communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All proposals must also focus on one of the following types of projects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Projects that improve educators' environmental education teaching skills (e.g., through workshops); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Projects that build state, local, or tribal capacity to develop and deliver environmental education programs;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Projects that educate members of a community through a grassroots community-based organization; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Projects that motivate the general public to be more environmentally conscious in making informed decisions and
taking responsible actions through vehicles such as print, film, or broadcast media. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All pre-applications must clearly identify which type of project, described under Section IV.N.2.a, b, c, or d above,
the proposal will focus on. Note that these types of projects have been chosen precisely because they reach different
audiences through different means. EPA believes that requiring you to focus on one of the above types of projects will
help ensure that your proposal has a clear target audience and a well defined vehicle for reaching that audience. Although
your proposal may include more than one of the types of projects described above, doing so will not likely improve your
chance of being funded (unless focusing on more than one strengthens rather than dilutes the focus of your proposal).
EPA's overall goal is to fund a balanced range of projects to increase environmental literacy throughout the country
as described under Section VI.V.1&hyph;6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.N.2.a., the term workshop 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refers to training activities that better prepare educators to utilize existing or new environmental education
materials. Such workshops may be directed toward young people and/or adults in formal and/or informal settings.
A formal setting is a school or other similar institution devoted to learning and an informal setting includes institutions
such as museums, nature centers, parks, and community centers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workshops should emphasize the process, problem-solving, and investigative approach to learning that is a fundamental
aspect of most established environmental education materials and curricula. Workshops should, in all cases, use
a ``hands-on'' process approach to learning that leads to the development of problem-solving and critical-thinking
skills. Workshops may be specific to a particular set of environmental education materials and may include youth
leaders and other professionals who work in the environmental education field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.N.2.b., the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
building state, local, or tribal capacity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refers to the development and implementation of plans designed to improve the coordinated delivery of environmental
education at the state, local, or tribal level. Pre-applications addressing this priority should involve a coordinated
effort by the primary environmental education providers from the respective state, local, or tribal government
in the planning and implementation of the project. Examples of primary environmental education providers includes
State Departments of Education or Natural Resources, local school districts, and state, local, and tribal environmental
education coordinating councils or associations. Examples of how an applicant may propose to build state, local,
or tribal capacity includes the development of plans for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identifying and assessing needs as well as setting priorities for environmental education; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Creating grant programs or identifying funding sources for environmental education providers; and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identifying environmental education teacher training needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to Section IV.N.2.c., the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
grassroots community-based organization 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refers to organizations in which local problems are addressed by individuals who reside in the community being served.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V. The Pre-Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O. What is a pre-application?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pre-application contains three parts: (1) The ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (Standard Form 424/SF
424, attached), (2) the ``Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs'' (Standard Form 424A/SF 424A, attached),
and (3) a work plan (described below). To ensure your pre-application is completed properly, carefully follow the
instructions on the SF 424, SF 424A, and those provided below. The SF 424, SF 424A, and the completed work plan contain
all the information EPA will use to evaluate the merits of your pre-application. Applicants will not be asked to submit
additional information to support their projects unless applicants are identified as finalist. Finalists will
be asked to submit various other forms necessary to complete formal application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
P. Are matching funds required?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Yes, non-federal matching funds of at least 25% of the total cost of the project are required, although EPA encourages
matching funds of greater than 25%. Federal funds to support the project must not exceed 75% of the total cost of the
project. The 25% match may be provided by the applicant or any other organization or institution, except that no portion
of the 25% match can include federal funds (unless specifically authorized by statute). The 25% match may be provided
in cash or by in-kind contributions and other non-cash support. In-kind contributions often include salaries or
other verifiable costs. In the case of salaries, applicants may use either minimum wage or fair market value. The proposed
match, including the value of in-kind contributions, is subject to negotiation with EPA. All grants are subject to
audit, so the value of in-kind contributions must be carefully documented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The matching non-federal share is a percentage of the entire cost of the project. For example, if the 75% federal portion
is $5,000, then the entire project should, at a minimum, have a budget of $6,667, with the recipient providing a contribution
of $1,667. The amount of non-federal funds, including in-kind contributions, must be briefly itemized in Block 15
of the SF 424 included at the end of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Can I use federal funds other than those provided by this program to support the same project?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Yes, you may use federal funds other than those provided by the Environmental Educational Grants Program to support
the same project, but only for different activities. Furthermore, you may not use any federal funds to meet all or any
part of the required 25% match as stated in Section V.P. above. If you have already been awarded federal funds for a project
in which you are seeking additional support from this program, you must indicate in the budget section of the work plan
that you have been awarded other federal support for this project. You must also identify the project officer, agency,
office, address, phone number, and the amount of the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
R. Can I request funding for any budget category on the SF 424A (i.e., personnel/salaries, fringe benefits, travel,
equipment, supplies, contractual, construction, and indirect charges)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Yes, you may request funding for any of the budget categories identified above with the following exceptions. First,
as indicated under Section VI.M.1. above, EPA will not fund the acquisition of real property (including buildings)
or the construction or modification of any building under this program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, you may request funds to pay for salaries, but only for those personnel who are directly involved in implementing
the proposed project and whose salaries are directly related to specific products or outcomes of the proposed project.
EPA also strongly encourages applicants to request reasonable amounts of funding for salaries. Third, you may include
a request for indirect costs if your organization has already negotiated and received an indirect cost rate from the
federal government.

Work plans must be no more than 10 pages for requests for federal funds of more than $5,000 from this environmental education
grants program and no more than 5 pages for requests of $5,000 or less. These page limits apply only to Section V.S.3.a,
b, and c. of the work plan (i.e., the ``summary,'' ``project description,'' and ``project evaluation and sustainability'').
These page limits do not apply to Section V.S.3.d. (i.e., the ``appendices''). ``One page'' refers to one side of a
single-spaced typed page. The pages must be letter sized (81/2 &times; 11 inches), with normal type size (10 or 12 cpi)
and at least 1 inch margins. To conserve paper, please provide double-sided copies of the pre-application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only appendices EPA will accept are a budget, resumes of key personnel, and commitment letters from organizations
with a significant role in the project. EPA will not accept brochures, video tapes, notebooks, photographs, curriculum
samples, or any other supporting material not described as part of the work plan under Section V.S.3.a, b, c, and d.

Section VI. Review and Selection Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
U. How will pre-applications be reviewed and who will conduct the reviews?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pre-applications will be reviewed in two phases_the screening phase and the evaluation phase. During the screening
phase, pre-applications will be reviewed to determine whether they are consistent with the requirements described
in Section IV.L.1&hyph;5., Section IV.M.1&hyph;4., and Section V.S.3.a-d. Only those pre-applications which
meet all of these requirements will enter the evaluation phase of the review process. During the evaluation phase,
pre-applications will be evaluated based upon the quality of their work plans, especially the degree to which the
work plan meets the requirements set forth in Section IV.N.1.a-c. and Section IV.N.2.a-d.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reviewers conducting the screening and evaluation phases of the review process will include EPA officials and external
environmental educators approved by EPA. At the conclusion of the evaluation phase, the reviewers will rank each
applicant's work plan based upon the scoring system identified in Section V.S.3.a, b, c, and d.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
V. How will the final selections be made?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After individual projects are evaluated and ranked by the reviewers as described under Section VI.U. above, EPA officials
in the regions and at headquarters will identify finalists among the highest ranking pre-applications. In identifying
finalists and making final selections, EPA's goal is to fund projects that, when viewed together, provide a balance
among the types of projects being funded, by taking into account the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The target audience and their socioeconomic status;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The methods used to reach the target audience;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The type of organization submitting the proposal and/or whether the proposal makes effective use of partnerships;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The type of environmental issue addressed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The geographic location of the project; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
socioeconomic status,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under Section VI.V.1. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicants to submit proposals that promote environmental
justice for culturally-diverse and low-income populations. EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in
the evaluation process and which promote environmental justice. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
environmental justice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and income with respect to the development, implementation
and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no racial, ethnic,
or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting
from the operation of industrial, municipal, and commercial enterprises and from the execution of federal, state,
local, and tribal programs and policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts to address environmental justice through environmental education may include educational programs that
provide culturally-diverse and low-income populations with critical-thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making
skills to identify, assess, and address an environmental problem that has a disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental impact in their community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
effective use of partnerships,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under Section VI.V.3. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicants to submit proposals which form partnerships,
where possible. EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which promote the effective
use of partnerships between organizations. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
partnerships
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to forming a collaborative working relationship between two or more organizations such as governmental agencies,
non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and/or the private sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reference to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
type of environmental issue,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under Section VI.V.4. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicant to submit proposals which use pollution prevention
concepts or techniques to address a high priority environmental issue (as discussed under Section IV.N.1.c.). EPA
hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which convey the importance of pollution
prevention. The term pollution prevention refers to reducing or eliminating waste or pollution at the source. It
means not creating waste or pollution in the first place, instead of deciding how to recycle, treat, or dispose of waste
and pollution that has already been created. Pollution prevention may include increasing energy efficiency and
resource conservation efforts, as well as finding non-polluting substitutes for existing products and activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution prevention is not the only strategy that EPA uses to reduce risk to public health and the environment, but
it is EPA's preferred approach. Efforts to promote pollution prevention through environmental education may include
projects that educate the public about the value of preventive approaches to environmental problems and the choices
they can make in their everyday lives to minimize adverse effects of human activities on the environment (e.g., in
the home, work place, market place, and/or community).

EPA Regional Administrators will select grant recipients for projects with federal environmental education grant
funding of $25,000 or less, taking into account the recommendations of the regional environmental education coordinators
who will base their recommendations on the factors discussed above. The Associate Administrator for Communications,
Education, and Public Affairs at EPA headquarters will select the grant recipients for projects with federal environmental
education grant funding of more than $25,000 and up to $250,000, taking into account the recommendations of the Environmental
Education Division Director who will base the recommendations on the factors discussed above.

W. How and when will I be notified about the status of my proposal?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Headquarters and each regional office set up their own processes for notifying applicants about the status of their
proposals. Our goal is to keep applicants informed as much as possible about the status of their proposals and to assist
those applicants who do not receive funding to successfully compete in future years. To this end, all applicants will
be notified (in mid-December 1994) after their pre-applications have been received and entered into a computerized
data base, and again (in late April to early May 1995) after awards have been announced. To the extent possible, EPA
will also provide applicants with feedback on those proposals which were screened out of the process early and on how
proposals were evaluated. The degree to which EPA can provide such feedback will vary among EPA offices depending
upon the availability of resources to conduct these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
X. Where may I obtain more information on possible sources of funding other than this program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of pre-applications EPA received in Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and 1994 demonstrates the strong demand
for funding environmental education projects. EPA expects an equally large demand for funding for Fiscal Year 1995.
Unfortunately, EPA alone cannot meet this demand. Thus, in cooperation with EPA, the North American Association
for Environmental Education (NAAEE) has developed a publication called ``Grant Funding For Your Environmental
Education Program'' which provides strategies for identifying potential sources of funding. This publication
can be purchased for a $5.00 fee by writing to NAAEE, Publications and Member Services, P.O. Box 400, Troy, Ohio, 45373.

Y. When can I begin incurring costs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant recipients may begin incurring costs on the start date that is identified in your grant agreement with EPA. Since
EPA plans to announce awards in the Spring of 1995, EPA recommends that you do not plan to begin incurring costs until
June of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Z. When must proposed activities be completed?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA strongly encourages grant recipients to complete their projects within the time period specified in the pre-application.
Extensions may be granted only in extenuating circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
AA. May an applicant request Fiscal Year 1995 funds for a project that extends beyond a one-year budget period?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pre-applications submitted to EPA regional offices for up to $5,000 may request funds for only a one-year budget period.
Pre-applications submitted to EPA regional offices or headquarters requesting funds of more than $5,000 may request
funds for up to a two-year budget period, although EPA strongly encourages applicants to request funds for only a one-year
budget period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires that projects be performed by the applicant or by a person satisfactory to the applicant and EPA. All
pre-applications must identify any person other than the applicant that will assist in carrying out the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
CC. What reports and work products must grant recipients submit to EPA and when are they due?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All grant recipients must submit three copies of their final report and three copies of all work products to the EPA
project officer within 30 days after the expiration of the budget period. This report will be accepted as the final
report unless the EPA project officer notifies you, within 30 days of your submittal date, that changes must be made.
Grant recipients with projects that have a two-year budget period must also submit a progress report at the end of the
first year. Grant recipients with a federal environmental education grant share greater than $5,000 may also be required
to submit a quarterly or semi-annual progress report. Specific report requirements will be identified in your award
agreement with EPA.

Part I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title III of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984, (Pub. L. 98&hyph;457, 42 U.S.C. 10401, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is entitled the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (the Act). It was first implemented in FY 1986 and reauthorized
and amended for fiscal years 1993 through 1995 by Congress on May 28, 1992 by Public Law 102&hyph;295. Funds under the
Act are awarded to States and Indian Tribes to assist in supporting programs and projects to prevent incidents of family
violence and to provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of family violence and their dependents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Family violence prevention funds have served to supplement many already established community-based family violence
prevention and service activities. These funds also have allowed States and Tribes to expand current service programs
and establish additional new centers in rural and underserved areas, on Native American Reservations, and in Alaskan
Native Villages and Regional Corporation areas. In most areas, there is private sector as well as State and local funding
for these emergency shelters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, has provided technical assistance grants
to several State Coalitions Against Domestic Violence, and to several nonprofit organizations to assist shelter
operators and service providers to improve their service delivery, and also to support better planning, coordination
and information exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the grants that were initially made available in FY 1986, the Department also has supported: The operation
of the Clearinghouse on Family Violence Information; research activities with the Department of Justice; regionally
based training and technical assistance for State and local law enforcement personnel through the Department of
Justice; and grants for technical assistance and training for State and local public and private nonprofit agencies
administering the family violence program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During FY 1993, the Department continued to make grant awards that enhanced public information and community awareness
strategies and activities. Twenty-one grant awards for public information and community awareness were made during
FY 1993 to private non-profit organizations representing Native Americans, Haitian Americans, Asian Americans,
and community coalitions. These grant awards provided support to various organizations in their efforts to prevent
family violence and to make their communities aware of the nature and prevalence of domestic violence as well as the
services available for prevention activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six grant awards were made during FY 1993 to demonstrate model training for domestic violence prosecutors that would
provide improved access and legal representation for domestic violence victims. A national resource center for
domestic violence and three special issue resource centers also were established during FY 1993. The national resource
center and the special-issue resource centers will provide resource and service information, training, and technical
assistance to Federal, State, and Indian tribal agencies, as well as to local domestic violence programs and to professionals
and other individuals who provide services to victims of domestic violence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible Applicants:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 State and local agencies, Territories, and Native American Tribes and Tribal Organizations who are, or have been,
recipients of Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grants; State and local private non-profit agencies experienced
in the field of family violence prevention; and public and private non-profit educational institutions, community
organizations and community-based coalitions, and other entities that have designed and implemented family violence
prevention information activities or community awareness strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on the encouraging response to the announcement for public information and community awareness grants for
family violence prevention in Federal fiscal years 1992 and 1993, ACF plans to again make these grants available in
FY 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public information/community awareness grant awards have spawned very effective informational activities
at the local levels. These grants have assisted community organizations to focus on and emphasize prevention, helped
to make available public service announcements and legal brochures in several different languages, including Russian
and Vietnamese, and have assisted in the implementation of conflict resolution activities in elementary, middle
and high school curricula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of this priority area is to continue to add credible and persuasive information to the arsenal of weapons necessary
and available to community organizations to help break the so-called ``cycle of family violence.'' The continuation
of these efforts will help assure that individuals, particularly within minority communities, are aware of available
resources and alternative responses for the resolution and the prevention of violence. The proposed grant awards
will provide support for a model that provides for a more informed individual and thus, more effective prevention
strategies on the part of that individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of this priority area requires the development and implementation of an innovative public information
campaign model that may be used, for example, by public and private agencies, schools, churches, boys and girls clubs,
community organizations, and individuals. The ACF support for the continued increase of information on services
and other alternatives for the prevention of family violence promotes the concepts that this behavior is unacceptable
and that victims, their dependents, and perpetrators need to be provided with remedial and service options for their
particular situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accurate information is critical to any community awareness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategy and activity. How information is communicated must be modified where communication barriers may exist
because of perceived or real language differences and cultural insensitivities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist in the development of public information materials, educational strategies, and community activities
for families that will focus on family violence prevention as a part of a comprehensive approach to improve and enable
family-focused interventions. It is expected that these interventions which are directed towards families will
increase the awareness of violence and decrease its incidence and impact in minority communities. In these efforts
the responding institutions should enlist the energy and cooperation of significant community institutions, community
organizations, and individuals to serve as models and to provide information on resources, services, facilities,
and alternatives to violence in the family.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Community Services, Administration for Children and Families invites Historically Black Universities
and Colleges to submit applications for projects that will provide for the development, implementation and operation
of comprehensive family violence prevention strategies and for the dissemination of informational and resource
materials for the prevention of family violence in our minority communities. Successful applicants for this priority
area will not be precluded from applying in response to a subsequent announcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of this priority area is to provide support for the inclusion of ``family violence prevention'' in a comprehensive
approach which considers environmental and cultural factors in plans for intervention and violence prevention
strategies in minority communities. Historical Black Colleges and Universities in their relationships with minority
communities and their residents offer an opportunity for the exchange and development of innovative ideas and approaches
to the prevention of violence in general. This effort will make it possible to capture, consider and utilize the ideas
for violence prevention that exist in the minority communities, particularly in response to the problems of racism
and poverty. The utilization of HBCUs in this effort will make available the considerable expertise, experience,
and resources to be found in these institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Family violence prevention activities encompass a wide range of activities that include the teaching of conflict
resolution skills, the implementation of intervention strategies, and the development of informational materials
on available resources and services. Family violence prevention may be viewed as the sum of activities which are guides
to acceptable behavior. For example, activities that may be a part of the family violence prevention equation provide
parenting skills and techniques, emphasize self-esteem for our youth, stress the importance of higher education
as a conduit to a better lifestyle, and identify the means of avoiding negative health consequences such as AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Family violence prevention needs to be considered as a part of an overall violence prevention strategy. With this
particular perspective the Administration for Children and Families is interested in applications that address:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall strategies for violence prevention activities that focus on educational and training efforts, outreach
activities and supportive services, and the role and impact of community institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooperative networks and collaborative approaches within the minority communities for the prevention of anti-social
and violent behavior and that facilitate the implementation of family violence preventive efforts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intervention approaches concerned with building upon family values within minority families; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutional intervention strategies utilizing resources such as alumni, fraternities and sororities, the African
American religious community, and volunteers from the community in general; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The identification of data gathering, informational and research activities that are needed to identify, support,
and implement the long-term strategic interventions to reduce ``Black on Black'' crime in general and family violence
in the African American community in particular.

Act grants; private nonprofit child welfare agencies; domestic violence advocacy organizations; and domestic
violence State coalitions. Applicants must submit a signed Letter of Agreement between the public agency representing
the child welfare/child protection responsibilities and the organization or coalition representing domestic
violence advocacy organizations and their concerns. Either signatory to the Agreement may be the principal grantee.
The Agreement to be submitted will specifically indicate the role each participant organization has in the implementation
of the proposed project. Because the successful implementation of a proposed project would have implications for
systemic/procedural change in the child welfare and/or the domestic violence community, the Letter of Agreement
is mandatory.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To develop effective strategies for domestic violence services integration into child protection systems and strategies.
To offer the applicant organizations an opportunity to design, develop, and collaborate on one of several issues
or areas of concern between the child protection system and the domestic violence community. Efforts are to be focused
on the development of curricula and materials and the implementation of training to be available. The training of
child protection representatives and domestic violence advocates will be to enable the most efficient and effective
response when encountering woman abuse in the course of child abuse and neglect investigations. Protocols for effective
strategies of intervention need to be designed, developed and put in place to allow for the child protection system
to assist and utilize the non-offending parent to protect her children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may propose to do one or more of the following: Plan and implement the training of child protection service
workers, supervisors and social services providers on the relationship of domestic violence and child abuse and
neglect; develop and implement domestic violence responsive policies to be adopted by the Statewide child protection
services system; develop and implement through the child protection system a domestic violence specific curriculum
which will become part of a mandatory training program; develop and implement Memoranda of Understanding between
the child protection system and the domestic violence statewide system; and gather and submit data correlating abuse
between adult partners and child abuse and neglect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a recent review of the literature, it has become evident that in the homes where the woman is battered the children
were themselves more likely to be victims of child abuse and neglect. Domestic violence is surfacing as one of the highest
risks to children. Domestic violence represents physical endangerment to the child as well as the possibility for
developmental delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1985, there were an estimated 795,000 abused children between the ages of 3 and 17 living in two-parent households
(Gelles, Strauss, 1987). According to these studies, men are the main perpetrators of domestic violence and commit
95 percent of all assaults on women. In 70 percent of households in which women are abused, the men also commit child
abuse (Schecter, 1982). Also, in 70 percent of child abuse cases treated at Boston Children's Hospital in 1991, the
mother was abused as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an attempt to establish the actual relationship between child abuse and battering in families, 116 mothers of children
``darted'' or flagged in a single year for abuse or neglect at a metropolitan hospital were studied by Stark and Flitcraft
(1984). These examinations revealed that 45 percent of the abused children had mothers who themselves were being
physically abused and another 5 percent had mothers whose relationships were ``full of conflict,'' although abuse
was not verified. Bowker, Arbitell and McFerron (1988) reported that children whose mothers had been battered were
more likely to be physically abused and less likely to be ``neglected'' than children whose mothers had not been battered.
In Hilberman and Munson's (1987) research, they found evidence of physical and/or sexual abuse of children in 20 of
the 60 cases they studied. They concluded: ``There seems to be two styles of abuse: the husband beats the wife who beats
the children, and/or the husband beats both his wife and children.''

Part III_The Review Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine that the applicant organization
is an eligible applicant as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do
not meet the eligibility requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition,
and the applicant will be so informed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each priority area description contains information about the types of agencies and organizations which are eligible
to apply under that priority area. Since eligibility varies among priority areas, it is critical that the ``Eligible
Applicants'' section under each specific priority area be read carefully. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only agencies and organizations, not individuals, are eligible to apply under any of the priority areas. On all applications
developed jointly by more than one agency or organization, the applications must identify only one organization
as the lead organization and official applicant. The other participating agencies and organizations can be included
as co-participants, subgrantees or subcontractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any non-profit agency which has not previously received an award from the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services
must submit proof of non-profit status with its grant application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-profit agency can accomplish this by either making reference to its listing in the Internal Revenue Service's
(IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations or submitting a copy of its letter from the IRS under IRS Code Section
501(c)(3). ACF cannot fund a non-profit applicant without acceptable proof of its non-profit status.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timely applications will be reviewed and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally persons from outside
of the Federal government, will use the appropriate evaluation criteria listed later in this Part to review and score
the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCS reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding
sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit
comments from ACF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations,
specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will
be considered by OCS in making funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making decisions on awards, OCS may give preference to applications which focus on or feature: Minority populations;
a substantially innovative strategy with the potential to improve theory or practice in the field of human services;
a model practice or set of procedures that holds the potential for replication by organizations involved in the administration
or delivery of human services; substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial involvement (either financial
or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available for
the proposed project; the potential for high benefit for low Federal investment; a programmatic focus on those most

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution of
assistance among the States and geographical regions of the country, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations.
In making these decisions, OCS may also take into account the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.

C. Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the appropriate evaluation criteria below, a panel of at least three reviewers (primarily experts from outside
the Federal government) will review each application. Applicants should ensure that they address each minimum requirement
in the priority area description under the appropriate section of the Program Narrative Statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reviewers will determine the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal in terms of the appropriate evaluation criteria
listed below, provide comments and assign numerical scores. The point value following each criterion heading indicates
the maximum numerical weight that each section may be given in the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Review Criteria for All Priority Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications under all priority areas will be evaluated against the following criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objectives and Need for the Project (20 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State the specific objectives and needs addressed by the project in terms of its national or regional significance,
its theoretical importance, its applicability to policy and practice. Provide a detailed discussion of the ``state-of-the-art''
relative to the problem or area addressed by the proposal and indicate how the proposed effort will impact on it. State
the goals or service objectives of the proposal. Provide supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned
interests other than the applicant. Summarize, evaluate and relate relevant data, based on planning or demonstration
studies to the proposed project. The application must identify the specific topics or program areas to be served by
the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Results or Benefits Expected (20 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The extent to which the application identifies the results and benefits to be derived, the extent to which they are
consistent with the objectives of the proposal, the extent to which the application indicates the anticipated contributions
to policy, practice, and theory, and the extent to which the proposed project costs are reasonable in view of the expected
results. Identify, in specific terms, the results and benefits, for target groups and human service providers, to
be derived from implementing the proposed project. Describe how the expected results and benefits will relate to
previous demonstration efforts. Describe in detail evaluation plans and procedures which are capable of measuring
the degree to which the project objectives have been accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approach (35 points). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The extent to which the application outlines a sound and workable plan of action pertaining to the scope of the project,
and details how the proposed work will be accomplished; relates each task to the objectives and identifies the key
staff member who will be the lead person; provides a chart indicating the timetable for completing each task, the lead
person, and the time committed; cites factors which might accelerate or decelerate the work, giving acceptable reasons
for taking this approach as opposed to others; describes and supports any unusual features of the project, such as
design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary social and community involvements;
and provides for projections of the accomplishments to be achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extent to which, when applicable, the application describes the evaluation methodology that will be used to determine
if the needs identified and discussed are being met and if the results and benefits identified are being achieved.
The application also lists each organization, agency, consultant, or other key individuals or groups who will work
on the project, along with a description of the activities and nature of their effort or contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level of Effort: (25 Points). Staffing pattern
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Describe the staffing pattern for the proposed project, clearly linking responsibilities to project tasks and
specifying the contributions to be made by key staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Competence of staff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Describe the qualifications of the project team including any experiences working on similar projects. Also, describe
the variety of skills to be used, relevant educational background and the demonstrated ability to produce final results
that are comprehensible and usable. One or two pertinent paragraphs on each key member are preferred to vitae/r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.
However, vita/r&eacute;sum&eacute;s may be included in the ten pages allowed for attachments/appendices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adequacy of resources
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Specify the adequacy of the available facilities, resources and organizational experience with regard to the tasks
of the proposed project. List the financial, physical and other sources to be provided by other profit and nonprofit
organizations. Explain how these organizations will participate in the day to day operations of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Budget
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Relate the proposed budget to the level of effort required to obtain project objectives and provide a cost/benefit
analysis. Demonstrate that the project's costs are reasonable in view of the anticipated results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collaborative efforts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Discuss in detail and provide documentation for any collaborative or coordinated efforts with other agencies or
organizations. Identify these agencies or organizations and explain how their participation will enhance the project.
Letters from these agencies and organizations discussing the specifics of their commitment must be included in the
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Authorship
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The authors of the application must be clearly identified together with their current relationship to the applicant
organization and any future project role they may have if the project is funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should note that non-responsiveness to the section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Minimum Requirements for Project Design'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will result in a low evaluation score by the panel of expert reviewers. Applicants must clearly identify the specific
priority area under which they wish to have their applications considered, and tailor their applications accordingly.
Previous experience has shown that an application which is broader and more general in concept than outlined in the
priority area description is less likely to score as well as one which is more clearly focused on and directly responsive
to the concerns of that specific priority area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Available Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OCS intends to award grants resulting from this announcement during the fourth quarter of FY 1994. The size of the actual
awards will vary. Each priority area description includes information on the maximum Federal share of the project
costs and the anticipated number of projects to be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``project period'' refers to the total time a project is approved for support, including any extensions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where appropriate, applicants may propose project periods which are shorter than the maximums specified in the various
priority areas. Non-Federal share contributions may exceed the minimums specified in the various priority areas
when the applicant is able to do so.

E. Grantee Share of Project Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal funds will be provided to cover up to 75% of the total allowable project costs. Therefore, the non-Federal
share must amount to at least 25% of the total (Federal plus non-Federal) project cost. This means that, for every $3
in Federal funds received, up to the maximum amount allowable under each priority area, applicants must contribute
at least $1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the cost breakout for a project with a total cost of $56,666 to implement would be:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Part contains information and instructions for submitting applications in response to this announcement.
Application forms are provided as part of this publication along with a checklist for assembling an application package.
Please copy and use these forms in submitting an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential applicants should read this section carefully in conjunction with the information contained within the
specific priority area under which the application is to be submitted. The priority area descriptions are in part
II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Required Notification of the State Single Point of Contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, (E.O.) ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,''
and 45 CFR part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Program and Activities.''
Under the E.O., States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau,
have elected to participate in the E.O. process and have established a Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these eighteen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants
should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that OCS can obtain
and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials,
if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the
Standard Form 424, item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to differentiate clearly between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor,
Washington, DC 20447. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included at the end of this announcement.

approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local and State governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements.
When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be charged
again as direct costs to the grant. In the case of training grants to other than State or local governments (as defined
in title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, part 74), the Federal reimbursement of indirect costs will be limited to
the lesser of the negotiated (or actual) indirect cost rate or 8 percent of the amount allowed for direct costs, exclusive
of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items,
and alterations and renovations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For training grant applications, the entry under line 6j should be the total indirect costs being charged to the project.
The Federal share of indirect costs is calculated as shown above. The applicant's share is calculated as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Calculate total project indirect costs (a*) by applying the applicant's approved indirect cost rate to the total
project (Federal and non-Federal) direct costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statutory Provisions and Legislative History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part D of the Act (IDEA) provides support for programs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the quantity and improve the quality of personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained to provide early intervention, education, and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services to infants, toddlers, children, youth, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families. The Division of Personnel Preparation (DPP) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), Office of Special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), administers this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As amended in 1990 through 1992, section 634(a) (1) and (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of IDEA requires personnel training grantees funded under 631(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to report the number of personnel enrolled under each grant by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category of training and level of training; and the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals trained receiving degrees and certification, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category and level of training. The law further requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants for training grants must provide a description of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed strategies to recruit and train members of minority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups and persons with disabilities, as well as to give them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority consideration for stipend support when selecting among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified trainees. See section 631(a)(2)(B) and (3) of IDEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, trainees' race or ethnicity, and their disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status were added to the Personnel Data Form, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information required by Section 634. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Under section 631(e)(11), as amended in 1990 through 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grantees who are parent training and information centers must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report detailed information on their clients served. OSEP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed a separate Parent Data Form to capture these data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Both forms were provisionally approved for one year by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on November 12, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Data Elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist the Department of Education in monitoring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficacy of this training program in meeting the educational and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related needs of infants, children, youth, and their families, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to examine how grantees are implementing statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, the Department intends to add further data elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Personnel Data Form, as well as to the Parent Data Form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The planned revision of the Personnel Data Form would add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III, which would include individual counts for student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trainee outcomes data on: (1) Completers (such as length of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the degree) and (2) noncompleters (such as reasons for not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing); and aggregate counts for placement outcomes (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of employment and geographic location). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The revised Parent Data Form would include data on the names 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of organizations networked or consulted with under IDEA section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
631(e)(11) (E) and (F).
