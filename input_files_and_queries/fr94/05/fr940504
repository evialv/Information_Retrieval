 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its farm tract appraisal regulations in order to implement and conform
to the provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989. The intended
effect of this rule is to meet the provisions of title XI of FIRREA and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practice (USPAP) as directed from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Bulletin A&hyph;129).

We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: (1)
Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an
action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations or recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Discussion of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 25, 1993, FmHA published an interim rule which removed 7 CFR part 1809, subpart A, ``Appraisal of Farms and
Leasehold Interests,'' from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It also did the following: (1) Revised and renumbered part 1809 to FmHA Instruction 1922, subpart E_``Appraisal
of Farms and Leasehold Interests.''; (2) Issued revised &sect;1922.201 ``General'' (old &sect;1809.1 ``General'')
and (3) Issued new &sect;1922.209 ``Easements and appraising property subject to easements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other &sect;&sect;1809.2 through 1809.8 of subpart A were amended to meet USPAP and placed in &sect;&sect;1922.202
through 1922.208 of FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;E. Sections 1922.202 through 1922.208 were not published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because they involve internal Agency management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes were implemented upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to provide immediate guidance to FmHA designated farm real estate appraisers and FmHA contract farm real
estate appraisers concerning the use of the uniform standards as set out in Sections I, II and III of USPAP. This action
was necessary because most States enacted legislation and implemented FIRREA on January 1, 1993, and required farm
real estate appraisers to follow uniform appraisal standards or Sections I, II and III of USPAP. Further delays by
FmHA would have had an adverse impact on FmHA borrowers and loan applicants due to delays which may have resulted from
the continued use of outdated farm appraisal techniques and methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period ended September 24, 1993. No comments were received. Accordingly, no substantive change is made
from the interim rule. Minor editorial changes of an administrative nature have been made. Inadvertently, a few FmHA
Instructions were overlooked when revising references from FmHA Instruction 422.1 to FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subpart A of the Board's Regulation J (12 CFR part 210) governs the collection of checks and other items by Federal Reserve
Banks. Regulation J sets out the warranties made by institutions that send items for collection through the Federal
Reserve System as well as warranties made by Reserve Banks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulation J also covers liability for breach of warranty, presentment of and settlement for cash items and returned
checks, and other related issues.

As used in this docket, sender means any institution that sends a check to a Reserve Bank for collection, and bank includes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In October 1992, the Board published amendments to its Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) that require paying banks to
make same-day settlement for certain checks presented by private-sector banks, effective January 3, 1994 (57 FR
46956, October 14, 1992). As part of these amendments, the Board revised the Regulation CC warranties to require private-sector
collecting, returning, and presenting banks to warrant the accuracy of cash letter totals and check encoding. In
December 1993, the Board published proposed amendments to Regulation J to clarify that the Reserve Banks and institutions
that send items to Reserve Banks also make the Regulation CC warranties, to conform certain Regulation J provisions
to the 1990 version of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), and to make other minor changes (58 FR 68566, December
28, 1993). The Board received 10 comments on the proposed amendments, which are discussed in the section-by-section
analysis below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Board has established procedures for assessing the competitive impact of changes that have a substantial effect
on payments system participants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under these procedures, the Board assesses whether the proposed regulatory changes would have a direct and material
adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve Banks in
providing similar services due to differing legal powers or constraints or due to a dominant market position of the
Federal Reserve deriving from such legal differences. The Regulation J amendments are largely technical, clarifying,
or conform Regulation J to the rules applicable to private-sector banks under Regulation CC and the U.C.C. The Board
believes that the amendments would not have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of others to compete
effectively with the Federal Reserve Banks.

This section sets forth the authority, purpose, and scope of subpart A of Regulation J. At the suggestion of one commenter,
the Board is updating the authority citations in this section to conform with the authority citations in the CFR. Specifically,
the Board has added a citation to section 11(j) of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorizes the Board to exercise general
supervision over the Reserve Banks.

The Board proposed to amend the definition of ``item'' in keeping with the definition of ``item'' in U.C.C. &sect;4&hyph;104(a)(9).
Under the amended language, ``item'' would expressly include promises or orders, such as certain bonds or other investment
securities, that are handled through the bank collection system. The Board received no comments on this section and
has adopted the amendment as proposed.

The Board proposed to amend this section to set forth more accurately the scope of the Federal Reserve Banks' operating
circulars, which include provisions for service terms and adjustments. The amendment specifies that the operating
circulars may include provisions for adjustments of amounts, waiver of expenses, and payment of interest by as-of
adjustment.

One commenter believed that the proposed change, at least as it relates to Reserve Bank adjustment practices, impedes
the ability of correspondent banks to compete with the Reserve Banks. This commenter stated that the adjustment accounting
practices of its local Reserve Bank require intercept processors and depository institutions to engage in a burdensome
reconcilement process. The commenter stated that the Board should not incorporate the operating circulars into
Regulation J. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments, however, would not incorporate the operating circulars into Regulation J, but rather would
provide greater detail as to the scope of the operating circulars. Issues related to adjustment posting alternatives
generally can be settled between the Reserve Bank and the parties involved and would not be affected by the proposed
amendment to Regulation J. Thus, the Board has adopted the amendment as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to add a new paragraph to &sect;210.3 to clarify that Regulation J supersedes the U.C.C., other
state laws, and Regulation CC to the extent of any inconsistency. This provision parallels &sect;229.41 of Regulation
CC, which provides that Regulation CC supersedes the U.C.C. and other state law to the extent of the inconsistency.
The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.5(a) to conform the warranties made by banks that send items to Reserve Banks
to the transfer and presentment warranties in U.C.C. 4&hyph;207 and 4&hyph;208. A sender would warrant that it was
(or acted on behalf of a person who was) entitled to enforce the item. The U.C.C. substituted the concept of ``person
entitled to enforce'' for ``person with good title'' in recognition that the right to enforce an instrument is not
limited to holders. In addition, the proposed amendment would require the sender to warrant that the item was not altered,
dropping the adverb ``materially.'' The U.C.C. formerly incorporated the concept of a ``material'' alteration
as one that changed the contract of the parties in any respect. The revised U.C.C. refers to such a change simply as an
alteration. Finally, the proposed amendment would clarify that the sender also makes the warranties set forth in
Regulation CC and that the Regulation J warranties may not be disclaimed and are made regardless of whether the sender's
indorsement appears on the item. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned that dropping the word ``materially'' would mean that repair of MICR encoding on a check
that rejects from automated processing would constitute an alteration. Section 3&hyph;407 of the U.C.C. defines
``alteration'' as an unauthorized change that purports to modify the obligation of a party or an unauthorized addition
of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party. The 1990 version
of the U.C.C. appears to use the terms ``alteration'' synonymously with the former term ``material alteration''
(see Official Comment (1) to U.C.C. 3&hyph;407). MICR repair, which is intended to facilitate check collection and
not to affect the obligations of the parties to a check, is unlikely to be considered an alteration.

Sections 210.5(d) and 210.12(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to add new paragraph (d) to &sect;210.5 and new paragraph (i) to &sect;210.12 to give a Reserve Bank
a security interest in a sender's or prior collecting or returning bank's assets held by the Reserve Bank. The security
interest would attach when a warranty is breached or other obligation is incurred. The proposed provisions were based
on similar provisions in subpart B of Regulation J, which gives a Reserve Bank a security interest in the assets of a
sender of a payment order to secure overdrafts and other obligations (&sect;210.28(b) (3) and (4)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters were concerned that the proposal would give Reserve Banks greater rights than private-sector banks
to resolve warranty breach issues. One of the commenters stated that the proposal appeared to give Reserve Banks a
complete self-remedy for breaches absent a court order or agreement of the parties. The commenter noted that security
interests under &sect;210.28 are designed to secure overdrafts, which are easily determinable, as opposed to warranty
breaches, which are often a matter of dispute. The commenter requested that the proposal be clarified to provide that
security interests do not attach and a Reserve Bank may not set off or realize upon collateral without a judicial determination
or agreement of the parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9&hyph;501(5) of the U.C.C. provides that when a claim of a secured party is reduced to judgment, the secured
party's lien on collateral relates back to the date the security interest was perfected. Accordingly, the Board believes
that a Reserve Bank's security interest in the assets of a warranting bank should attach on the date the warranty is
breached (generally the date the Reserve Bank handles the check in question) so that the Reserve Bank may take actions
to protect its collateral, if necessary, as discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Monetary Control Act of 1980 (12 U.S.C. 248a) directed the Board and the Reserve Banks to establish and set prices
for services with due consideration to ensuring an adequate level of services nationwide. In keeping with this directive,
the Board expects that Reserve Banks will provide check collection services to financially troubled banks that cannot
obtain services elsewhere. If a troubled bank fails, the Reserve Bank may be liable on warranty claims that it cannot
pass back to the failed bank. Accordingly, the Board believes that it is appropriate to provide some protection to
the Reserve Banks from pending insolvencies. Thus, the Board has adopted the proposed security interest provisions,
with modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications to &sect;&sect;229.5(d) and 229.12(i) clarify when a default occurs. Specifically, a Reserve
Bank's rights to take any action under those sections will apply only: (1) If the Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion,
deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender or (2) at the time the sender suspends payments and is closed.
The Board believes that requiring the Reserve Bank to advise a bank of its concerns about the bank's solvency will prevent
the routine use of set-off or other actions on collateral by Reserve Banks. The Board believes that private-sector
banks often reserve the right under security agreements to take steps, such as placing a hold on collateral, to protect
themselves in cases where the banks consider themselves insecure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, when a Reserve Bank receives notice of a warranty claim based on alleged forged indorsement or
alteration, it would pass the notice back to the bank from which it received the check. The Reserve Bank would not, however,
unilaterally pass judgment on such a claim. Rather, the Reserve Banks' uniform operating circulars provide that
they will process adjustments for these types of warranty claims only with the agreement of the prior collecting bank.
If such agreement is not forthcoming, the Reserve Bank would wait to be sued on the warranty claim and would tender defense
of the suit to the prior collecting bank under &sect;&sect;210.5 (b) and (c) and 210.12 (e) and (f) of Regulation J.
Entries would be made or collateral disposed of only after judgment as provided in those sections. The amendments
to &sect;&sect;229.5(d) and 229.12(i), however, would not require a sender bank to fail or a Reserve Bank to deem itself
insecure before the Reserve Bank could make credit or debit adjustments to reserve or clearing accounts in accordance
with adjustment procedures established in Reserve Bank operating circulars.

Section 210.6(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.6(b) to conform the Reserve Bank warranties to the transfer and presentment
warranties in U.C.C. 4&hyph;207 and 4&hyph;208. (See discussion of &sect;210.5(a).) The amendment clarifies that
the Reserve Banks make the warranties set out in &sect;229.34 of Regulation CC. The Board received no comments on this
section and has adopted the amendment as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 210.6(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210.6(c) provides a 2-year statute of limitations for claims against Reserve Banks for lack of good faith
or failure to exercise ordinary care under Regulation J. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that the
Regulation CC limitation period of one year would apply to any claims against a Reserve Bank under Regulation CC, such
as breach of a warranty under &sect;229.34 or lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care under &sect;229.38.
This amendment clarifies that claims against Reserve Banks for Regulation CC violations are subject to the same time
limitations as those against private-sector banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board received three comments on this section. Two commenters believed that limitation period for breach of Regulation
CC warranties should be two years rather than one year. One of these commenters often receives adjustment requests
from the IRS one to two years after the fact and does not wish to be precluded from pursuing such adjustments with a Reserve
Bank. This commenter suggested that the Regulation CC limitation period be extended to 2 years. Another commenter
noted that, if the one year limitation period is adopted, it should run from the date of the last entry for the check in
question rather than from the date the check first cleared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the same limitation period should apply to Reserve Banks and private-sector banks for Regulation
CC violations. As Regulation CC provides a one-year statute of limitations, the Board does not believe Regulation
J should lengthen this period for Reserve Banks and has adopted the proposed amendment. The one-year period was established
in subpart C of Regulation CC to match the one-year limitation period for subpart B (funds availability) violations,
which was set by statute. As provided in Regulation CC &sect;229.38(g), an action must be brought within one year after
the date of the occurrence of the violation involved.

Section 210.9(a)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210.9(a)(5) provides that paying banks must settle for checks presented by Reserve Banks by ``autocharge''
(i.e. a debit to an account at a Reserve Bank), cash, or other means agreed to by the Reserve Bank. The Board proposed
to amend this section to clarify that a Reserve Bank may, in its discretion, elect to obtain settlement by autocharging
the account of the paying bank for the amount of a cash letter. Virtually all Reserve Bank presentments are settled
via autocharge. This amendment would restate the autocharge provisions that currently are set out in the Reserve
Banks' uniform cash item operating circular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also proposed to amend this section to provide that paying banks that receive presentment from Reserve Banks
may not set off other claims against the amount of settlement owed to the Reserve Bank. Paying banks may set off against
private-sector presenting banks under &sect;229.34(c)(4) of Regulation CC. The Regulation CC set-off provision
was designed to protect paying banks under the same-day settlement rule, which requires paying banks to accept presentment
from and settle with all presenting banks, some of which may be in poor financial condition. If a paying bank overpays
a cash letter in reliance on a cash letter total or check encoding warranted by the presenting bank, it could face the
risk that the presenting bank would be unable to settle for adjustments. Protection against insolvency risk would
not be necessary against a Reserve Bank. In addition, as banks generally settle with Reserve Banks via autocharge,
set-off against a Reserve Bank would be impractical. Therefore, the Board does not believe this amendment would have
a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of private-sector banks to compete effectively with Reserve Banks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210.12(a) provides that a paying bank that has settled for a check presented by a Reserve Bank may return the
check in accordance with Regulation CC, the U.C.C., and the Reserve Bank's operating circular. The Board proposed
to amend this section to clarify that the paying bank may also return a check prior to settlement in accordance with
&sect;210.9(a) of Regulation J and the Reserve Bank's operating circular. This amendment would clarify that a paying
bank would have the same return rights under Regulation J as under Regulation CC and the U.C.C. The Board received no
comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.

Section 210.12(c) sets out the warranties and agreements made by a bank that sends a returned check to a Reserve Bank.
The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that, in addition to the warranties set forth in &sect;229.34 of
Regulation CC, the sender also makes any applicable warranty under state law. For example, the amendment would clarify
that a depositary bank that settled for a returned check could recover the amount paid plus expenses and lost interest
from a prior bank that breached a transfer warranty, in accordance with U.C.C. 4&hyph;208(d). In addition, similar
to the amendments to &sect;210.5(a), the proposed revisions to this paragraph would clarify that the Regulation
J warranties may not be disclaimed and are made regardless of whether the sender's indorsement appears on the item.
These amendments restate provisions that are already applicable to private-sector banks under Regulation CC and
the U.C.C. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.

The Board proposed to add a new paragraph (d) to &sect;210.12 to clarify that when a Reserve Bank transfers and receives
settlement for a returned check, it makes the warranties set out in &sect;229.34 of Regulation CC. In addition, the
new paragraph would parallel revised &sect;210.6(b) (governing Reserve Bank warranties for cash items) by providing
a limitation of the Reserve Bank's liabilities, other than those allowed for in Regulation J, to the Reserve Bank's
own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care. (The amendments redesignate current &sect;&sect;210.12(d)
through (g) as &sect;&sect;210.12(e) through (h).) The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.C.C. (3&hyph;119) and Regulation CC (&sect;229.34(e)) provide that a bank that receives a tender of defense
may in turn tender defense to a prior bank in the collection or return chain. Unless the prior bank comes in and defends,
it is bound by the determination of fact common to the current litigation and any subsequent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 210.5(b) of Regulation J provides that, when a Reserve Bank tenders defense to a sender as a result of a tender
to it, the Reserve Bank need not be a defendant in the suit in order to recover from the sender any losses that it incurs
because of the judgment, so long as the judgment addresses the fact issue of breach of warranty. The Board adopted this
provision in 1986 in order to reduce litigation and provide a more efficient way of handling forged indorsement cases
(51 FR 21740, June 16, 1986). Due to an oversight, when the Board amended &sect;210.12 to provide a similar rule for
returned checks, the language did not match that of &sect;210.5(b) and could have been interpreted to apply only when
a Reserve Bank is a defendant (53 FR 21983, June 13, 1988). The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.12(e) to conform it
to &sect;210.5(b). (The amendments redesignate current &sect;210.12(d) as &sect;210.12(e) and add a new paragraph
(d) as discussed above.) The Board also proposed to correct a typographical error in &sect;210.5(b). The Board received

This section provides that a depositary bank must settle for returned checks received from a Reserve Bank in the same
manner as it settles for cash items presented by the Reserve Bank. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify
that settlement for returned checks also must be made by the same time as settlement for cash items, as provided in &sect;210.9(a).

Section 210.13(a) authorizes a Reserve Bank that does not receive payment for an item to charge back the account of
the sender, paying bank, or returning bank from which the item was received. The Board proposed to amend this section
to clarify that a Reserve Bank also may charge the account of a prior collecting bank through which the item was received.
This amendment is consistent with &sect;229.35(b) of Regulation CC, which allows a bank that handles a check or returned
check to recover from any prior indorser in the event that the bank does not receive payment for the check from a subsequent
bank in the collection or return chain. In the event of such a recovery by a Reserve Bank, &sect;229.13(a) provides
that no bank or person in the forward collection or return chain would have an interest in any funds in the Reserve Bank's
possession of the bank that failed to pay. The amendment would clarify that, when a Reserve Bank charges back an item,
this limitation of interest applies only when a bank or person seeks payment of the amount of the item out of funds or
property held by the Reserve Bank. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.

notice the institution is closed. The amendment also would clarify that this section applies only to charges to reserve
accounts to settle for items (including returned checks) and does not affect the Reserve Bank's security interest

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 12, 1992, the Board approved several proposals to change certain procedures for obtaining Board approval
of various applications and notices filed under the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Holding Company Act, the Bank Merger
Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and various other statutes. All but one of these changes to the Board's application
and notice review procedures were implemented by the Board at that time. Most of these changes involved revising certain
internal procedures of the Federal Reserve System (System), to improve the efficiency of processing applications
that are reviewed by the Board in conjunction with the Reserve Banks and to reduce the regulatory burden associated
with these application and notice procedures. Two of the changes_eliminating the stock redemption notice requirement
for ``well-capitalized'' bank holding companies, and modifying the Board's delegation rules pertaining to competition
and market concentration_necessitate amendments to certain provisions of, respectively, the Board's Regulation
Y and Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority.

See 57 FR 39641 (September 1, 1992). These changes included establishing certain procedures to limit extension of
the pre-acceptance period for applications; offering prospective applicants the opportunity to submit a pre-filing
notice of intent to file an application; eliminating the stock redemption notice requirement for bank holding companies
that are and, following the redemption would remain, ``well-capitalized'' on a consolidated basis and in generally
satisfactory condition; expanding the authority of Reserve Banks to process all delegable applications without
Board staff review; modifying the Board's delegation rules pertaining to competition and market concentration;
reducing redundant post-acceptance processing of Board action cases; increasing the monitoring of cases requiring
extended processing; and establishing a general consent procedure under section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act for
investments by state member banks in bank premises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In publishing notice of these changes, the Board also invited comment on any additional measures to eliminate or reduce
burden associated with the Board's notice and application procedures. The comments received will be considered
by the Board in its ongoing efforts to streamline and reduce the regulatory burden associated with the Board's notice
and application procedures.

Currently, &sect;225.4(b)(1) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.4(b)(1)) requires a bank holding company to give the Board
prior notice of certain purchases or redemptions of its equity securities:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A bank holding company shall give the Board prior notice before purchasing or redeeming its equity securities, if
the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company
for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 percent or more of the company's
consolidated net worth. For the purposes of this section, ``net consideration'' is the gross consideration paid
by the company for all of its equity securities purchased or redeemed during the period minus the gross consideration
received for all of its equity securities sold during the period other than as part of a new issue.

The Board determined to eliminate this notice requirement for bank holding companies that are and, following the
redemption or purchase, would remain ``well-capitalized'' on a consolidated basis and in generally satisfactory
condition. The Board believes that a bank holding company would qualify for this exception to the notice requirement
if:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The total and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and the leverage capital ratio for the bank holding company,
both before and following the redemption, exceed the thresholds established for ``well-capitalized'' state-member
banks under 12 CFR 208.33(b)(1) as if the bank holding company (on a consolidated basis) were deemed to be a state-member
bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The bank holding company received a composite ``1'' or ``2'' rating at its most recent BOPEC inspection, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The bank holding company is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also determined to revise its delegation rules pertaining to competition and market concentration. If
a party submits an application or notice to the System pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act, Change in Bank Control
Act, Bank Merger Act, or the Bank Service Corporation Act, the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12
CFR 265.1&hyph;265.11), permit the appropriate Reserve Bank to act on such application or notice unless certain
circumstances are present. Specifically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;265.11(c)(11)(v) of the Board's Rules provide that a Reserve Bank is not authorized to approve the following
transactions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) With respect to BHC formations, bank acquisitions or mergers, the proposed transaction involves two or more banking
organizations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) That upon consummation of the proposal, would control over 30 percent of total deposits in banking offices in the
relevant geographic market, or would result in an increase of at least 200 points in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
(HHI) in a highly concentrated market (a market with a post-merger HHI of at least 1800); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Where divestitures designed to address any substantive anticompetitive effects are not effected on or before
consummation of the proposed transaction[.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board determined to revise its Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority to increase the resulting market share
criterion that would require Board consideration of a bank merger or acquisition from 30 percent to 35 percent. In
particular, the Reserve Banks may now act on applications involving two or more banking organizations that, upon
consummation of the proposed transaction, would control 35 percent or less of total deposits in banking offices in
the relevant geographic market. This change would also reflect the Board's practice, in computing market share,
of weighing deposits of thrifts in the subject market at 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this change to the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority, the Board also determined to eliminate
the need for Board approval of applications involving divestitures designed to address anticompetitive effects,
which divestitures are not completed on or before consummation of the proposed transaction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a result, the Federal Reserve Banks may now act on applications involving proposed divestitures to address competitive
concerns, provided the divestitures are undertaken in accordance with the Board's position on the timing of divestitures.

The provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. 553) relating to notice, public participation,
and deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments because the
changes to be effected are either procedural in nature and do not constitute a substantive rule subject to the requirements
of that section, or grant an exemption and reduce regulatory burden. The APA grants specific exemptions from its requirements
relating to notice, public participation and the deferred effective date requirements in these instances (12 U.S.C.
553 (b)(3)(A) and (d)(1)).

This action establishes Class D airspace at El Toro, CA, designated as an extension to a Class C surface area. The floor
was inadvertently lowered from a base of 2,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) down to the surface. This modification raises
the floor between the 10 and 15 mile radius of the Class D airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet MSL. The area will be
depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

History

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 31, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class
D airspace at El Toro, CA (59 FR 8565). The Class D airspace was inadvertenly changed during Airspace Reclassification.
This change restricted aircraft transiting along the shoreline. This action will raise the floor of a portion of the
Class D airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet MSL to allow aircraft to transit along the shoreline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA and there were no objections to the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class D airspace designations for airspace designated as extensions to class C airspace are published in Paragraph
5000b of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation modifies Class D airspace at El Toro, CA, to establish
Class D airspace from 2,500 fee MSL to 4,400 feet MSL for aircraft transiting between the 10 and 15 mile radius of MCAS
El Toro, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body by technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regularly Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend
the Class D airspace for the Grant County Airport, Moses Lake, Washington (59 FR 8567). Interested parties were invited
to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No
comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``control zone,''
and airspace extending upward from the surface with an operating airport traffic control tower is now designated
Class D airspace. Class D airspace designations for airspace extending upward from the surface with an operating
airport traffic control tower are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule
are in North America Datum 83.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Moses Lake, Washington. It
will permit air traffic operations at the Moses Lake Municipal Airport without the requirement for direct radio communications
with the airport traffic control tower at the Grant County Airport by excluding the Moses Lake Municipal Airport from
the Grant County Airport Class D airspace. It improves the efficiency at Moses Lake Municipal Airport without significantly
impacting on the operation at the Grant County Airport operation, and simplifies air traffic control activities
within the Class D airspace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends the Class E airspace at Rifle, CO. Establishment of a new instrument approach procedure requires
additional controlled airspace for the procedure. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993,
has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' The
Class E airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference when the new approach procedures become
effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 18, 1994, the FAA proposed to amended part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend
the Class E airspace for the Rifle Garfield County Airport, Rifle, CO (59 FR 8147). Interested parties were invited
to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No
comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,''
and airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level is now designated as Class E airspace. Class E airspace
designations for airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 83.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace to Rifle, Colorado. It will provide
controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the airport. Amendment of the Class E airspace will
result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation
only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary
to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.
Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
80 Stat. 379, 39 Stat. 277, as amended; and 5 U.S.C. 301, U.S.C. 5114 give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority
of law to adopt a new distinctive paper for use in printing United States currency and other interest-bearing securities
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The changes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Amend section 601.2 to reflect a description of the new threaded distinctive paper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amend section 601.3 to indicate that the distinctive paper currently in use will continue to be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Amend section 601.4 to provide that the existing distinctive paper will continue to be used for printing interest-bearing
securities of the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, BEP published Notice No. 1 (58 FR 59973), proposing to amend the provisions of Distinctive Paper
for United States Currency and Other Securities regulations to reflect the adoption of a new distinctive paper adopted
for use by the Secretary of the Treasury to deter counterfeiting. No comments were received on or before the closing
date of December 13, 1993. Therefore, BEP is adopting the language in the proposed rule, with no modification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this document will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required because the final rule is not expected:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To have secondary, or incidental effects on a substantial number of small entities; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To impose, or otherwise cause a significant increase in the reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance burdens
of a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this document is not a major regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and a regulatory
impact analysis is not required because it will not have any annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; it
will not result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local
government agencies or geographical regions; and it will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,
investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign
based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 9, 1986, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), submitted amendments to the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC) Chapter 3745&hyph;21 to USEPA as proposed revisions to the SIP for Ozone. OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 consists
of emission limitations and control requirements for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The amendments
to OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 involve certain compliance deadlines and source specific exemptions from otherwise
applicable emission limitations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 9, 1986, the OEPA submitted amendments to OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 and supporting data to USEPA as a proposed
revision to the ozone portion of its SIP. OEPA adopted these rules in final form on March 21, 1986. OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21,
entitled, ``Carbon Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related Materials Standards,''
includes Ohio's VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT I and II) regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio's submittal included new VOC regulations for additional source categories not specifically covered by Ohio's
existing rules and a site-specific revision for the Huffy Corporation. These other elements of the April 9, 1986,
submittal are not covered in this document. Today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document also does not address those amendments to the ozone SIP that were previously submitted on March 28, 1983,
to USEPA, and were addressed in a March 6, 1985 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 notice of proposed rulemaking (50 FR 9052) and in a January 18, 1989, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 final rulemaking (54 FR 1934). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations subject to this rulemaking are embodied in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, Definitions; OAC
Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04, Attainment dates and compliance time schedules; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09,
Control of emissions of volatile organic compounds from stationary sources; and OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;10,
Compliance test methods and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA is taking final action to approve these revisions, with the following exceptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. USEPA is disapproving the proposed relaxation for food can end sealing compounds in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (D)(1)(e)
and (D)(2)(e) from 3.7 to 4.4 lbs VOC/gal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. USEPA is disapproving the proposed revision to the exemption, as well as the entire exemption in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e)
for the application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio's high ratio of emulsified to cutback asphalt used in 1987 is not a valid basis for exempting the hand application
of cutback asphalt. This exemption is inconsistent with USEPA guidance, and Ohio has provided no data on the amount
of additional cutback asphalt that would be used in the ozone season as a result of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, USEPA is disapproving the recordkeeping requirements in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(4) because they
are inadequate with respect to the time period during which records are required because paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09
(N)(4) only deals with recordkeeping requirements and not when cutback asphalt is allowed to be used. Ohio's SIP does
not allow cutback asphalt to be used from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 15 through October 15. Unless and until the exemption period is changed (in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(3)),
the recordkeeping requirements must reflect the SIP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. USEPA is disapproving the relaxation from 3.5 to 6.2 lbs. VOC/gal for high performance architectural aluminum
coatings in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii) because Ohio did not document the infeasibility of add-on controls
and powder coatings in support of its proposed relaxation. USEPA will evaluate the merits of a compliance date extension
if submitted and supported by OEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, USEPA will repropose rulemaking on the relaxation for miscellaneous metal parts, in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09
(U)(1)(vii), and USEPA will propose rulemaking on the exemption for new sources, in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(2)(f),

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OEPA proposed a relaxation from 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (lbs VOC/gallon of coating, excluding water)
to 4.4 lbs/gal for food can end sealing compounds. OEPA's basis includes a September 13, 1985, letter and testimony
to OEPA from Heekin Can; an April 13, 1984, submittal from the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) to USEPA; and testimony
presented by Campbell Soup Company before the OEPA on September 12, 1985. The basis of the can industry's requests
for a relaxation is the purported unavailability of complying end sealing compounds for food can ends, as well as the
infeasibility of add-on control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA proposed disapproval of this relaxation because data from a San Diego source (Van Camp) indicates the possible
feasibility of both add-on control equipment and low solvent coatings, and Ohio had not considered this information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Comments on Proposed Disapproval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Heekin Can, Campbell Soup, Central States Company, OEPA, and the Can Manufacturers Institute commented on the proposed
disapproval. Their comments, and USEPA's response to these comments are enumerated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Campbell Soup Company Submitted the Following Comments on July 27, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendment should now be approved by USEPA in total: The data cited by USEPA in the notice of proposed rulemaking
is, on its face, not an appropriate basis for rejection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data cited by USEPA in its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) provided a strong indication that use of add-on control
equipment may be feasible for controlling end seal compound VOC emissions. However, after reviewing the comments,
USEPA agrees that use of add-on control equipment doesn't appear feasible. In addition, Van Camp has switched over
to a solventless, waterborne end sealing compound for its pet food cans. However, USEPA has considered other relevant
information, as discussed in this notice, including comments received, in conjunction with the data cited in the
NPR, in its final evaluation of the proposed relaxation. Therefore, any shortcomings, or limitations, in the data
cited in the NPR, have been taken into consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Amendment cannot now be approved in total, it should at least be approved in part, by allowing relaxation of VOC
standards for the period when compliance would otherwise have been technically and commercially impracticable,
i.e., at least until May 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Only with Campbell's May 1989 conversion to a compliant end-sealing compound, following extensive research and
development efforts funded by Campbell to develop and apply such a compound, is there evidence that a 3.7 pound standard
became technically and commercially feasible for Campbell's Ohio facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA can only act on a proposed revision that has been submitted to it. Therefore, USEPA's only option is to approve
or disapprove a permanent relaxation of the food can end sealing compound limit. It should be emphasized that as of
May 1989 Campbell came into compliance with the 3.7 pounds VOC per gallon food can end seal compound limit. Therefore,
USEPA does not believe approval of the permanent relaxation is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If relaxation of the VOC standard to 4.4 pounds for the period ending May 1989, cannot now be approved for the entire
food can end sealing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound category, it should at least be allowed for such period for the human food can end sealing compound category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the response to comment 2, USEPA can only act on a proposed revision that has been submitted to it. The submitted
rule provides for a relaxation for the entire category and cannot be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, if the Amendment cannot now be approved in whole or in part, it should not now be rejected with prejudice.
Rather, OEPA should be given a chance to modify or supplement the Amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``USEPA's proposed rulemaking notes that OEPA did not consider certain Van Camp data, i.e., the Lake paper which,
in fact, was only publicly presented after the date the Amendment was submitted to USEPA. Accordingly, if the Amendment
cannot now be approved in whole or part, and if such data is still deemed relevant by USEPA, these proceedings should
be remanded without prejudice to OEPA so that the data can be considered, findings made, and, if deemed appropriate
by OEPA, the Amendment resubmitted to USEPA in the same or modified form after the new data has been fully considered.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA has an obligation to act on any pending SIP revision request and does not have the authority to ``remand'' such
a submittal to the State. However, the State has the ability to withdraw or amend a pending SIP revision request at any
time prior to final USEPA action. After USEPA takes final action on a SIP submittal, the State still may submit revisions
to the existing SIP. USEPA will act on any proposed SIP revision submitted by Ohio in the future including additional
relaxation requests for end sealing compounds. Any relaxation would need to be consistent with section 193 of the
amended CAA. Moreover, it should be noted that USEPA has considered comments from OEPA on the Van Camp data in its final
evaluation.

2. Heekin Can Submitted Comments on July 27, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These comments include background information, comments on the infeasibility of add-on controls, and comments
on the unavailability of low solvent compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before reviewing the infeasibility and unavailability issues it should be recognized that the level of VOCs that
was emitted at the Heekin facility in 1987 as a result of following the food can end seal regulation (4.4 pounds of VOC
per gallon) instead of the general VOC content end seal limitation (3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon) amounted to only 27.89
tons of VOC. Total VOC emissions from the entire end seal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation at the facility were 219.27 tons for 1987, while plant-wide emissions (base coaters, litho presses, side
seam strippers, and end seal liner machines) were 652 tons per year after controls. Thus, the level of emissions sought
to be restricted by disapproving the food can end seal VOC limit is only 4.2 percent of the emissions from the facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The level of control technology that constitutes RACT is a function of technical and economical feasibility, and
not emission impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, excess emissions of 27.89 tons of VOC per year is not a negligible quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2_Infeasibility of Add-on Controls:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of USEPA's reliance on the Lake article and the Van 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Camp study, Heekin commissioned a RACT study by Camp, Dresser, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
McKee (CDM). CDM focused on collecting VOCs from the application, conveying, and bagging stages of the end seal lining
process. Warehousing areas were disregarded by Lake and CDM as being infeasible to control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDM performed a complete RACT analysis tailored specifically for Heekin's Hamilton County, Ohio can manufacturing
facility. A total of five end seal lining processes (10 applicators) were considered for control. Before discussing
the results of CDM's RACT study, it should be noted that CDM disregarded the carbon adsorption control option because
of the difficulties encountered with regeneration. Steam regeneration of spent carbon creates a hazardous waste
requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costly disposal. Hot air regeneration requires an incinerator which duplicates the incinerator control technology
option. Also, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that hexane, the major solvent in the end seal lining compounds, has a poor adsorption efficiency. Thus,
Lake's reporting of a cost effectiveness figure for a carbon adsorption collection system is not supported by CDM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDM focused on thermal and catalytic incineration as preferable control options and determined that the capital
cost for a catalytic incinerator system was $1,854,600, approximately $320,000 higher than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capital cost of a thermal incineration system. The annual operating expense for the catalytic incineration system
was estimated to be $1,608,719 per year, $2,008,719 per year for thermal incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dividing the annual cost to operate the control system by the quantity of VOC reduced yields the ``cost effectiveness''
of the control system. CDM's analysis utilized three figures for the quantity of VOC removed per year: (1) The quantity
of VOC removed to reach equivalence with the general end seal compound limit of 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon (i.e., 27.89
tons per year); (2) the quantity of VOC removed assuming a 40 percent capture efficiency (i.e., 87.70 tons per year);
and (3) the quantity of VOC removed assuming that Perlis' 80 percent capture efficiency is correct (i.e., 175.4 tons
per year). Heekin does not believe that an 80 percent collection efficiency on the system is possible but has calculated
the ``cost effectiveness'' for comparison purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDM determined the following ``cost effectiveness'' figures. For scenario one, removal of sufficient VOCs to reach
equivalence with the 3.7 pounds per gallon emission rate limitation, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $71,597 per ton
of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $57,681 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario
two, removal of VOCs with a 40 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $23,235 per ton of VOC removed
for thermal incineration and $19,310 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario three, removal
of VOCs with an 80 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $10,853 per ton of VOC removed for thermal
incineration and $9,020 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the above detailed ``cost effectiveness'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures were calculated based on can end residence times through the collection system reported by Lake. However,
Heekin's actual residence times are much shorter. Lake reported a total residence time for Van Camp of 1.5 minutes.
During the Perlis test, a residence time of 3.0 minutes was contrived to gain an 87 percent capture efficiency. Heekin's
process lines have a total residence time from lining to stacking/bagging of only 20 to 65 seconds. The discrepancy
between Heekin's residence time and the Van Camp/Perlis residence times means that the collection efficiencies
for the capture system if it were to be installed at Heekin would be much lower than the collection efficiencies reported
by Lake. Thus, the cost effectiveness figures estimated by CDM are on the low side compared to what Heekin could actually
attain because the amount of VOCs removed would be much lower.

USEPA Response:

 Add-on control is not used on any end seal compound coating lines. USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible
for this application.

Comment 3_Unavailability of Low Solvent Compounds:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 USEPA stated in its proposed disapproval of Ohio's Food Can End Regulation that the Lake article and the Van Camp data
indicated ``possible feasibility'' of low solvent coatings. According to the article, Van Camp was successful at
replacing ``9101'' compound with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-based end sealing compound, ``480T''. The replacement compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was used by Van Camp to manufacture ends to be used for pet food cans. Van Camp continued to use the ``9101'' compound
for its human consumption product line, tuna fish cans. Thus, Van Camp came into compliance with the 3.7 pounds of VOC
per gallon limitation by averaging noncompliant VOC emissions from ``9101'' usage with water-based emissions from
``480T'' usage. The Van Camp facility continues to operate in this fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before addressing the viability of the low solvent coating option, one must understand the distinction between a
``captive'' and a ``merchant'' can manufacturer. A ``captive'' can manufacturer supplies cans only for one customer,
itself. Conversely, a ``merchant'' can manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies cans for several customers according to the customer's varied requirements and individualized specifications.
Thus, a ``merchant'' manufacturer has little control over the coatings it must use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabricate the cans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heekin is a ``merchant'' manufacturer. Van Camp was a ``captive'' manufacturer at the time of the Lake article. Thus,
the feasibility of a lower solvent coating for Heekin is complicated by additional determining factors that Van Camp
does not have (i.e., Heekin must satisfy the customer's manufacturing requirements and Heekin has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leverage or internal pressure by which to force a customer to make a change). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the first promulgation of the RACT regulations, Heekin has made a concerted effort at advising and steering
its customers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying coatings and compounds with low solvent formulations. With regard to end seal liner compounds, however,
Heekin is serving several customers that have refused to accept a low solvent formulation as a replacement to the end
seal liner compound with VOC contents exceeding 3.7 pounds per gallon. The major customer in this category is Ross
Laboratories in Columbus, Ohio. Ross Laboratories is the nation's largest producer of milk and soy protein infant
formulas. They also manufacture medical nutritional products for hospital and home use. Ross has made the determination
that ``1105'' compound is the only suitable compound for fabricating cans for these highly sensitive products. Other

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national food processing customers specifying ``1105'' and ``9101'' end seal compounds include: Quaker Oats Company,
American Home Foods, and Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disallowing the food can end seal regulation will put Heekin at a disadvantage in the ``merchant'' can manufacturer's
market. When approached by Heekin representatives regarding the possibility that Heekin may no longer be able to
use ``1105'', the manager of the purchasing department stated that an option for Ross Laboratories, if the regulation
is disapproved and Heekin no longer can supply ``1105'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends, is to move its business to another ``merchant'' can manufacturer that is not restricted by the end seal liner
RACT regulation. Thus, since low solvent end seal compounds are not an option for Heekin's customers, Heekin must
have the ability to continue to use the ``9101'' and ``1105'' compounds for food can ends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Heekin has not adequately demonstrated that 4.4 lbs VOC per gallon is RACT for food can end sealing compounds for the
following reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Other State regulations have a 3.7 lbs/gallon limit for end sealing compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) amended its can coating rules (in early 1990). These regulations
specify 3.7 lbs/gallon for end sealing compounds for food cans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Campbell Soup stated, in its comments, that in May 1989, Campbell converted to a compliant end sealing compound,
following extensive research and development efforts funded by Campbell to develop and apply such a compound. This
is ``evidence that a 3.7 pound standard became technically and commercially feasible for Campbell's Ohio facility.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There is no indication that 3.7 lbs/gallon end sealing compounds are unavailable for certain type food cans, e.g.,
pet food cans and fruit and vegetable cans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Heekin has not demonstrated that it made a substantial effort to develop and/or locate complying end seal compounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In its June 27, 1989, letter, Ross Laboratories states that there are no qualified replacements, to Dewey and Almy's
``1105'' end seal compound, available. The letter falls short of saying that they would refuse to use any other suitable
product, if it exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The fact that Heekin is a ``merchant'' manufacturer is not a sufficient reason for it to have a less stringent limit.
Job shops are common in the coating industry and have not in the past been given special consideration because they
have to deal with a number of customers. The feasibility of compliant end seal compounds for Heekin's customers' cans
is more relevant than its status as a ``merchant'' manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, USEPA does agree that 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds for certain applications may not be available. A
July 12, 1989, letter from Neil Moyer, (then) Director of Rule Development for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCAQMD, states that compliant end seal compounds are a problem for cans used for tuna and other oily products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heekin may, in fact, have a problem with end seal compounds for certain products. However, USEPA does not have the ability
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create exemptions for Heekin. The State has not submitted such a rule. The State submitted relaxation (to 4.4 lbs/gallon)
for all end seal compounds is overly broad and cannot be approved. Furthermore, Heekin has not adequately demonstrated
the lowest VOC content feasible for its end seal compounds for specified applications.

3. Central States Can Company Submitted Comments on July 26, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would be interested to know if there are any end lines running with off-line controls that can maintain a reduction
efficiency of 76 percent (80% capture, 95% control) over a long period of time. The type of control systems that could
be used on end lining systems would require a residence time of several hours and seem to be totally impractical considering
the size required and the operational cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA is not aware of add-on control being used on any end seal compound coating lines. USEPA agrees that add-on control
is not feasible for this application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We note that the ``480T'' compound has been used on pet food. OEPA (presumably commenter means USEPA) seems to be proposing
its use on all foods on the basis of tests with pet food. It should be pointed out that many other products besides pet
food (including infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula) are packed and should be considered before such a change is made. The USEPA cannot ignore food safety in its
proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA agrees that there appear to be some products which cannot use 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds. However, there
appear to be some food cans (e.g., pet food cans) which can use compliant end seal compounds. It is the State's responsibility
to demonstrate that the requirements it submits are RACT. The burden is on the State to show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which cans another limit (above 3.7) is RACT and what is that appropriate limit. For example, an adequate demonstration
has not been made of the lowest VOC content feasible for end seal compounds used for products such as infant formula.
Because the State has submitted a general relaxation of the end seal limit and has not demonstrated that the relaxed
limit is RACT for all end seal compounds, USEPA cannot approve the relaxation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we are confident that other foods can successfully use an alternate compound, it is important that these products
be tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to making such a change. It is not unreasonable that this testing for all products may require as much as 5 years.
It is, therefore, requested that the Ohio proposed relaxation be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for testing does not, in itself, justify a permanent relaxation. Central States Can has provided no specifics
about food safety testing, and it is therefore not possible to evaluate the effects it would have. The nature and length
of the testing is also not specified. Furthermore, there are no details or support for the Central States comment that
``It is not unreasonable that this testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all products may require as much as 5 years.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. The Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) Submitted Comments on July 28, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CMI supports OEPA's action to raise the VOC end seal compound limits. CMI's specific comments are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
CMI's Position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CMI opposes the basis of USEPA's proposed denial of Ohio's revision of end seal compound VOC limits. We believe USEPA's
reliance on the study of Van Camp's efforts in San Diego is misguided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, CMI is concerned that the Agency is willing to risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangering the food supply or forcing Ohio-based can makers to surrender business to obtain minuscule gains in the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Van Camp Study by Michael Lake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, Michael Lake of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District, San Diego, California, presented a paper
entitled ``VOC Emission Control for Can End Sealing Compounds: A Case History.'' This study outlines the Van Camp
Company's experience in testing, qualifying and running water-based end seal compound. It also broached the possibility
of using add-on equipment around end seal application operations. USEPA cites Van Camp's narrow experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with add-on control equipment and water-based end seal compound as the rationale for denying Ohio's proposed rules
3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (D)(1)(e) and (D)(2)(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Add-On Controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The add-on control equipment referred to in the Lake study was not installed on a permanent basis. The Van Camp plant
managers in 1987 told CMI that initial tests of mock-up add-on equipment showed the system was impractical from an
engineering and production standpoint. The Lake study cites three very serious concerns of Van Camp concerning add-on
control equipment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The prototype VOC containment/capture system had not been tested under rigorous, extended-production conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The system might not allow sufficient visual and physical access by line operators; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Carbon adsorption was and still is an unproven technology for control of VOC emissions from can end sealing lines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMI asserts that a theoretical system which did not prove practical, safe or efficacious should not be used as a basis
for USEPA to deny a reasonable regulatory action by Ohio's environmental authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Water-Based End Seal Compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of the Van Camp Study on water-based end seal compound to deny relaxation of the Ohio VOC limits wrongly assumes
these test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions are acceptable to qualify end seal compound for other types of packs and containers. The process required
to safely qualify a new end seal compound is linked to different packing and food conditions. As a general rule, more
testing is required for materials which are used on a broad basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The successful use of a water-based end seal compound by Van Camp, a division of the Ralston Purina Company, is limited
to a very specific, narrow category of food products_tuna and pet food. The Ohio can manufacturers who would be subject
to this rule produce containers for a wide variety of products, including baby food, soups and vegetables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For USEPA to assume that uniformity exists between the processes which Van Camp and Ohio can makers use to qualify end
seal compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to short change the factors which are necessary to ensure food safety and shows a considerable lack of understanding
of the delicate nature under which food is processed and packaged. CMI is concerned that USEPA is willing to risk the
safety of the American food supply in order to obtain minimal gains toward attainment of the NAAQS in Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1984 and 1985, CMI and its Ohio-based members asked OEPA to relax the VOC end seal limits because they could not use
lower solvent end seal compound with the complete certainty that food safety would be assured. If a catastrophic failure
were to occur in a single canned product which resulted in the illness or death of a consumer, the integrity of all canned
foods would be suspect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: USEPA's position on these issues has been previously stated in the response to Heekin's and Central States Can's
comments. In summary, it is agreed that add-on control has not been demonstrated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible for end seal compound application operations. However, it has not been documented that 4.4 lbs/gallon is
the most stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit that is feasible for food can end seal compounds in general. Furthermore, the CMI has not documented the effect
that food safety concerns have on using 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds. For example, if CMI's position is that 3.7
lbs/gallon end seal compound cannot be used with canned vegetables (for example) due to safety reasons, it has not
supported its position.

5. OEPA Submitted Comments on July 31, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Michael Lake report (paper) was not provided to OEPA during OEPA's public hearing on the eventual 1986 rulemaking.
Therefore, OEPA could not consider such information. Since USEPA has added that report to the docket, USEPA must show
that the report, which pertains to a specific plant in a specific food industry, is applicable to all food industries
or at least the food industries in Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If complying end sealing compounds (at the ``3.7'' level) are or will be available, OEPA asks that USEPA provide some
guidance on the proper date for compliance. The original RACT regulations, as envisioned by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA, were to require compliance by the end of 1982 with a time extension up through the end of 1985 for some can plants
where adequately justified. The Michael Lake paper shows that ``it may be feasible and cost effective to control VOC
emissions at the line with carbon adsorption or incineration'' according to USEPA. At what level of cost-effectiveness?
Does that transfer to plants in Ohio? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is OEPA's responsibility to demonstrate that 4.4 lbs/gallon is the most stringent limit that is feasible for food
can end seal compounds. OEPA provides no basis for its statement that ``U.S. EPA must show that the report, which pertains
to a specific plant in a specific food industry, is applicable to all food industries or at least the food industries
in Ohio.'' It would be appropriate for Ohio to provide adequate support for a relaxation that would make its limit the
least stringent in the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, additional time to achieve compliance with Ohio's end seal limit will only be considered by USEPA if it
is proposed and submitted by OEPA. As stated previously, USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible for this
operation. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness issue is moot.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 A. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio added paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) to establish recordkeeping requirements for those persons using
or applying cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt during the period from May 15 through September 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA proposed disapproval because these recordkeeping requirements are inadequate in that they do not apply to
the appropriate SIP period of April 15 through October 15. Although in its State regulations, Ohio currently has an
exemption period of September 15 through May 15, USEPA disapproved that extended exemption period when it was submitted
as a SIP revision. 54 FR 1934. The applicable SIP exemption period is October 15 through April 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current USEPA approved regulations, the use or application of cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt during
October 15 through April 15 is exempt from limitations. Thus, the recordkeeping requirements are necessary for the
remaining period: April 15 through October 15.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recordkeeping requirements and the September 15 through May 15 exemption period are considered adequate in light
of the USEPA Region VI's proposed approval of the Texas regulation which had a September 15 through April 15 exemption
period in a much warmer spring-fall period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) only deals with recordkeeping requirements and not when cutback asphalt
is allowed to be used. Ohio's Federally approved SIP does not allow cutback asphalt to be used from April 15 through
October 15. Unless and until the exemption period is changed (in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)), the recording requirements
must reflect the SIP requirements. Therefore, Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) should be finally disapproved.

A. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph states that the control requirements of (N)(1) and (N)(2) shall not apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the use or application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing, provided
the maximum daily usage is less than one thousand gallons 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
for any work crew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA proposed to disapprove this exemption (without the underlined words) on March 6, 1985 (and finally disapproved
this exemption on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1934)), and proposed to disapprove the rule as revised in the May 30, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This exemption is supported by a November 3, 1982, letter from the Ohio Department of Transportation which states
that ``Our attempts at using emulsified asphalt as crack sealers have not generally been satisfactory.'' The County
Engineers Association of Ohio, in a June 22, 1982, letter, requested OEPA to ``Permit use of cutback asphalt for patching
up to a usage not to exceed 2,000 gallons per day at any time of the year''. The County Engineers stated that this requested
change ``would improve the efficiency and economy of road paving and maintenance work.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language added to the end of (N)(3)(e) clarifies the exemption. However, this clarifying language could result
in substantially increased VOC emissions because it clarifies that the one thousand gallons per day refers to each
work crew. Therefore, this clarifying language, and the supporting documentation, does not change USEPA's position
on this exemption, for which an adequate basis has not been provided. USEPA informed OEPA of this in its September 17,
1985, comment letter.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The hand application exemption for crack sealers and road patching conforms to the best judgement of the engineering
staff at the Ohio Department of Transportation and the County Engineers Association of Ohio. Ohio's record in the
conversion to acceptable emulsified asphalts is above the median level of the 35 regulated States. This exemption
is certainly minor when considering this fact.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ohio's ratio of emulsified to cutback asphalt used in 1987 is not a valid basis for exempting the hand application of
cutback asphalt. This exemption is inconsistent with USEPA guidance and its previous

constitute RACT and it has provided no data on the amount of additional cutback asphalt that is used in the ozone season
as a result of the exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph establishes a limitation of 4.8 lbs VOC/gallon of coating, excluding water, for a heat resistant,
anti-corrosion coating applied to the interior of a motor vehicle directly above the catalytic converter. This revision
was proposed for disapproval because it is a relaxation of approved VOC emission limits in Ohio's ozone SIP and Ohio
has not made a demonstration that this relaxation will not interfere with attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Furthermore, the July 29, 1983, memorandum titled ``Source Specific SIP Revisions''
by Sheldon Meyers, former Director of Air Quality Planning and Standards, addresses the issue of VOC SIP relaxations.
This memorandum states that approval of such a relaxation would require a data base and modeling demonstration consistent
with that applied in extension areas. The sources subject to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relaxation are located in Lordstown and Dayton, Ohio. There have not been any revised attainment demonstrations,
consistent with those done for extension areas, submitted for these areas.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The required demonstration will be made as part of the upcoming post-1987 ozone SIP submissions. USEPA is asked to
accept such commitment on the part of OEPA. Region VI has accepted such commitment for a future SIP impact assessment
at 54 FR 23672 on June 2, 1989 (regarding Vulcan Materials Company, Geismar Chemicals Plant).

5. Architectural Aluminum Coating-Rule 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The VOC requirement in this paragraph establishes a limitation of 6.2 lbs VOC/gallon of coating excluding water for
high performance architectural aluminum coatings. OEPA considers this limitation to constitute RACT. This relaxation
is supported by a September 6, 1985, letter from Reynolds Aluminum, to OEPA. This letter states that ``We have been
unable to convert our High Performance Architectural Aluminum Coatings to a low solvent formulation.'' Reynolds
attached a December 6, 1984, letter from PPG which states that its efforts to develop compliant coatings for the architectural
and recreational vehicle markets have been unsuccessful. USEPA proposed to disapprove this relaxation because
OEPA has neither documented the infeasibility of add-on control nor the potential use of powder coatings. Three of
these suppliers, Armstrong Products, Fuller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O'Brien, and Polymer Corporation, expect their coatings to pass the 5 year exposure test. Some of these are currently
in the third or fourth year of their 5-year testing period. Therefore, a permanent relaxation for high performance
architectural aluminum coatings is not approvable.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA purported availability of compliant coatings for high performance architectural aluminum coatings at
3.5 lbs VOC per gallon from Armstrong Products, Fuller O'Brien, and Polymer Corporation should be documented in the
docket. If a permanent relaxation is not appropriate, does USEPA recommend a relaxation for a specific year (e.g.,
up to 1989 or 1990)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Documentation of USEPA's conversations with powder coating suppliers is in the Docket. The CTGs and Ohio SIP establish
the presumptive RACT for this source category. Ohio's comments provide no support for its proposed relaxation. USEPA
is only able to take actions on proposed SIP revisions that are submitted to it. USEPA will evaluate the merits of a compliance
date extension if submitted and supported by OEPA. Therefore, USEPA is disapproving this relaxation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OEPA had proposed a number of revisions to its RACT I, RACT II, and general VOC rules. These are contained in OAC Chapter
3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, Definitions; OAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04, Compliance and Schedules; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09, Emission Limits;
and OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;10, Test Methods. A listing and short 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of all of these revisions are in USEPA's technical support documents, dated July 14, 1986, September
23, 1986, and July 27, 1988. Many of these revisions are minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio submitted these regulations in 1986 in order to meet the RACT requirement of the pre-amended Act and USEPA reviewed
this submittal against the general RACT requirement of the preamended Act, 1977 Act &sect;172.54 FR 22915 (May 30,
1989). Since USEPA did not issue a SIP call with respect to the elements of this submittal, these revisions are not required
under the section 182(a)(2)(A) RACT fix-up requirement of the Act. However, amended section 172 retains a general
requirement that States must adopt RACT for nonattainment areas. Therefore, USEPA is taking final partial approval
action as proposed under Section 110 and Part D of the Amended Act, with the exception of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. USEPA is disapproving the proposed relaxation for food can end sealing compounds in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(D)(1)(e)
(from 3.7 to 4.4 lbs VOC/gal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. USEPA is disapproving the proposed revision to the exemption, as well as the entire exemption in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e)
for the application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing. In addition,
USEPA is disapproving the recordkeeping requirements in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) because they are inadequate
with respect to the time period during which records are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. USEPA is disapproving the relaxation (from 3.5 to 6.2 lbs VOC/gal) for high performance architectural aluminum
coatings in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In the proposed rulemaking for this revision published at 54 FR 22915 (May 30, 1989), USEPA proposed to take no action
on the exemption for new sources in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(U)(2)(f). USEPA believes that the Amended Clean Air Act
affects this element and will repropose action on it consistent with the amended Act in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In the May 30, 1989, proposed rulemaking for this revision, USEPA proposed to disapprove the relaxation for miscellaneous
metals in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(vii). This requested rule relaxation will be reproposed in a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice because the relevant policy has changed with the Amended Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, Ohio's April 9, 1986, State submittal included new VOC regulations for additional RACT III source
categories not specifically covered by Ohio's existing rules and a site-specific revision for the Huffy Corporation.
This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document does not address these other elements of the April 9, 1986, submittal. This notice also does not address those
amendments to the ozone SIP that were previously submitted on March 28, 1983, to USEPA and for which final rulemaking
was taken on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1934). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, this action is not significant. It has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has adopted rules establishing general procedures that will apply whenever it employs a system of
competitive bidding (``auctions'') to choose from among mutually exclusive applications for certain initial licenses.
This action is taken to implement section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Procedures applicable
to specific services will be determined in future Reports and Orders. The new rules will promote the development and
rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing
in rural areas. These rules also will promote economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate licenses among
a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members
of minority groups and women. This action will provide recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public
spectrum made available for commercial use.

 In the Second Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, the Commission has amended 47 CFR part 1 to add a new Subpart
Q which contains the general rules and requirements governing the competitive bidding process for certain initial
licenses. Applicants are required to file certain information so that the Commission can determine whether the applicants
are legally, technically, and financially qualified to be licensed. Affected public are any member of the public
who wants to become a licensee. The foregoing estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the burden estimates or any
other aspect of the collection of information including suggestions for reducing the burden to the Federal Communications
Commission Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction project, Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of
the Management and Budget Paperwork reduction project, Washington, DC 20503.

Summary of Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In this Second Report and Order, we prescribe general rules and procedures to implement the Commission's new authority
under Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to use competitive bidding to award licenses for
use of the radio spectrum. In the future, in subsequent Reports and Orders, specific rules within the scope of these
general rules will be adopted for each service subject to competitive bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A voluminous number of comments and reply comments were filed by interested parties in response to the Notice of
Proposed Rule Making (58 FR 53489 (October 15, 1993)) in this docket. These comments address the many proposals made
in the Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility of License Applications for Competitive Bidding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Commission will use competitive bidding to award licenses only when the statutory criteria for auctionability
set forth in Section 309(j) of the Communications Act are met. First, there must be mutually exclusive applications
for an initial license or construction permit. Second, the service applied for must principally involve the transmission
or reception of communications services to subscribers for compensation. Applying these criteria, the Commission
determined that mutually exclusive licenses in the Interactive Video Data Service (IVDS), the Personal Communications
Services, most of the Public Mobile Services, the Multipoint Distribution Service, the Multichannel Multipoint
Distribution Service, the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, Marine Public Coast Stations and for exclusive frequencies
above 900 MHz in the Private Carrier Paging Service should be awarded through competitive bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because licensees in the Broadcast Radio and Broadcast Television Services, Maritime Operational Fixed Stations,
Personal Radio Services (except IVDS), certain Private Land Mobile Radio Services and certain other services do
not receive compensation from subscribers, these services are excluded from the competitive bidding process. The
following kinds of applications are not subject to competitive bidding: Applications for renewal of licenses, most
applications for modification, applications for subsidiary communications services, and applications for frequencies
used as intermediate links in the provision of service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Competitive Bidding Design Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. We adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions as our primary auction methodology. However, as the record convinces
us that there is no single competitive bidding design that is optimal for all auctionable services and because Congress
directed us to design and test multiple alternative methodologies, we have provided alternative methods from which
to choose under appropriate circumstances. The alternative design options are single round sealed bid auctions
(either sequential or simultaneous) and sequential oral auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The two primary characteristics that will determine the choice of auction design are: (1) The degree to which licenses
are interdependent, and (2) whether the expected license values are high or low. Because we expect most licenses to
be of high value and interdependent, the simultaneous multiple round auction is our preferred auction design. The
Commission will select the competitive bidding design to be used in auctioning particular licenses on a service-specific
basis. Combinatorial bidding, which may be used with any type of auction, is also authorized for use as a competitive
bidding mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures to Implement the Competitive Bidding Designs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. To efficiently implement the competitive bidding designs, we must specify certain auction procedures. We will
choose from these procedures and incorporate them into the service-specific rules that we will adopt in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sequencing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will choose the sequence of what is auctioned. The importance of the choice of sequence increases with the degree
of interdependence among the items auctioned in sequence. We intend to minimize the importance of the choice of sequence
by auctioning licenses sequentially only when there is not a high degree of value interdependence across the licenses
or groups that are offered in sequence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duration of bidding rounds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In simultaneous multiple round auctions, bids can be submitted continuously with the high bids announced at the
end of each round. With discrete rounds, the Commission can more readily control the pace at which the auction proceeds.
The duration of bidding rounds and the interval between rounds in simultaneous multiple round auctions may be varied
by announcement during the course of an auction. We generally intend to give bidders a single business day to submit
bids and intend to conduct a new bidding round each business day, but we may choose other round lengths and intervals
between rounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum bid increments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In multiple round auctions, whether they be sequential or simultaneous, the Commission will generally specify
minimum bid increments. The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous
round's high bid in order to be accepted as a valid bid in the current round. Imposing a minimum bid increment speeds
the progress of the auction and, along with activity and stopping rules, helps to ensure that the auction comes to closure
within a reasonable period of time. We reserve the right to specify minimum bid increments in dollar terms as well as
in percentage terms. We also may vary the minimum bid increments with respect to different licenses being awarded
in one auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stopping rules for multiple round auctions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Prior to each multiple round auction, the Commission will announce by Public Notice a stopping rule for determining
when the auction is over. We seek a stopping rule that will (1) terminate the auction in a reasonable period of time,
(2) be simple and clearly understood by participating bidders and observers of the auction process, and (3) in the
case of simultaneous auctions, close all markets at approximately the same time. In simultaneous auctions, the stopping
rules must also specify whether to close markets individually or simultaneously. Hybrid stopping rules are also
possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The following stopping rules are preferred: (1) When auctioning licenses one at a time, or simultaneously and
closing markets one at a time bidding on a market will close if a single round passes in which no new acceptable bids (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, no bids that meet any applicable bid increment rule) are submitted for that license; (2) when auctioning licenses
simultaneously and closing markets simultaneously_bidding on all markets will close if a single round passes in
which no new acceptable bids are submitted for any license.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Activity rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To ensure that simultaneous auctions with our preferred simultaneous stopping rule close within a reasonable period
of time, an activity rule is likely to be necessary to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before
participating. Where we decide to employ an activity rule, we will seek one that (1) moves auctions along at an appropriate
speed, (2) provides bidders with sufficient flexibility to pursue a wide range of alternative bidding strategies,
and (3) is simple and clearly understood by participating bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. When the Commission employs a simultaneous stopping rule, our preferred activity rule will be the three stage
rule proposed by Professors Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson. Under this rule, the minimum activity level, measured
as a fraction of the self declared maximum eligibility, would increase during the course of the auction. The auction
would be divided into three stages. During the first stage of the auction, bidders would be required to be active on
licenses encompassing at least one-third of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the second stage, bidders
would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible.
In the third stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing 100 percent of the MHz-pops for
which they are eligible. Bidders under this rule would be required to meet these activity levels to retain their desired
eligibility. A shortfall in activity would reduce eligibility levels accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The Commission retains the flexibility to choose among activity rules, other than the three stage Milgrom-Wilson
rule, on a case-by-case basis. These include: (1) A Milgrom-Wilson rule with one or two stages, (2) a rule that requires
bidders to be active on a single license, (3) a rule that requires that a bidder's activity level remain within a single
range throughout the action, (4) a rule that replaces the maximum allowed bidding levels in the Milgrom-Wilson rule
with a bidding premium for exceeding those maximums, or (5) a combination of the foregoing rules. We conclude that
a waiver procedure is necessary in conjunction with a Milgrom-Wilson activity rule. Under our preferred option,
bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers of the minimum activity requirement during the course of an auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bid withdrawal and default penalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a high bid is withdrawn prior to the close of a simultaneous round auction, the Commission will impose a penalty equal
to the difference between the withdrawn bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by
the Commission. No withdrawal penalty will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. If
a winning bidder defaults after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be required to pay the foregoing
penalty plus an additional penalty equal to three percent of the amount of the winning bid the next time the license
is offered by the Commission or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bidder's bid, whichever is less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. In the case of open outcry auctions, the Commission may choose not to impose any penalty for bid withdrawal during
the course of an auction and instead rely only on the default penalty to discourage insincere bidding. The default
penalty will be assessed if a bidder fails to make the down payment on a license, fails to pay for a license or is disqualified
after the close of an auction. In connection with single round bidding, only the basic penalty (and not the additional
three percent penalty) would generally apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Release of Bid Information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We will announce bidder identification numbers and bid amounts during the course of an auction, but not the identities
of bidders, to avoid potential manipulation and collusion among bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delay, Suspension or Cancellation of Auction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By Public Notice or by announcement during an auction, the Commission may delay, suspend or cancel an auction in the
event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of auction security breach, unlawful bidding activity,
administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects the fair and competitive conduct of the competitive
bidding. In such cases, the Commission may, at its sole discretion, resume the auction starting from the beginning
of the current or some previous round or may cancel the auction in its entirety.

Pre-Auction Procedures and Bidder and License Qualification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. To streamline the processing of auction applications and ensure that bidders and licensees are qualified, we
are adopting the following procedures. Usually, no less than 75 days before each scheduled auction, the Commission
will release a Public Notice announcing the auction. The initial Public Notice will normally contain information
such as the licenses to be auctioned and the time, place and method of competitive bidding to be used, including applicable
bid withdrawal procedures and penalties, stopping rules and activity rules.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. The initial Public Notice will also specify filing windows for short-form applications (no long form applications
are to be filed at this stage of the competitive bidding application procedure) and bidder certifications, filing
fees, upfront and down payments. Applications filed before or after the dates specified in the Public Notice will
not be accepted by the Commission. Applications submitted after the deadline specified will be dismissed with prejudice.
An auction information package will be made available to prospective bidders after the release of the initial Public
Notice. Slightly different procedures will apply when the rules permit applicants to submit long form applications
after the occurrence or nonoccurrence of certain events (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
passage of time and failure to serve a particular area).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The short-form applications and bidder certifications will normally require applicants to provide the following
information: (1) The license(s) for which the applicant wishes to bid, (2) the applicant's name, (3) the identity
of the person(s) authorized to bid, (4) certifications that the applicant is legally, technically, financially,
and otherwise qualified, and (5) certification that the applicant satisfies any financial qualification  requirements
for the service in question. Applicants seeking to file as designated entities eligible for bidding preferences
must indicate their status in the short-form application and must certify that they are qualified to file  as designated
entities. Bidders will also be required to identify all parties with whom they have entered into partnerships, joint
ventures, consortium, or other arrangements or agreements. Bidders will also be required to certify on their short-form
applications that they have not entered into any explicit or implicit agreements with any parties other than those
identified regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular properties on which they will
or will not bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. After reviewing the short-form applications, the Commission will issue a Public Notice listing all defective
applications and notify applicants of the specific defect. If the Commission receives only one application that
is acceptable for filing for a particular license, the Commission will issue a Public Notice cancelling the auction
for this license and establishing a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which would trigger
the relevant procedures permitting petitions to deny. Applicants whose short-form applications are substantially
complete but have minor errors or defects will be provided an opportunity to correct their applications prior to the
auction. However, applicants will not be permitted to make any major modifications to their applications, including
ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia. Also, applications that are
not signed or that fail to make the requisite certifications will be dismissed as unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release another Public Notice announcing the
names of all applicants whose applications have been accepted for filing. Applicants identified in the Public Notice
will then be required to submit the full amount of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date
to be specified in that Public Notice which generally will be no later than 14 days before the scheduled auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Once the Commission has received from the lock-box bank the names of all applicants who have submitted timely unfront
payments, the Commission will issue a fourth Public Notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined
to be qualified to bid. Each of these applicants will be provided a bidder identification number and further information
and instructions regarding the auction procedures.

Competitive Bidding Payments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Upfront Payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most cases, some form of upfront payment is necessary to deter frivolous or insincere bidding. We have determined
that the best approach is to retain flexibility to determine the amount of upfront payment on an auction-by-auction
basis. Generally, a bidder must submit an upfront payment equal to $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination
of MHz-pops the bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding. A bidder may file applications for every
license being auctioned, but its actual bidding in any round of an auction will be limited by the amount of its upfront
payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Upfront payments will provide the Commission with a source of available funds in the event a penalty must be assessed
for bid withdrawal prior to further payments. In future Reports and Orders establishing service-specific auction
rules, we may determine that the $0.02 per pop per MHz formula is inappropriate because of product market or license
characteristics or auction design choice. In some circumstances, we may decide that it is more appropriate instead
to set a fixed upfront payment or eliminate the upfront payment. We therefore reserve the option of revising or waiving
the upfront payment. In such cases, we will adopt an alternative upfront payment in service-specific auction rules
or in the Public Notice announcing the auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. As a general rule, we will not cap upfront payments because we need to ensure that those bidding on large numbers
of licenses have the financial capability to build out those licenses and are bidding in good faith. However, we reserve
the right to institute caps in specific services if we are satisfied that an absolute dollar amount will provide sufficient
deterrence against frivolous bidding and pernicious strategic bidding. Setting a minimum upfront payment may be
appropriate when use of our preferred formula would result in a payment that would be too small. Although a general
minimum upfront payment of $2,500 is reasonable, we retain the flexibility to modify this amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. As a general matter, to protect the integrity of the auction process, all applicants should be required to tender
their upfront payments to the Commission prior to bidding. However, given the likely magnitude of some upfront payments
and the fact that there will be a significant interval between the date that short-form applications are filed and
the auction date, we will not require the filing of upfront payments with short-form applications. Upfront payments
will be required to be made to the Commission on a date to be announced by Public Notice, generally no later than 14 days
before the scheduled auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Down Payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 20 percent down payment is appropriate to ensure that auction winners have the necessary financial capabilities
to complete payment for the license and to pay for the costs of constructing a system and protect against possible default,
while at the same time not being so onerous as to hinder growth and diminish access. We therefore will require that winning
bidders supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to being their total deposits up to 20 percent
of their winning bid(s). The down payment by cashier's check or wire transfer to our lock-box will generally be required
within five business days after the auction is over.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remainder of License Payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will not permit licensees to satisfy their payment obligations to the Commission through the payment
of royalties. With the exception of certain designated entities, we are requiring full payment of the remainder of
the winning bid in a lump sum. This will leave financing to the private sector and eliminate the need for the Commission
to conduct detailed credit checks.

Default and Disqualification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is critically important to the success of our system of competitive bidding that potential bidders understand
that there will be a substantial penalty assessed if they withdraw a high bid, are found not to be qualified to hold licenses,
or default on a balance due. We will require any auction winner who defaults by failing to remit the required down payment
within the prescribed time to reimburse the Commission in the amount of the difference between its high bid and the
amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. A defaulting auction winner will also be assessed a penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the
subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the three percent penalty will be calculated
based on the defaulting bid's amount. This additional penalty will also apply if an auction winner is disqualified
or fails to remit the balance of its winning bid after having made the required down payment. We will hold deposits made
by defaulting or disqualified auction winners to help ensure that the penalty is paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
34. If a default or disqualification involves gross misconduct, misrepresentation, or bad faith by an applicant,
the Commission also may declare the applicant and its principals ineligible to bid in future auctions, and may take
any other action that it may deem necessary. Where specific instances of collusion in the competitive bidding process
are alleged during the petition to deny process, the Commission may conduct an investigation or refer such complaints
to the United States Department of Justice for investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. If the high bidder makes the down payment in a timely manner, a long-form application will be required to be filed
by a specified date, generally within ten business days after the close of the auction. The Commission will then review
the long-form application to determine if it is acceptable for filing. Upon acceptance for filing, the Commission
will release a Pubic Notice announcing acceptance for filing of the long-form application thus triggering the filing
window for petitions to deny.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. The long-form application must include as an exhibit a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement they have entered into relating
to the competitive bidding process prior to the close of bidding. All such arrangements must have been entered into
prior to the filing of the short-form application. If all petitions to deny are dismissed or denied, the Commission
is satisfied that the applicant is qualified, the license(s) will be granted to the auction winner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. The Commission need not conduct a hearing before denial if it determines that an applicant is not qualified and
no substantial issue of fact exists concerning that determination. In the event that the Commission identifies substantial
and material issues of fact in need of resolution, Sections 309 (j)(5) and (i)(2) of the Communications Act permit
in any hearing the submission of all or part of evidence in written form and allows employees other than administrative
law judges to preside at the taking of written evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. As a general rule, when an auction winner defaults on its final payment or is otherwise disqualified after having
made the required down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license. Nevertheless, if a default
occurs within five business days after the end of bidding, the Commission retains the right to offer the license to
the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer the license to other
bidders at their final bid levels. If a new auction becomes necessary because of a disqualification or default more
than five business days after the end of bidding, we will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications to
assure that serious interested bidders are in the pool of qualified bidders at any re-auction.

Reservation Prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We will retain the flexibility to utilize a reservation price below which a license would not be awarded if we decide
that it is appropriate in a particular auction. The reservation price could be disclosed, in which case it would effectively
constitute a minimum bid, or it could be undisclosed.

40. We will impose a transfer disclosure requirement on licenses obtained through the competitive bidding process,
whether by  a designated entity or not. We will give particular scrutiny to action winners who have not yet begun commercial
service and who seek approval for a transfer of control or assignment of their licenses within three years after the
initial license grant, in order to determine if any unforeseen problems relating to unjust enrichment have arisen
outside the designated entity context. The applicant will be required to file, together with its application, the
associated contracts for sale, option agreements and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received
in return for the transfer of its license

41. We believe that it is unnecessary and undesirable to impose performance requirements on all auctionable services
in excess of those set forth in service rules for most existing services. We do not believe that additional, general
requirements are needed to address concerns over ``warehousing'' of spectrum. With respect to those services where
no performance requirements currently exist, however, we will prescribe such performance rules as are necessary
at the same time we promulgate competitive bidding rules for each of those services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are adopting a menu of preferences from which we will choose in service-specific auction rules. These preferences
are designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women (collectively ``designated entities'') are given the opportunity to participate in both the competitive
bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. To qualify as a ``small business'' for the purposes
of competitive bidding, an entity must be an independently-owned business with a net worth not exceeding $6 million
dollars and an average net income after Federal income taxes for two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. In
order to be eligible for preferences, businesses owned by women or minorities will be required to have at least 50.1
percent equity ownership and a 50.1 percent controlling interest owned by women or minorities. Rural telephone companies
will be eligible for preferences if they are independently owned, have 50,000 access lines or fewer and serve communities
with no more than 10,000 inhabitants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Installment payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We may allow small businesses (including rural telephone companies and businesses owned by women and minorities
and rural telephone companies) that are winning bidders for certain blocks of spectrum to pay in installments over
the term of their licenses. As a general matter, we will only allow installment payments for licenses in those smaller
spectrum blocks that are most likely to match the business objectives of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
small businesses. The down payment for such designated entities will be 10 percent of the winning bid instead of 20
percent. Once the license is granted we will require that the remaining 10 percent of the down payment be made within
five business days of grant, thereby commencing the eligible entity's installment payment plan, which will extend
over the period of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. We will impose interest of installment payments equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations of maturity equal
to the license term. The schedule of installment payments will begin with interest-only payments for the first two
years. After that, principal and interest will be amortized over the remaining term of the license. An eligible designated
entity that elects installment payments will have its license conditioned upon the full and timely performance of
its payment obligations under the installment plan. However, we will consider (on a case-by-case basis) a grace period
before a delinquent payor's license cancels.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bidding credits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bidding credits (payment discounts) may be available to designated entities on certain frequency blocks. Competitive
bidding rules applicable to individual services will specify the designated entities eligible for bidding credits,
the licenses for which bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other procedures. We reserve
the option to determine, on a service-specific basis, whether certain auctionable services should allow other bidding
credits to a consortium of companies organized to bid for auctionable services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46. To further promote the investment and rapid deployment of new technologies and services in rural areas, we will
also institute a system of bidding credits for rural telephone companies for licenses in their rural service areas.
The amount of the bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be tied to their commitments to achieve certain
telecommunications infrastructure build-out milestones in their rural service areas. The amount of the bidding
credit will be proportionately linked to the amount by which the rural telephone company agrees to expand its built-out
commitment. Failure to meet a build-out commitment will result in liability for a penalty in the amount of the bidding
credit, plus interest. Grant of licenses to rural telephone companies utilizing bidding credits will be conditioned
upon payment of this penalty, if and when it becomes applicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Set-aside spectrum. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We may establish set-aside spectrum in certain services in which eligibility to bid may be limited to some or all designated
entities. For any auctions of set-aside spectrum, we anticipate that we will establish lower upfront payments. This
lower payment would serve to encourage participation by all eligible designated entities in the auction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tax certificates, distress sales and royalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will not at this time adopt a general tax certificate program for services subject to competitive bidding because
other available measures will generally provide sufficient incentive to attract investors in designated entity
enterprises. We will examine the feasibility of utilizing tax certificates in subsequent competitive bidding rules
for particular services, especially where the record demonstrates a need to further stimulate designated entity
participation in spectrum auctions and in the after-market for auctioned services. Before we determine whether
distress sales to designated entities should be authorized, we will evaluate the success of our other measures. We
do not adopt royalties as an alternative payment method for designated entities. Such a procedure would prove extremely
intrusive and difficult to implement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preventing unjust enrichment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If we employ set-asides to benefit some or all of the designated entities, we will impose a recapture provision, applicable
in the event of a sale to a non-designated entity, that would be designed to recoup for the government a portion of the
value of the benefit received by the designated entity in the bidding. Such a recapture provision would require that
licensees seeking to transfer their licenses for profit must within a specified time remit to the government a penalty
equal to a portion of the total value of the benefit conferred by the government. We will generally reduce the penalty
as time passes or construction benchmarks are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50. Any specific recapture provisions will be set forth in competitive bidding rules applicable to any services in
which we decide to set aside licenses. In no event will recapture provisions apply to the transfer or assignment of
a license that has been held for more than five years. If the transfer is made to another eligible designated entity,
there would be no penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51. If a small business making installment payments sells its license to an entity that does not qualify under the standards
we have set for small businesses, we will require payment of the full amount of the remaining principal balance as a
condition of the license transfer. Also, where bidding credits are used, transfer of a license to a non-designated
entity or any action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity,
will require the designated entity to reimburse the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest.

52. This rulemaking proceeding was initiated to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended.
The rules adopted herein will carry out Congress's intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for choosing
from among mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum principally
for the transmission or reception of communications signals to or from subscribers for compensation. The rules adopted
herein also will carry out Congress's intent to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.

instances that applications for modification that are mutually exclusive with other applications should be subject
to competitive bidding;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applications for subsidiary communications services. A ``subsidiary communications service'' is a class of
service where the signal for that service is indivisible from that of the main channel signal and that main channel
signal is exempt from competitive bidding under other provisions of these rules. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;1.2102(c) (exempting broadcast services). Examples of such subsidiary communications services are those
transmitted on subcarriers within the FM baseband signal (see 47 CFR 73.295), and signals transmitted within the
Vertical Blanking Interval of a broadcast television signal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Applications for frequencies used as an intermediate link or links in the provision of a continuous, end-to-end
service were no service is provided directly to subscribers over the frequencies. Examples of such intermediate
links are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Point-to-point microwave facilities used to connect a cellular radio telephone base station with a cellular
radio telephone mobile telephone switching office; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Point-to-point microwave facilities used as part of the service offering in the provision of telephone exchange
or interexchange service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Applications in the following services or classes of services are not subject to competitive bidding:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Alaska-Private Fixed Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, subpart O); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Broadcast radio (AM and FM) and broadcast television (VHF, UHF, LPTV) under 47 CFR part 73;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Broadcast Auxiliary and Cable Television Relay Services (see 47 CFR part 74, subparts D, E, F, G, H and L and part
78, subpart B);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Competitive bidding design options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or
classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The Commission will choose from one or more of the following types
of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to competitive bidding:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sequential oral auctions; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be
used with any type of auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;1.2103,
the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default
on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be
subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the
license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing
bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close
of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (g)(1) of this section plus an
additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid
amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified
bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify
the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that such
penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bidder identification during auctions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During any auction, the Commission may identify bidders and the bids only by bid numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle,
evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that
affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole
discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or
cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form application (FCC Form 175), together with
any appropriate filing fee set forth in public notice. Unless otherwise provided by Public Notice, the Form 175 need
not be accompanied by an upfront payment (see &sect;1.2106).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All Form 175s will be due:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) On the date(s) specified by public notice; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur automatically by operation of law (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 22.902), on a date specified by public notice after the Commission has reviewed the applications that have been
filed on those dates and determined that mutual exclusivity exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Form 175 must contain the following information:

but not limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, identifying all parties with whom the applicant

Modification and Dismissal of Form 175.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Any Form 175 that is not signed or otherwise does not contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this
section is unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected subsequent to any applicable filing deadline. The application
will be dismissed with prejudice and the upfront payment, if paid, will be returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein (except for failure
to sign the application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected application. Form 175 may be amended
or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the application (such as typographical errors). The Commission
will classify all amendments as major or minor, pursuant to rules applicable to specific services. An application
will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after
applicable filing deadlines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applicant who fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by public notice will
have their applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the filing of short-form applications, all bidders are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing
or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies with other bidders until after the high
bidder makes the required down payment, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding
arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application.

Submission of upfront payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment.
In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice.
No interest will be paid on upfront payments. In auctions for licenses set aside pursuant to &sect;1.2110(c), the
Commission may establish lower upfront payments for eligible designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial
institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the
Federal Communications Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to
constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring
it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum
upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made
will be returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder
is the high bidder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to
&sect;1.2104 for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will
be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional payment obligations
that the high bidder may have.

Submission of Down Payment and Filing of Long-Form Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder
must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring
its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its
high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under &sect;1.2103, however, bidders may be required
to submit their down payments with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn
in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated
entities eligible for installment payments under &sect;1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits
up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent
down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. See &sect;1.2110(e) (1) and (2). Down payments
will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the license and has paid the remaining balance
due on the license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee
or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable penalties. No interest will be paid on any down
payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after
being notified that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-form application'') pursuant
to the rules governing the service in which the applicant is the high bidder (unless it has already submitted such an
application, as contemplated by &sect;1.2105(a)(1)(b). For example, if the applicant is a high bidder for a license
in the Interactive Video Data Service (see 47 CFR part 95, subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on
FCC Form 574 in accordance with Section 95.815 of the Rules. Notwithstanding any other provision in title 47 of the
Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with
their long-form applications. Notwithstanding any other provision in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations
to the contrary, the high bidder's long-form application must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office of the Secretary,
Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., room 222, Washington, DC 20554, Attention: Auction Application
Processing Section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form application as required under this subsection, and fails
to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject to the
penalties set forth in &sect;1.2104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must provide a detailed explanation of the terms and
conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement or arrangement
it had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to &sect;1.2105.

Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act or the Commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific
procedures for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the Commission's Rules, the procedures
in this section shall apply to the filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice that a long-form application has been accepted
for filing, petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations
of fact or denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The
times for filing such opposition and replies will be those provided in &sect;1.45.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the Commission determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and material issue of fact concerning that determination,
it will grant the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial issue of fact concerning that determination, the
Commission need not hold an evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit
all or part of the evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other than administrative law judges
to preside at the taking of written evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are required to pay the balance of their winning bids
in a lump sum within five (5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned
on full and timely payment of the winning bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has declared competitive bidding closed or fails to
remit the required down payment within five (5) business days after the Commission has declared competitive bidding
closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the
default penalty specified in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission may either re-auction the license
to existing or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. The
down payment obligations set forth in &sect;1.2107(b) will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the required down payment, will be deemed to
have defaulted and will be liable for the penalty set forth in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission will
conduct another auction for the license, affording new parties an opportunity to file applications for the license.

(b) Definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Small businesses. Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific services, a small business is an entity
that, together with its affiliates, has no more than a $6 million net worth and, after federal income taxes (excluding
any carry over losses), has no more than $2 million in annual profits each year for the previous two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. A business owned by members of minority groups and/or
women is one in which minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and
50.1 percent controlling interest in the applicant. For applicants that are limited partnerships, the general partner
either must be a minority and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who is a U.S. citizen and owns at least 50.1 percent
of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women who are
U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements such
as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control an
entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration
that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority and female principals
of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity, a designated
entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated
on a fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American
Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asian American extraction.

(d) The Commission may permit small businesses, including small businesses owned by women and minorities and rural
telephone companies that qualify as small businesses, that are high bidders for licenses specified by the Commission,
to pay the full amount of their high bids in installments over the term of their licenses pursuant to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Unless otherwise specified, each eligible applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit
by wire transfer or cashier's check in the manner specified in &sect;1.2107(b) sufficient additional funds as are
necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after
the Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit the required payment will
make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to &sect;1.2104(g)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within five (5) business days of the grant of the license application of a winning bidder eligible for installment
payments, the licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby commencing the eligible licensee's
installment payment plan. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant
to &sect;1.2104(g)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment

(ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more installment payments, a licensee may request that the
Commission permit a three to six month grace period, during which no installment payments need be made. In considering
whether to grant a request for a grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the licensee's payment
history, including whether the licensee has defaulted before, how far into the license term the default occurs, the
reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction build-out requirements, the licensee's financial
condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under an authorized distress sale policy. If the Commission
grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a restructured payment schedule, interest will continue
to accrue and will be amortized over the remaining term of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace
period request, or upon default with no such request submitted, the license will automatically cancel and the Commission
will initiate debt collection procedures pursuant to subpart O of this part.

for bidding credits, the licenses for which bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be available only for licenses in rural telephone company
service areas and only if eligible rural telephone companies make an infrastructure build-out commitment beyond
any standard performance requirement. The amount of the bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be based
on the amount by which eligible applicants agree to expand or accelerate the build-out commitment. If a rural telephone
company fails to meet an accelerated or expanded build-out commitment, it must make payment to the Commission within
ninety (90) days of a penalty equal to the amount of the bidding credit. Grant of the license will be conditioned upon
payment of this penalty if and when it becomes applicable.

with its application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the Commission a statement indicating that
its license was obtained through competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission the associated
contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the total consideration
that the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license. This information should
include not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-kind, or other consideration (

As specified in this paragraph (b), an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise
permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor pursuant to a set-aside
for eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(c), or who proposes to take any other action relating to ownership
or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission approval and may
be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Commission by cashier's check or wire transfer before
consent will be granted. The Payment will be based upon a schedule that will take account of the term of the license,
any applicable construction benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-aside benefit, which will be calculated
as the difference between the amount paid by the designated entity for the license and the value of a comparable non-set-aside
license in the free market at the time of the auction. The Commission will establish the amount of the Payment and the
burden will be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No Payment will be required if:

financing available to designated entities under &sect;1.2110(d) will be required to pay the full amount of the remaining
principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. No payment will be required if the proposed transferee or
assignee assumes the installment payment obligations of the transferor or assignor, and if the proposed transferee
or assignee is itself qualified to obtain installment financing under &sect;1.2110(d), and so certifies.

credits available to eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(e), or who proposes to take any other action
relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission
approval and will be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Government by wire transfer or
cashier's check before consent will be granted. The Payment will be the sum of the amount of the bidding credit plus
interest at the rate applicable for installment financing in effect at the time the license was awarded. See &sect;1.2110(e).

By this Supplemental Order, the Commission affirms its decision to adopt the Motorola C-Quam system as the standard
for the stereophonic AM broadcast radio service. On November 23, 1993, the Commission released a Report and Order
implementing the C-Quam AM stereo standard. Subsequent to the release on the Report and Order, it has come to the attention
of the Commission that a number of comments had been inadvertently overlooked. After review of these additional comments,
the Commission finds no new evidence or information that warrants a change in its decision in this matter.

Summary of the Order

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In response to the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 (Authorization Act), the Commission adopted
a Report and Order in this proceeding, 58 FR 66300, December 20, 1993, selecting the C-Quam system as the single AM stereo
transmission standard.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequent to the release of the Report and Order, it was found that twenty comments had inadvertently not been considered.
Most of these comments were improperly or untimely filed. Nevertheless, because other late and improperly filed
comments were considered in the Report and Order, we have elected to consider all of these comments at this time.

2. All of the previously unconsidered comments oppose the Commission's proposed selection of C-Quam as the AM stereo
standard. Most parties generally allege some form of technical superiority of the Kahn system, or conversely, some
technical inferiority of the C-Quam system. Specifically, these parties claim the C-Quam system exhibits technical
flaws, including ``platform motion,'' loss of coverage, and increased adjacent channel interference.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, some commenting parties recommend that additional testing or evaluation be undertaken. Other parties
question the compatibility of C-Quan with future AM band digital audio transmission systems, argue that adopting
a system other than Kahn's as the standard will force them to re-engineer antenna array, or contend that Motorola unfairly
manipulated the marketplace to create its competitive lead.

3. The relative technical performance of the Kahn and C-Quam systems was addressed in the Report and Order, including
specifically the issues of platform motion, coverage area and adjacent channel performance. With regard to platform
motion, we concluded that recent improvements in receiver design mitigate such effects. Modern C-Quam receivers
compensate for platform motion by gradually reducing stereo channel separation as signal-to-noise ratios deteriorate,
creating a smooth transition to monaural operation when signals are weak. Further, as previously noted, such weak
signal effects as platform motion generally occur beyond a station's protected coverage area. Claims of loss of coverage
area and increased adjacent channel interference with C-Quam appear to be based on allegations that the C-Quam signal
must be modulated at lower levels to avoid excessive bandwidth. As stated in the Report and Order, we find no evidence
that currently authorized C-Quam equipment violates the Commission's bandwidth requirements when operated properly.
The additional commenting parties present no new analysis or measurements to support their claims. We further note
that the record contains no complaints of lost coverage from the hundreds of broadcasters currently using the C-Quam
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. With regard to suggestions that further testing and evaluation should be performed, in the Report and Order we noted
that the Motorola and Kahn systems have been tested and comparatively evaluated over the years, and both systems were
found to have technical advantages. As stated, we have no reason to expect that further testing would reveal any new
information. Moreover, any further testing would lead to additional delays and would be inconsistent with the statutory
time restrictions on this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The issue of compatibility with future AM band digital audio broadcast systems was also discussed in the Report
and Order. We noted that there is no reason to believe that either the C-Quam system or the Kahn system would have any
advantage in compatibility with future digital systems. We further observed that, as we have no specific information
on the likely design of such systems, we would not presuppose to consider fairly issues relating to their compatibility
with AM stereo technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. With regard to comments that protest the potential costs associated with re-engineering the antenna arrays to
accommodate C-Quam transmission, we observe that conversion of any station to any AM stereo system, either initially
or from one system to another, will certainly involve re-engineering costs. Commenting parties have not provided
any evidence from which to conclude that the conversion cost to the relatively few stations using the Kahn system outweigh
the benefits to the public of requiring use of the C-Quam system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. We stated in the Report and Order that we were not persuaded that Motorola unfairly manipulated the market to deny
any segment of the industry or the public a free choice. No new information in the additional comments convinces us
otherwise. While vehicular receivers for any system other than C-Quam may indeed be generally unavailable, this
is a result of market choices by vehicle and receiver manufacturers in anticipating the preference of their customers.
We disagree that existing market penetration is inadequate to determine whether a de facto standard exists. As stated
in the Report and Order, we find that there was indeed sufficient convergence in the market place toward C-Quam during
the past twelve years of unrestricted competition between the systems to conclude that the public interest would
be best served by adopting C-Quam as the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. With regard to the comments that the Commission should mandate multiple system receivers, allow systems other
than the standard to be operated on a non-interference basis, or not adopt a standard, we find these positions to be
inconsistent with the Congressional mandate in this matter. Specifically, the Authorization Act requires that
we select a single standard for AM stereo.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In the Report and Order, we determined that stations employing power-side operation are not subject to the provisions
of the stereophonic transmission standard and use of the Kahn system for such operation could continue. Thus, we believe
that the decision made in the Report and Order is responsive to those parties wishing to use the Kahn system for power-side
operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. We remain convinced that the Motorola C-Quam system is the appropriate choice for the AM stereo standard. We find
no arguments in any of the previously unconsidered comments that persuade us to modify any of the decisions previously
adopted in the Report and Order.

On reconsideration, the Commission grants the request of K to Z, Ltd., licensee of Station WGLR-FM, Channel 249A,
Lancaster, Wisconsin, to substitute Channel 249C3 in lieu of Channel 249A at Lancaster, rather than Channel 234C3
allotted to Manchester, Iowa in the Report and Order, 56 FR 56,472, published November 5, 1991, and to modify the license
of Station WGLR-FM accordingly. The Commission substitutes Channel 234A in lieu of Channel 249A at Clinton, Iowa
for Station KCLN (FM), and modifies Station KCLN (FM)'s license accordingly. The Commission also substitutes Channel
274A in lieu of Channel 236A at Morrison, Illinois for Station WZZT (FM), and modifies Station WZZT (FM)'s license
accordingly. The Commission also rescinds both the substitution of Channel 234C3 at Manchester, Iowa and the modification
of Station KMCH's license to reflect that substitution. With this action, the proceeding is terminated. See Supplemental

 This final rule delays until September 1, 1994, the effective date of the requirements in one section of a final rule
issued November 2, 1992, which amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 217, Bus Emergency Exits and Window
Retention and Release, to revise the minimum requirements for school bus emergency exits and improve access to school
bus emergency doors. On March 24, 1994, NHTSA issued an interpretation of the term ``daylight opening'' used in the
final rule. Subsequently, NHTSA has learned that several school bus manufacturers had misunderstood this term and
as a result, will not have designed many of their buses with sufficient exits to comply with the new requirement by the
May 2, 1994 effective date. Because NHTSA agrees that this term could have been misunderstood, NHTSA is allowing manufacturers
to continue certifying their buses as having the exits required prior to the November 2, 1992 final rule until September
1, 1994. All other requirements of the November 2, 1992 final rule will continue to be effective on May 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 15, 1991, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend Standard No. 217 to require
that the minimum number of emergency exits on school buses be based upon the seating capacity of the school bus (56 FR
11153). Under the proposal, all school buses would have been required to have either a rear emergency exit door or a
side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window. Depending on capacity, some school buses would have been required
to have additional exits. The NPRM proposed two options regarding the means for providing the additional emergency
exits. Option A would have required the use of emergency exit doors. Option B would have required a combination of emergency
exit doors and emergency roof exits. The NPRM included a table indicating the additional exits required under each
option for any bus with a designated seating capacity between 24 and 90. The determination of the number and type of
exits used in the tables was based on crediting an emergency exit door with its minimum area (24 inches &times; 45 inches,
or 1,080 inches2) and crediting two emergency roof exits as a single emergency exit door. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule increasing the amount of emergency exit area required on school buses
(57 FR 49413). As in the proposal, the final rule required that the minimum emergency exit area on school buses be based
upon the seating capacity of the school bus. However, the final rule differed from the NPRM concerning the calculation
by which the need for additional emergency exits was to be determined. (On December 2, 1992 NHTSA published a technical
amendment to the November 2, 1992 final rule. Both of these notices will be referred to collectively as the November
2, 1992 final rule.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 2, 1992 final rule specified that after calculating the total amount of additional emergency exit area
[AEEA] needed for a school bus, using the formula proposed in the NPRM, each exit was to be credited with its ``daylight
opening.'' ``Daylight opening'' was defined as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit when viewed
from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' The preamble to the final rule did not include a further
discussion of what might constitute an obstruction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 8, 1994, Mr. Bob Carver of Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (Wayne) wrote to the agency requesting clarification
of the terms ``daylight opening'' and ``unobstructed opening.'' The Wayne letter included Figure 5C from the November
2, 1992 final rule. This figure illustrates the permitted placement of a seat adjacent to a side emergency exit door.
Wayne stated that agency personnel had indicated that only the area visually obstructed by the seat could not be credited,
and requested confirmation of this interpretation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency's response, dated March 24, 1994, did not agree with this interpretation. The March 24 letter states, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``daylight opening'' is defined in the Final Rule as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit
when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' An obstruction in this context would include
any obstacle or object that would block, obscure, or interfere with, in any way, access to that exit when opened. In
determining the ``maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit,'' we would subtract, from the total area of
the opening, the area of any portions of the opening that cannot be used for exit purposes as a result of the obstruction.
The area measurements would be taken when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the particular illustration included with the Wayne letter, the March 24 letter states that the area
forward of the seat back and leg would be considered obstructed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 20, 1994, Mr. Thomas D. Turner of Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) wrote to the agency regarding the March
24 letter. The Blue Bird letter states, ``(w)e believed and were told (by agency personnel) that the definition of
`daylight opening' applied to the exit opening itself and did not involve access to the exit opening.'' The Blue Bird
letter also notes that additional interpretations will be needed to address obstructions at rear emergency exit
doors, emergency exit windows, and the front service door. Blue Bird requested that the agency suspend enforcement
until either (1) a final rule is issued in connection with a December 1, 1993 NPRM which proposed two alternative means
of determining the maximum credit of emergency exits or (2) September 1, 1994. Blue Bird stated that this would allow
sufficient time to resolve these issues and make any necessary changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, Mr. Turner met with agency to further explain the scope of the problem for Blue Bird. In this meeting,
Mr. Turner explained that the confusion resulted in part because the term ``daylight opening'' is used differently
from the November 2 final rule definition in other contexts. The alternate definition is consistent with Blue Bird's
understanding of the term prior to the March 24, 1994 letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 27, 1994, Ms. Jane L. Dawson of Thomas Built Buses (Thomas Built) wrote to the agency to request a delay of the
effective date of the November 2, 1992 final rule. Thomas Built stated that the March 24, 1994 letter ``differs drastically
from the general interpretation of the school bus industry.'' Thomas Built also stated that one effect of the March
24 letter was the need for additional interpretations regarding other emergency exits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interpreting the term ``daylight opening'' either as any area not visually obstructed or as the entire area of the
exit opening, results in crediting some exits with more exit area than the agency intended. On some buses, this would
result in an incorrect determination that either no additional exits or fewer additional exits are required. For
example, if a rear emergency exit door is credited with greater area than allowed, a manufacturer may have determined
that no additional exits were required. On other buses, the manufacturer may have determined that only an additional
side emergency exit door was required. However, if the required exits and the additional side emergency exit door
are credited with greater area than allowed, this determination would be incorrect and an additional emergency roof
exit may also be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that the term ``daylight opening,'' without clarifying explanation, is arguably ambiguous,
in that it leaves open the question of whether an ``obstruction'' is a visual obstruction or a physical obstruction.
This is the issue resolved by the agency's March 24, 1994 letter to Wayne. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than penalize manufacturers that utilized the alternative interpretation, at significant cost to them,
NHTSA has decided to allow manufacturers the option of complying with the previous requirements regarding the number
and type of exits required for a school bus until September 1, 1994. That is, until September 1, 1994, manufacturers
can install either a rear emergency exit door or a side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to Blue Bird's request to suspend enforcement until a final rule is issued for the December 1, 1993, NPRM,
NHTSA has determined that such a delay is not warranted. Each of the options proposed in the December 1, 1993 NPRM would
further limit the amount of area that can be credited for an emergency exit. Because any final rule consistent with
the proposals in the December 1, 1993 NPRM would require vehicle redesign, additional leadtime would be necessary
after publication of such a final rule. Therefore, NHTSA has determined that suspension of the November 2, 1992 final
rule until the rulemaking proceeding for the December 1, 1993 NPRM is final would unnecessarily delay the safety benefits
of the November 2, 1992 final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that the safety effects of an extension to September 1, 1994 will be minimal. The November 2, 1992 final
rule required additional exits on some school buses. The confusion about the amount of area credited for each exit
has resulted in some school buses having fewer exits than the agency expected under the November 2, 1992 final rule.
However, many of these school buses have been redesigned to have more exits than required prior to the November 2, 1992
final rule. The agency expects that manufacturers will not revert to prior designs during the extension period. Therefore,
much of the anticipated benefits of the final rule will be retained during this time period. In addition, the length
of the extension period is short. Therefore, NHTSA anticipates minimal loss of safety benefits as a result of this
extension.

By contrast, the economic effects of denying manufacturers' requests to delay the effective date would be significant.
Most of the school buses which are currently being manufactured or which will be manufactured during the extension
period have already been ordered. Because it is common practice to order school buses by competitive bidding, manufacturers
will have to sell these school buses at the price quoted when ordered. If a manufacturer based the price on installing
fewer exits than required to comply with Standard No. 217, the manufacturer would have to absorb the cost. In addition,
if an extension were not granted, manufacturers would have to stop production until changes could be made to designs,
which could take several months.

NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning

regulatory policies and procedures. As explained above, this notice merely extends the effective date of the final
rule of November 2, 1992, which amended Standard 217. There will be no additional costs associated with this final
rule. Rather, this final rule extends the date of compliance with the amendments of Standard 217 to September 1, 1994.

This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State
may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the
Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies
only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS establishes fishery management measures for the ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California
for 1994. Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and area. The measures establish fishing areas, seasons,
quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum
lengths for salmon taken in the exclusive economic zone (3&hyph;200 nautical miles) off Washington, Oregon, and
California. These management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably
among non-treaty commercial and recreational and treaty Indian fisheries. The regulations also are calculated
to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries.
This action also announces a technical amendment codifying the spawning escapement goal for Klamath Fall chinook.
NMFS also announces 1995 recreational salmon seasons opening earlier than May 1, 1995.

The ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under a ``framework'' fishery management
plan (FMP). The framework FMP was approved in 1984 and has been amended five times since then (52 FR 4146, February 10,
1987; 53 FR 30285, August 11, 1988; 54 FR 19185, May 4, 1989; 56 FR 26774, June 11, 1991; [Amendment 11 approved 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
4/6/94 final rule is being published within days of these annual management measures]). Regulations at 50 CFR part
661 provide the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments to the management measures, within limits
set by the FMP, by notification in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These management measures for the 1994 ocean salmon fisheries were recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management
Council (Council) at its April 5&hyph;8, 1994, meeting.

In accordance with the FMP, the Council's Salmon Technical Team (STT) and staff economist prepared several reports
for the Council, its advisors, and the public. The first report, ``Review of 1993 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' summarizes
the 1993 ocean salmon fisheries and assesses how well the Council's management objectives were met in 1993. The second
report, ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' provides the 1994 salmon
stock abundance projections and analyzes the impacts on the stocks and Council management goals if the 1993 regulations
or regulatory procedures were applied to the 1994 stock abundance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met on March 8&hyph;11, 1994, in Portland, OR, to develop proposed management options for 1994. Three
commercial and three recreational fishery management options were proposed for analysis and public comment. These
options presented various combinations of management measures designed to protect numerous weak stocks of coho
and chinook salmon and provide for ocean harvests of more abundant stocks of chinook salmon (primarily Sacramento
Fall chinook). All options provided for no directed harvest of coho salmon coastwide and no non-treaty commercial
or recreational fishing north of Cape Falcon, OR. After the March Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared
a third report, ``Preseason Report II Analysis of Proposed Regulatory Options for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,''
which analyzes the effects of the proposed 1994 management options. This report also was distributed to the Council,
its advisors, and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings on the proposed options were held March 28&hyph;30, 1994, in Westport, WA; Warrenton and Coos Bay,
OR; and Arcata, CA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met on April 5&hyph;8, 1994, in Burlingame, California, to adopt its final 1994 recommendations. Following
the April Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared a fourth report, ``Preseason Report III Analysis
of Council-Adopted Management Measures for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' which analyzes the environmental and
socio-economic effects of the Council's final recommendations. This report also was distributed to the Council,
its advisors, and the public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many salmon runs returning to Washington, Oregon, and California streams in 1994 are expected to be at record low levels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary resource concerns are for Klamath River fall chinook; Columbia River hatchery chinook; Oregon Production
Index area coho stocks destined for the Columbia River and the California and Oregon coasts, particularly Oregon
coastal natural coho; and Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho. Management of all of these stocks is affected
by interjurisdictional agreements among tribal, State, Federal, and/or Canadian managers.

Chinook Salmon Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
California Central Valley stocks are relatively abundant compared to the other chinook stocks of the Pacific coast.
The Central Valley Index of abundance of combined Central Valley chinook stocks is estimated to be 503,000 fish for
1994, slightly above the post-season estimate of the index for 1993 and 18 percent below the average of the index from
1970&hyph;1993. The escapement goal range of 122,000 to 180,000 Sacramento River adult fall chinook was not met in
1990, 1991, or 1992, and was near the low end of the goal range in 1993. Preseason modeling predicted that regulations
comparable to those of 1993 would result in an escapement of Sacramento River fall chinook within the escapement goal
range in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Winter-run chinook from the Sacramento River are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as an endangered species
(59 FR 440, January 4, 1994) and are a consideration in establishing ocean fishing regulations. The 1993 spawning
run size estimate totaled 341 adults, a substantial decline from the 1992 run-size estimate of 1,180 adults. The abundance
of the winter run in the ocean at the beginning of the fishing season is not forecast.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Klamath River fall chinook ocean abundance is expected to be 137,600 age-3 and age-4 fish at the beginning of the fishing
season. This forecast is 16 percent below last year's actual abundance, and 58 percent below the average of estimates
for 1985&hyph;1993. The spawning escapement goal for Klamath River fall chinook is 33&hyph;34 percent of the potential
adults with a minimum of 35,000 natural spawners (wild run salmon or fish that spawn independent of hatcheries). Although
ocean escapement to the Klamath River (in-river run size) in 1993 was the largest recorded since 1989, the natural
spawning escapement of 20,900 adults fell short of the goal of 38,000, set in 1993 by emergency action by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary), and was below the FMP's minimum natural spawner requirement of 35,000 for a fourth consecutive
year. Preseason modeling predicted that harvest regulations similar to those adopted in 1993 would result in an ocean
escapement that would not be sufficient to achieve the minimum spawning escapement floor and to provide for in-river
sport and Indian tribal fisheries in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years of low abundance, the procedures used to model the Klamath fall chinook population have consistently
overestimated stock abundance and underestimated the hatchery component of the spawning run. In 1994, the Council
implemented changes in the predictor used to forecast age-3 ocean abundance and developed a new predictor of the relative
sizes of the natural and hatchery spawning escapements. As a result, the 1994 forecast of the adult ocean population
is 11 percent smaller, and the spawning escapement (hatchery and natural) required to achieve the natural spawner
floor is 36 percent greater than would have been predicted using the previous methodology. The new predictor is considered
to reflect more accurately the actual ocean abundance and proportion of natural and hatchery stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, as authorized at 50 CFR part 661, Appendix IV.B., the Council recommended, and the Secretary approved, a change
in the Klamath River fall chinook spawning escapement rate goal from 35 percent to between 33 and 34 percent (54 FR 19800,
May 8, 1989). That change was not codified at the time. The change in the spawning escapement rate goal is herein codified

Oregon coastal chinook stocks include south-migrating and localized stocks primarily from southern Oregon streams,
and north-migrating chinook stocks that generally originate in central and northern Oregon streams. Abundance
of south-migrating and localized stocks is expected to be low, similar to the levels observed in 1993. These stocks
are important contributors to ocean fisheries off Oregon and northern California. The generalized expectation
for north-migrating stocks is for a continuation of average to above-average abundance as observed in recent years.
These stocks contribute primarily to ocean fisheries off British Columbia and Alaska. It is expected that the aggregate
Oregon coastal chinook spawning escapement goal of 150,000 to 200,000 naturally spawning adults will be met in 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates of Columbia River chinook abundance vary by stock as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upper Columbia River spring and summer chinook. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numbers of upriver spring chinook predicted to return to the river (49,000) in 1994 are 56 percent below the 1993 run
size of 111,500 fish, and 13 percent below the 1979&hyph;1984 average of 56,600 fish. The 1994 depressed stock status
reflects a substantial decline from recent improvements (1985&hyph;1990 and 1992&hyph;1993) in the status of this
stock. The 1985&hyph;1990 and 1992&hyph;1993 increases from the poor returns in the early 1980s are primarily the
result of increases of hatchery stocks. The natural stock component remains depressed. Ocean escapement is expected
to be significantly below the goal of 115,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver spring chinook are affected
only slightly by ocean harvests in Council area fisheries, with the contribution of these stocks being generally
1 percent or less of the total chinook catch north of Cape Falcon, OR. Expected ocean escapement of adult upriver summer
chinook is 15,700 fish. The 1994 stock status remains extremely depressed, with ocean escapement being about 20 percent
of the lower end of the spawning escapement goal range of 80,000 to 90,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver
summer chinook migrate to the far north and are not a major contributor to ocean fisheries off Washington and Oregon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Willamette River Spring Chinook. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Willamette River spring chinook returns are projected to be 72,000 fish, 15 percent above the 1993 run of 62,600 fish,
and 11 percent greater than the 1980&hyph;1984 average return of 65,000 fish. Willamette River spring chinook stocks
are important contributors to Council area fishery catches north of Cape Falcon.

Columbia River Fall Chinook. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four distinct fall chinook stock units initially were identified, and recently a fifth stock unit has been added,
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Upriver bright fall chinook ocean escapement is expected to be 85,400 adults, 17 percent below the 1993 return
of 102,900 adults, and 7 percent above the 1981&hyph;1985 period of poor returns that averaged 79,500 adults. The
escapement goal for upriver bright fall chinook is 40,000 adults above McNary Dam. This stock has a northern ocean
migratory pattern and constitutes less than 10 percent of Council-area fisheries north of Cape Falcon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Lower river natural fall chinook ocean escapement is forecast at about 14,700 adults, 10 percent above the 1993
run size of 13,400. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Lower river hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is forecast at 36,100 adults, a 31 percent reduction from the
record low return observed in 1993 of 52,200 adults. This stock has been declining sharply since the record high return
in 1987. Lower Columbia River fall chinook stocks normally account for more than half the total catch in Council-area
fisheries north of Cape Falcon, with lower river hatchery fall chinook being the single largest contributing stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Spring Creek hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is projected to be about 20,200 adults, 20 percent above the
1993 return of 16,800 adults; the 1986&hyph;1990 average ocean escapement was 16,700 adults. The Spring Creek hatchery
fall chinook stock has been rebuilding slowly since the record low return in 1987, with a downturn in 1992 and 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Mid-Columbia bright fall chinook ocean escapement is projected to be about 23,900 adults, 13 percent below the
1993 return of 27,400 adults. These fall chinook are returns primarily from hatchery releases of bright fall chinook
stock in the area below McNary Dam, although some natural spawning in tributaries between Bonneville and McNary dams
is also occurring.

Coho Salmon Stocks

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Oregon Production Index (OPI) is an annual index of coho abundance from Leadbetter Point, WA, south through California.
It is the primary index of coho abundance for the Pacific ocean fishery. Oregon coastal and Columbia River coho stocks
are the primary components of the OPI. Beginning in 1988, the Council adopted revised estimation procedures that
were expected more accurately to predict abundance of the following individual OPI area stock components: public
hatchery, private hatchery, Oregon coastal natural (OCN) for rivers and lakes, and the Salmon Trout Enhancement
Program. Prediction methodologies are described in the Council's ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis
for 1988 Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' In response to the extremely low abundances expected in 1994, some changes to the
abundance predictors were implemented as described in the Council's ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis
for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' In particular, the current predictor for the OCN river component does not adequately
incorporate environmental variability, so an environment-based model is being used to predict abundance in 1994.
This model incorporates annual measurements of upwelling and sea surface temperatures and contains no provision
for the influence of spawner escapement. Further analysis of this model will occur before the 1995 season. The 1994
OPI is forecast to be a record low 239,700 coho, 69 percent below the 1993 preseason forecast of 767,000 coho, and 49
percent below the 1993 observed level of 470,900 fish. The 1994 estimate includes a record low of 140,900 OCN coho,
44 percent below the 1993 observed level of 250,800 fish and 27 percent below the previous record low of 192,500 fish
observed in 1987. The 1993 spawning escapement of the OCN stock was 170,200 fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocks are expected to be less abundant than forecast in 1993.
Abundances for Washington coastal stocks of Hoh, Queets, and Grays Harbor natural coho are projected to be 40 percent,
47 percent, and about 60 percent below the 1993 preseason predictions, respectively. Abundances for Puget Sound
stocks of Skagit, Stillaguamish, and Hood Canal natural coho are projected to be 45 percent, 65 percent, and 72 percent
below the 1993 preseason predictions, respectively. Even in the absence of ocean and inside (Strait of Juan de Fuca
and Puget Sound) fisheries, natural coho run sizes are forecast to be well below spawning escapement goals. These
low expected abundances are thought to be the result of low freshwater flows in 1992, poor marine survival associated
with anomalous ocean conditions, and long-term habitat degradation. Abundance forecasts for Washington coastal
and Puget Sound hatchery production are also well below 1993 expectations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the area south of Cape Falcon, the management measures in this rule are based primarily on concerns for Klamath River
fall chinook, Sacramento River winter chinook, and OCN coho. The greatest constraint on the ocean management measures
was the record low abundance of OCN coho as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council recommended measures that result in the harvest of Klamath River fall chinook being shifted predominantly
southward off California, to maximize access to abundant Central Valley chinook stocks. Management constraints
on Klamath River fall chinook resulted in restrictive fishing seasons in the area between Humbug Mountain, OR, and
Horse Mountain, CA, termed the Klamath Management Zone (KMZ), as well as in the areas both north and south of the KMZ.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary issued a final rule (58 FR 68063, December 23, 1993) recognizing the Federally-reserved fishing rights
of the Yurok and Hoopa Valley Tribes, as acknowledged and quantified in an opinion issued by the Solicitor, Department
of the Interior, as other applicable law for the purposes of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(Magnuson Act). The 1994 management measures provide for an ocean exploitation rate on age-4 Klamath fall chinook
of 9 percent. This restriction of ocean harvest is required to provide equal sharing of the harvest of Klamath River
fall chinook between the Tribes and non-Indian fishermen, as set out in the Solicitor's opinion, as well as to meet
the spawning escapement goal floor of 35,000 natural adult spawners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Winter-run chinook from the Sacramento River are listed under the ESA as an endangered species. In 1991, NMFS concluded
a formal consultation with the Council regarding the impacts of the ocean salmon fishing regulations on the winter
run. The biological opinion issued from that consultation determined that the 1990 level of impacts from the ocean
fisheries would not jeopardize the continued existence of the winter run. NMFS also recommended shortening the recreational
fishing season off central California and closure of an area at the mouth of San Francisco Bay during the time when the
winter run fish are entering the Bay. These recommended conservation measures were implemented in 1991 and remain
a part of the salmon management measures for 1994. The overall impact of the 1994 salmon management program on the winter
run is expected to be significantly less than in 1990, the base year for the biological opinion. This expectation is
based on the harvest rate model for the Central Valley Index stocks of fall chinook, which predicts a harvest rate of
53 percent in 1994, as compared to 79 percent in 1990. These rates are only indicators of the relative impact on the winter
run, because these fish are less vulnerable to the ocean fisheries than fall-run chinook, due to the timing of the seasons,
as well as growth and migration patterns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under recently approved Amendment 11 to the FMP, the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho is 42 spawners per mile in
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's ``standard'' coastal index survey areas. This translates to a maximum
sustainable yield (MSY) goal of 200,000 spawners. At lower abundance levels, only incidental impacts, rather than
directed OCN coho fisheries, are allowed. When the predicted spawner escapement is less than or equal to 28 spawners
per mile (which translates to 135,000 spawners), the FMP allows an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent,
but only if it is the minimum incidental harvest necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and will not cause irreparable
harm to the OCN stock (135,000 spawners was the spawning escapement floor under the FMP prior to approval of Amendment
11; 200,000 spawners is the spawning escapement floor established by Amendment 11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 abundance estimate for OCN coho is for a record low of 140,900 fish. At this abundance level, the FMP only allows
a minimum incidental harvest that will not cause irreparable harm to the stock. The 1994 management measures result
in a total OCN coho exploitation rate of only 11 percent, of which about 6.4 percent are impacts associated with prosecution
of Council area fisheries and about 4.6 percent are impacts associated with non-Council-managed directed fisheries
(Canadian, Alaskan, and inside fisheries). Based on these measures, OCN coho spawning escapement is estimated to
be 125,500 adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, has determined that the recommended harvest rate will not cause irreparable
harm to the OCN coho salmon stock for several reasons. First, the 1993 spawning escapement goal was achieved, although
the geographic distribution of spawners was not optimal. As a result of achieving the spawning escapement goal in
1993, the resulting production of many individual stocks in 1996 should return to normal levels, if ocean survival
conditions also return to normal. Second, under the 1994 fishing regime (no coho retention), spawning escapement
is projected to be 125,500 fish. This level of escapement, although not optimal because it is less than the 200,000
MSY escapement goal, is not at such a low level that OCN coho stocks cannot recover when ocean survival conditions improve.
Of greatest concern are specific individual stocks within the OCN complex, such as Tillamook Bay stocks, that have
exhibited extremely poor spawning escapements in recent years. However, the predominantly southern distribution
of the chinook harvest, the prohibition of coho retention in all chinook-only fisheries, and the extreme measures
being imposed by the states in internal waters to protect coho salmon that return to individual watersheds, makes
it unlikely that the ocean salmon fishing regime in 1994 will cause irreparable harm to any OCN coho salmon stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has also considered whether the 11 percent incidental harvest rate is the minimum necessary to prosecute other
fisheries. Because the bycatch in non-salmon fisheries, such as the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery, is almost
exclusively chinook salmon, the bycatch of coho salmon in non-salmon fisheries is not a large concern. The Council
determined that harvestable numbers of Central Valley and Klamath River fall chinook stocks warranted a chinook
fishery on these stocks. In order to minimize the impacts on OCN coho salmon during these chinook fisheries, the Council
recommended, and NMFS provides in this action that no coho retention be allowed. Thus the only mortality to coho salmon
will be the result of hooking mortality from chinook fishing. In addition, the Council adjusted the geographic distribution
of the fisheries so that the majority of chinook fishing occurs to the south, primarily off California, where the catch
of OCN coho is the lowest. The Council recommended this geographic shift to the South to protect coho. However, this
shift occurs at the expense of Oregon fishermen, who now will not have the opportunity to harvest as large a proportion
of Klamath River fall chinook stocks as they might have absent coho conservation concerns. Finally, the States of
Oregon and Washington have closed the Columbia River Buoy 10 fishery for coho salmon, and Oregon has taken additional
restrictive actions in estuarine and freshwater fisheries to minimize the impacts of fishing on OCN coho. Based on
these actions, NMFS believes that the 11 percent ocean and freshwater harvest rate is the minimum harvest rate necessary
to prosecute other fisheries.

Retention of coho salmon is prohibited in all areas due to the projected record low coho abundance. All seasons listed

North of Cape Falcon

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the projected record low returns for Washington coastal coho, Puget Sound natural and hatchery coho stocks,
and Oregon coastal and Columbia River coho, unprecedented action is being taken to close the non-treaty commercial
troll and recreational ocean fisheries north of Cape Falcon in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocks are expected to be less abundant than forecast in 1993.
Numbers of coho entering freshwater are either below spawner escapement goals (Queets, Grays Harbor, Skagit, Stillaguamish,
and Hood Canal natural coho) or at the lower end of the spawner escapement goal range (Quillayute Falls and Hoh natural
coho). These low expected abundances are the result of low flows in 1992, poor marine survival associated with anomalous
ocean conditions, and long-term habitat degradation. Abundance forecasts for Washington coastal and Puget Sound
hatchery production are also well below 1993 expectations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even in the absence of ocean salmon fisheries north of Cape Falcon, the Council wanted to ensure that the impacts on
Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook stocks, which are listed as threatened species under the ESA, did not exceed
recent years' levels of impacts. For Snake River wild spring chinook, the available information indicates that it
is highly unlikely these fish are impacted in Council-area fisheries. For Snake River wild summer chinook, these
fish comprise only a very small proportion of total chinook abundance in the Council management area, and it is unlikely
these fish are significantly impacted in Council-area fisheries. For Snake River wild fall chinook that are caught
in Council-area fisheries, the STT estimated significant reductions in the ocean exploitation rate under the Council's
recommended 1994 ocean measures compared to the 1986&hyph;1990 average by using the Lyons Ferry Hatchery stock to
represent Snake River wild fall chinook. These reductions in the ocean exploitation rate total over 90 percent for
north of Cape Falcon and 80 percent for combined north and south of Cape Falcon.

In 1994, treaty Indian troll fisheries north of Cape Falcon are governed by a quota of 16,400 chinook, with no retention
of coho. The all-except-coho seasons will open May 1 and extend through June 30, if the chinook quota is not reached.
The minimum length restrictions for all treaty ocean fisheries, excluding ceremonial and subsistence harvest,
is 24 in. (61 cm) for chinook.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The timing of the March and April Council meetings makes it impracticable for the Council to recommend fishing seasons
to the Secretary that begin before May 1 of the same year. Therefore, openings earlier than May 1 for 1995 fishing seasons
are being provided for at this time. The Council recommended, and the Secretary concurs, that the following recreational
seasons will open in 1995: (1) The area from Point Arena to the U.S.-Mexico border will open on the nearest Saturday
to March 1 for all salmon with a two-fish daily bag limit, except for closure of the control zone near the mouth of San
Francisco Bay from the opening of the season through March 31; and (2) the area from Horse Mountain to Point Arena will
open on the nearest Saturday to February 15 for all salmon with a two-fish daily bag limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following tables and text are the management measures recommended by the Council for 1994 and, as specified, for
1995. The Secretary concurs with these recommendations and finds them responsive to the goals of the FMP, the requirements
of the resource, and the socio-economic factors affecting resource users. The management measures are consistent
with requirements of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law, including U.S. obligations to Indian Tribes with
treaty-secured fishing rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following management measures are adopted for 1994 and, as specified, for 1995 under 50 CFR part 661.

Troll Fishing Gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Troll fishing gear for the Fishery Management Area (FMA) is defined as one or more lines that drag hooks behind a moving
fishing vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line or lines must be affixed to the vessel and must not be intentionally
disengaged from the vessel at any time during the fishing operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recreational Fishing Gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recreational fishing gear for the FMA is defined as angling tackle consisting of a line with not more than one artificial
lure or natural bait attached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line must be attached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely
attended; the rod and reel must be held by hand while playing a hooked fish. No person may use more than one rod and line
while fishing off Oregon or Washington. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that portion of the FMA off California, the line must be attached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely attended.
Weights directly attached to a line may not exceed 4 pounds (1.8 kg). There is no limit to the number of lines that a person
may use while recreational fishing for salmon off California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing includes any activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of
fish.

Inseason Notice Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Actual notice of inseason management actions will be provided by a telephone hotline administered by the Northwest
Region, NMFS, 206&hyph;526&hyph;6667 or 800&hyph;662&hyph;9825, and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts.
These broadcasts are announced on Channel 16 VHF&hyph;FM and 2182 Khz at frequent intervals. The announcements designate
the channel or frequency over which the Notice to Mariners will be immediately broadcast. Inseason actions will also
be filed with the Office of the Federal Register as soon as practicable. Since provisions of these management measures
may be altered by inseason actions, fishermen should monitor either the telephone hotline or Coast Guard broadcasts
for current information for the area in which they are fishing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notification of annual management measures and technical amendment are exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 661.23 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations states that the Secretary will publish a notice establishing
management measures for ocean salmon each year and will invite public comments prior to their effective date. If the
Secretary determines, for good cause, that a notice must be issued without affording prior opportunity for public
comment, the measures will become effective, however, comments on the notice will be received by the Secretary for
a period of 15 days after the filing of the notice with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many ocean salmon seasons are scheduled to start May 1, the management measures must be in effect by this date.
Each year the schedule for establishing the annual management measures begins in February with the compilation and
analysis of biological and socioeconomic data for the previous year's fishery and salmon stock abundance estimates
for the current year. Two meetings of the Council follow in March and April which incorporate a public review period.
In 1994, the Council recommended management measures at the conclusion of its meeting on April 8, resulting in a short
time frame for implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, delay in the start of the fishing season would deny ocean fishermen access to harvestable salmon stocks
which, if taken later in the year, would produce unacceptable impacts on other salmon stocks, such as those listed
under the ESA. Due to the migratory patterns of the various salmon stocks, harvest regimes account for the timing and
location of harvestable stocks in concert with the stocks of concern. Therefore, in light of the limited available
time and the adverse effect of delay, the Secretary has determined that good cause exists to waive prior notice and
comment on the management measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this document will be effective without prior opportunity for comment, the public had opportunity to comment
on these management measures during the process of their development. The public participated in the March and April
Council, STT, and Salmon Advisory Subpanel meetings, and in public hearings held in Washington, Oregon, and California
in late March that generated the management actions recommended by the Council and approved by the Secretary. Written
public comments were invited by the Council between the March and April Council meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical amendment provisions of this regulatory action make only minor, non-substantive changes and do not
change operating practices in the fishery. Accordingly, it is unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to provide for
prior public comment, and there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) not to delay the effective date of the technical
amendment for 30 days. Comments will be accepted for 15 days after the effective date of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion that considered the effects of the FMP on Sacramento River winter-run
chinook salmon. The opinion concluded that implementation of the plan is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the species. The 1994 season falls within the scope of the 1991 opinion, and the seasons and management measures
comply with the recommendations and incidental take conditions contained in the biological opinion. Therefore,
it was not necessary to reinitiate consultation on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has issued a biological opinion that considered the effects of the 1994 salmon management measures on wild sockeye
salmon, wild spring/summer chinook salmon, and wild fall chinook salmon from the Snake River, which concluded the
fishery in 1994 under the FMP is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed stocks.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary of Commerce issues this final rule to implement Amendment 11 (Amendment) to the Fishery Management
Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (FMP).
The Amendment modifies the spawning escapement goal for Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho salmon and the criteria
for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, OR.
The Amendment is intended to: (1) Address persistent low OCN coho stock abundance and annual escapement goals below
maximum sustainable yield (MSY), (2) prevent imbalances in recreational coho harvest allocation at low allowable
harvest levels, and (3) prevent the frequent use of emergency rulemaking to implement annual management measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ocean salmon fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the United States (3 to 200 miles offshore) in the Pacific
Ocean off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under the FMP. The FMP was developed by the Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Magnuson Act), and approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in 1978. Since then, the FMP has been amended
10 times, with implementing regulations codified at 50 CFR part 661. From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually.
In 1984, a framework amendment was implemented that provided the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments
in the regulations without annual amendments. Amendments to the framework FMP were implemented in 1987, 1988, 1989,
and 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council prepared the Amendment to the FMP and submitted it to the Secretary for approval under the provisions of
the Magnuson Act. On January 10, 1994, the Secretary began formal review of the Amendment. A notice of availability
and a proposed rule were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3327), and February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4895), respectively. The preamble for the proposed rule
discussed the rationale for the proposed amendment. The comment period on the Amendment ended March 10, and on the
proposed rule March 21, 1994; two written comments were received. The Amendment was approved on April 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As implemented by this final rule, the Amendment modifies the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho salmon. The OCN
coho stock is composed of naturally produced coho salmon from Oregon coastal streams. OCN coho are important contributors
to the ocean harvest, as the stock aggregate constitutes the largest component of naturally produced coho caught
in ocean salmon fisheries off Oregon and California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified escapement goal is intended to achieve an aggregate OCN adult spawning density of 42 naturally spawning
adults per mile in standard index survey areas each year. The standard index survey areas are 48 different stream sections
that have been surveyed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) each year since 1950. Under the current
methods used by ODFW, the spawners in the standard index area are extrapolated for 4,764 miles of coastal spawning
habitat. This translates to a numerical spawning escapement goal of 200,000. The original FMP spawning escapement
goal of 200,000 was based on this extrapolation. This number of adult spawners per mile was documented as the estimated
MSY spawning escapement level in an ODFW study of coastal stream spawning escapements and subsequent production
from 1950 to 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendment also provides that when OCN coho abundance is forecast to be less than 125 percent of the annual numerical
escapement goal, or below 250,000 fish at the present spawner escapement goal of 200,000 adults, an incidental exploitation
rate of up to 20 percent will be allowed for ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting on non-OCN coho salmon stocks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the predicted OCN coho spawning escapement is 28 or less adults per mile in standard index areas, the Council may
allow only an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent. The Council will evaluate the actual level of incidental
harvest of OCN coho that might be expected to occur in fisheries for chinook salmon and non-OCN coho salmon and will
recommend only the minimum incidental harvest rate necessary to prosecute other fisheries, provided that that rate
will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN coho stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendment also modifies the criteria for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho
salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, OR, when the allowable recreational coho allocation for the entire area is equal
to or less than 167,000 fish. The Amendment establishes two subareas with independent impact quotas to ensure that
a large southward shift in the recreational harvest does not occur. Of the total recreational allocation, the subarea
from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain, Oregon, receives 70 percent and the subarea south of Humbug Mountain receives
30 percent, the purpose being to avoid large deviations from historical harvest shares. The two subareas will be managed
for their respective impact quotas; the recreational fisheries for coho salmon in each area may be closed upon attainment
of the quota except for the area south of Point Arena, California (38
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;57
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.). South of Humbug Mountain, there are two additional conditions: (1) An impact guideline of 3 percent
of the overall recreational allocation south of Cape Falcon will be applied from Horse Mountain to Point Arena, California;
and (2) the recreational fishery for coho salmon will not be closed south of Point Arena, even if the fishery between
Humbug Mountain and Point Arena is closed, upon projected attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota;
but the projected harvest through the end of the year will be included in the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.
Quota transfers between subareas are allowed on a one-for-one basis, but only if chinook constraints preclude access
to coho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its March 8&hyph;11, 1994, meeting the Council considered and adopted management options for annual ocean salmon
fisheries under the assumption that the Amendment and its implementing regulations would be in place when coastwide
ocean salmon fishing seasons open on May 1, 1994, as regularly scheduled. During this meeting, the Council clarified
its intent regarding the fishing allowed when the spawner escapement is less than or equal to 28 coho per mile in the
standard index areas. Under the existing plan, no fishing would have been allowed at that level of spawner escapement.
This is a standard that is more restrictive than under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which allows some incidental
take of listed stocks. Therefore, the Amendment will allow an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent that
will provide only the minimum incidental harvest necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances
will cause irreparable harm to the OCN coho stock. This standard of the minimum incidental harvest and no irreparable
harm replaces other allocative measures in the plan regarding OCN coho at spawner escapement levels at or below 28
spawners per mile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the Amendment requires changes to the regulatory language in the Appendix to 50 CFR part 661. The
only change to the proposed regulations published on February 2, 1994, clarifies this issue of allocation at low spawner
levels by adding language in paragraph 2(b)(i) of Appendix section II.B.

The spawning escapement goal proposed in the Amendment and the proposed rule does not adequately reflect documented
declines in fish size, fecundity, survival rates, ocean production, and rainfall since 1979. The spawning escapement
goal of 200,000 adults is most likely inadequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCN coho stock has been the subject of ongoing review under the Council management process, which requires using
the best scientific information and methodology available. There are several reasons for the consistent and significant
depression in the OCN coho stock, but determination of a primary cause is not currently possible given the inadequacies
in the information available on the stock and its habitat. Additional studies may provide a better definition of the
total OCN coho spawning population. The ODFW is currently in the fourth year of a 5-year study of the methodology used
in estimating OCN coho escapements. The results of that study, coupled with any additional biological data, will
be used to develop a biologically sounder OCN coho escapement goal. Implementation of the Amendment does not hinder
further investigations on the appropriateness of the numerical goal of 200,000 adults. The proposed rule anticipated
revision to the spawning escapement goal, including the 200,000 number, by describing the processes by which the
goal would be revised. If the estimated total number of spawners at the MSY level that is calculated by extrapolating
from the 42 adults per mile in the standard index survey areas is revised, further changes to the FMP or its implementing
regulations would not be necessary. If the number (42) of adult spawners per mile in the standard index survey areas
is revised, the FMP would need to be amended. The framework in 50 CFR part 661, Appendix IV.B. provides for the modification
of escapement goals based on technical evidence.

The Salmon Technical Team has expressed its concern that the unequal distribution of spawners along the Oregon coast
may be an important factor in recent OCN stock status declines. The Council recognizes the problem, but there are insufficient
data at this time to implement separate escapement goals by subdividing the OCN stock aggregate. This matter will
be subject to further analysis.

The escapement goal should be increased by 10 percent to hedge against impacts of harvest on genetic diversity and
ecosystem integrity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 200,000-fish MSY escapement goal has not been met for a number of years, and does not appear to be attainable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1994. Because the goal represents an optimal production level and not a conservation threshold, it provides for
substantial genetic diversity. Although there does not appear to be a statistical basis for any particular level
of additional conservatism, NMFS agrees that, when stock sizes are such that the number of spawners is forecast to
be below 28 per mile when directed fisheries are not allowed, substantial conservatism should be used when allowing
incidental impacts for other fisheries.

Allowable incidental take should be reduced to a maximum of 10 percent to prosecute other fisheries, and should only
be allowed when abundance is between 225,000 and 150,000 fish. No incidental take should be allowed that would result
in escapement below the escapement floor (28 spawners per mile) until scientific information establishes that incidental
take that violates the floor would not result in irreparable harm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The maximum incidental exploitation rate of 20 percent provides flexibility during the annual preseason management
process for structuring fishing seasons to access salmon stocks with allowable harvest levels. Flexibility is also
needed to account for harvest impacts by fisheries outside the Council's purview (e.g., freshwater fisheries and
Canadian fisheries). NMFS will rely on the annual management process to determine the appropriate level of allowable
incidental take. As with any management measure recommended by the Council, NMFS will consider comments by the Council,
its advisers, and the public before implementing an incidental harvest rate. The Regional Director will provide
guidance to the Council on an appropriate rate after consideration of the available information as supported by the
administrative record. The Council demonstrated its ability to exercise harvest restraint on OCN coho, as in 1991,
1992, and 1993, when it recommended emergency regulations to reduce the ocean harvest rate on OCN coho from the levels
set in Amendment 7 to the FMP. For the 1994 season, the Council recommended management measures with an incidental
harvest rate of 11 percent. The standard of the minimum incidental harvest and no irreparable harm replaces other
allocative measures in the plan regarding OCN coho at spawner escapement levels at or below 28 spawners per mile.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A reduction in the body size of salmon could cause a significant reduction in fish productivity and subsequent declines
in stock abundance. The direct relationship between fecundity and fish size has been established in prior research.
Yet the proposed spawning escapement goal has not taken this relationship into account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCN spawning escapement goal is based on data from many series of years. Body size and fecundity undoubtedly varied
depending on ocean feeding conditions, with returning spawners being both above and below the average body size and
fecundity for the time series. The spawning escapement goal is based on average conditions, which take into account
this variability. Since fishery managers cannot predict whether body size will be larger or smaller than normal prior
to the fish appearing in the catch and on the spawning grounds, it is not practical to adjust either the fishing seasons
or the annual spawning escapement goals to account for body size. The spawning escapement goal implemented by the
Amendment assumes average conditions and is set at a level to accommodate annual variations.

Measures for reducing the incidental take of OCN coho are addressed during the annual process for setting management
measures. The Council is currently reviewing its list of research and data needs, which includes improving estimates
of commercial troll shaker mortality. These estimates will be determined by contact rates in various fisheries.
The Council will continue to consider new information as it becomes available, in developing ways to reduce this mortality
through gear selectivity or modification. The Council determined that the Amendment provides the best approach
at the present time, given the currently available information.

The OCN spawning escapement goal implemented by this amendment is based solely on wild fish. Current hatchery practices
are designed to discourage the intermixing of wild and hatchery stocks. Although some intermixing probably occurs,
it is thought to be a small enough proportion of the total spawning population that it does not adversely affect the
production of wild coho salmon.

A supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) on the FMP should be prepared incorporating new scientific
information concerning coho and other salmon since the last SEIS was prepared in 1984.

The environmental assessment (EA) for the Amendment was prepared in accordance with NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6
on Environmental Review Procedures. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), reviewed the EA and concluded
that this action will not significantly affect the human environment. Therefore, preparation of an SEIS is not required.
While new information on salmon stocks has been developed since the last SEIS, prepared for the framework amendment
to the FMP in 1984, there is not sufficient new information specific to the OCN coho stock to warrant preparation of
an SEIS for this action. Under the ESA process, a thorough evaluation of salmon stocks in Washington, Oregon, and California
is being conducted that may result in preparation of at least one SEIS for the FMP.

This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator determined that this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review
(RIR) and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) that are incorporated in the Amendment document and
may be obtained from the Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). A summary of the RIR/IRFA was published on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4897). No public comments were received relating
to small entities and no changes were made in the initial document. Therefore, the document will now serve as a final
regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA determined that this rule must be effective no later than May 1, 1994, when coastwide ocean salmon fishing seasons
are scheduled to open. Therefore, it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay for 30 days the effective
date of this final rule, and the agency finds good cause to waive the delayed effectiveness provision (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3))
of the Administrative Procedure Act.

 (i) *&blank;*&blank;* The recreational allowable ocean harvest will be distributed between the two major recreational
subareas when the recreational allocation is equal to or less than 167,000 fish, in accordance with paragraph 2(b)(v)
of this appendix. At OCN spawning escapements of 28 or fewer adults per mile, the allocation provisions of paragraph
2(b) of this appendix do not apply. Fisheries will be established that will provide only the minimum incidental harvest
of OCN coho necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances will cause irreparable harm to
the OCN stock.

(v) When the recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total recreational allowable ocean harvest of
coho will be divided between two major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation will be 70
percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two
impact quotas may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. Horse Mountain
to Point Arena will be managed for an impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation.
The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest
impact between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected harvest impact that will be taken south
of Point Arena to the end of the season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The recreational fishery
for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs 21 and 22 of Annex 703.2 of Chapter 7 of the NAFTA relate to the trade of sugar and sugar containing products
which receive benefits under re-export programs. Paragraph 21 requires that the United States notify Mexico, in
writing, of any export to Mexico is not obligated to grant NAFTA duty preferences for such products. However, paragraph
22(b) provides that Mexico shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of (i) U.S. raw sugar that will be refined in
Mexico and re-exported to the United States, and (ii) refined sugar that has been refined in the United States from
Mexican raw sugar. Moreover, imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant to paragraph 22(b) will not be
subject to, or counted under, any tariff rate quota. Comments with respect to implementation of these provisions
will be considered in drafting proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are encouraged to consider the rules relating to the maximum license sizes (7 CFR 1530.102(c)
and 1530.202(c)) and provide comments supporting any change. FAS is considering having all programs conform to the
metric system. This change would revise the maximum license sizes from short tons to metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another rule change being considered relates to changes in the notice of transfer submission to the Licensing Authority.
The provisions at 7 CFR 1530.106(c) and 1530.204(c) relating to the original notice of transfer being submitted to
the Licensing Authority within 10 days of the transfer date will be reviewed for possible changes. The agency is considering
having the refiner licensee transmit to FAS the original notice of transfer within X days of the shipment date and then
simply receive and store confirmations from the manufacturer licensees. Information concerning numerous transfers
within an X-day period could be submitted to the Licensing Authority, either by mail or by electronic means.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS is also considering modifying the rule concerning licensee certifications in 7 CFR 1530.105(b). The additional
requirement the agency is considering is having the licensee provide certification to the Licensing Authority within
95 days of the date of export or last certification which ever comes first. An alternative could be to have periodic
reports (e.g., weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on the volume of license activity). This change would allow
the Licensing Authority to establish greater compliance safeguards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensees in the Refined Sugar Re-export program have been informed by FAS that during the time domestic marketing
allotments are in effect, licensees' sugar export shipments could not be certified to the Licensing Authority as
being eligible for license credit except when any domestic sugar can be verified as being counted against marketing
allotment allocations. FAS is interested in developing appropriate rules that would incorporate this limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS also is interested in comments addressing the creation of a program to provide for imports of raw cane sugar exempt
from the tariff-rate quota on condition that an equivalent quantity of raw sugar is exported. Currently, subheading
1701.11.02 and additional U.S. note 3(c) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS)
authorizes the sugar licensing programs but provides only for imports of raw sugar ``to be used for the production
(other than by distillation) of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar
in human food consumption, or to be refined and re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing products.'' This
provision would need to be amended to permit a raw sugar swap program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS is interested in comments relating to the implementation of an automated data system linking licensees with the
Licensing Authority. Automated data processing procedures relating to the use of standardized forms for notices
of transfer and certifications for export credit are of particular interest. Rule change suggestions for providing
a structured data reporting format to enhance program administration and assist in verifying program compliance
are also requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS will give major consideration to the suggestions of manufacturer licensees in the sugar to be re-exported in sugar
containing products program with respect to contractual manufacturing arrangements with co-packers. Comments
should center on the control of quota-exempt sugar to prevent diversion onto the domestic market and the means by which
manufacturer licensees would establish eligibility to receive credit for sugar containing product exports for
products manufactured and exported by a co-packer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS is also considering changing the licenses used under the Sugar for the Production of Polyhydric Alcohol program
from a license to import raw sugar to a license to receive transfers of refined sugar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this will be the best opportunity to modify program regulations, program participants should address any other
issues that they deem appropriate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations concerning program eligibility requirements.
These revisions will direct field offices to suspend processing of an application if an applicant is found to be delinquent
on a Federal debt until the delinquency is resolved, and to deny credit if a Federal judgment is found against an applicant.
This action is necessary to implement requirements of OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs
and Non-Tax Receivables.'' Denying credit to applicants against whom there is a Federal judgment is mandated by provisions
of the Federal Debt Collections Procedures Act of 1990. The intended effect of this action is to instruct field offices
on how to obtain more information to be used in determining loan, grant and loan servicing eligibility.

The current loan application procedures require that an applicant provide certification that it is not delinquent
on a Federal debt. For the purpose of verifying an applicant's certification, FmHA proposes to amend its instructions
by revising each eligibility section to instruct the field offices to access the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
Credit Alert Interactive Voice System (CAIVRS) to verify that the applicant is not delinquent on a Federal debt. If
a delinquency is found, processing of the application will be suspended. The applicant will be notified that processing
has been suspended and will be asked to contact the appropriate Federal agency, at the telephone number provided by
CAIVRS, to resolve the delinquency. When the applicant provides FmHA with official documentation that the delinquency
has been paid in full or otherwise resolved, processing of the application will be continued. If the applicant is unable
to resolve the delinquency, or if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than
the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, is found, assistance may be denied.

(1) The District Office will check the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice
Response System (CAIVRS), following the Forms Manual Insert for Form FmHA 1910&hyph;3, ``Record of Credit Alert
Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS) Inquiry,'' to determine if the applicant is delinquent on a Federal debt.
No decision to deny credit can be based solely on the results of the CAIVRS inquiry. If CAIVRS identifies a delinquent
Federal debt, the District Office will immediately suspend processing of the application. The applicant will be
notified that processing has been suspended and will be asked to contact the appropriate Federal agency, at the telephone
number provided by CAIVRS, to resolve the delinquency. When the applicant provides FmHA with official documentation
that the delinquency has been paid in full or otherwise resolved, processing of the application will be continued.

(2) An outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than the United States Tax Court),

is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. FmHA loan funds may not be used to satisfy the judgment. Questions about whether
or not a judgment is still outstanding should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel. If the judgment remains
unsatisfied, or if the applicant is delinquent on a Federal debt and is unable to resolve the delinquency, the application
will be rejected and the applicant will be notified of its right for an appeal in accordance with subpart B of part 1900
of this chapter. The Administrator may waive the rejection upon specific determination that it is in the best interest
of the Government to do so.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will meet with the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and Yankee Atomic
Electric Company (YAEC) to discuss their written comments that are responsive to the States' concerns regarding
NRC's proposed rule on the environmental review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses.
These concerns focus on provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional
authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation.
The purpose of the meeting is to assure that the NRC staff and the public understands the approaches proposed by NEI

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC published proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish
new requirements for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants
(September 17, 1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, a draft Generic Environmental
Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in Part 51. In commenting on the
proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating
capacity, and alternative energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the
States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect
to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop options for
responding to these States' concerns and in doing so to solicit the views of the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff solicited the views of the States and others through three regional meetings and a request for written
comments (January 18, 1994; 59 FR 2542). To facilitate discussions with the States the NRC staff prepared a paper,
``Addressing the Concerns of States and Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy
Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants:
An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.'' The regional meetings were held in Rockville, MD, February 9, 1994; Rosemont, IL,
February 15, 1994; and Chicopee, MA, February 17, 1994. A number of parties, including NEI and YAEC, filed written
comments subsequent to the meetings. The discussion paper, meeting transcripts, and written comments, including
NEI's proposal dated March 23, 1994, and YAEC's proposal dated March 18, 1994, may be examined at the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEI and the YAEC proposals were not adequately developed for discussion at the time of the regional meetings, and
now the NRC staff needs to be assured that it understands the two proposals before reporting to the Commission on the
options considered. All interested persons are invited to attend as observers. After the NRC staff's questions have
been answered, time will be allowed to take questions and comments from the floor on the NEI and YAEC proposals. The
meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants,
replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This action would
require installation of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which would terminate the inspection requirement.
This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants,
which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1994, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), applicable
to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, to require inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron
quadrants, replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. That
action was prompted by a report that an in-flight failure of a ball bearing in a quadrant in the pilot's aileron control
system caused abnormal backlash of the pilot's aileron control. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent
reduced controllability of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, Jetstream has developed new swivel bearings that allow greater swivel action, which
would significantly decrease the likelihood of abnormal backlash of the aileron control due to bearing failure.
Bearing failure in the aileron quadrants, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures
for installation of swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has also issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, dated January 17, 1994.
The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision 1 of the service
bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10). The only change effected by Revision 2 is to reference
the modification described in Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027 as terminating action for the inspections
of the bearings in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops described in Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the United Kingdom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the
airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA
has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 to require installation
of new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for
the currently required inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this proposal have been revised to reference Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026,
dated January 17, 1994, as an additional source of service information for accomplishing the inspections of the bearings
in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this proposal, take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane, per inspection
cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjustment to the secondary stops that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this
proposal, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this adjustment requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440,
or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have already accomplished this action; therefore,
the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The installation of new swivel bearings (Modification JM41307A) that would be required by this proposal would take
approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts
would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
modification requirement of this proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $550 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

To prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the
airplane, accomplish the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), perform
a detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the bearings in the aileron quadrant in the pilot's and co-pilot's
aileron control, in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026,
Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If no damaged bearing is found, repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If any damaged bearing is found, prior to further flight, replace the damaged bearing with a new bearing in accordance
with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action proposes to establish Class E airspace at Arcata, CA. An Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring
Equipment (ILS/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Arcata Municipal
Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach.
The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations
at Arcata Municipal Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Arcata, CA. This proposal would provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the ILS/DME
approach at Arcata, CA. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace
areas designated as transition areas for airports are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace designated as a surface area for an airport and to modify the 700 foot transition area. An Automated Weather
Observing System has been installed at Lompoc Municipal Airport meeting the criterion for a Class E surface area.
The coordinates for this airspace are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designated as a surface area
for an airport is published in Paragraph 6002 and Class E airspace designations for airspace extending upward from
700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that
this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine
amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to August 3, 1994, the comment period for the advance notice of
proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1994, (59 FR 5363). The document announced the agency's intent to take several related actions to reduce
the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and ingredients whose uses are generally recognized
as safe (GRAS). FDA is taking this action in response to a request to allow additional time for public comment.

 of February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5363), FDA published an ANPRM announcing the agency's intent to take several related actions
to reduce the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients. The ANPRM requested
information on whether the specifications it is considering are feasible, and if they are not, why higher levels will
not endanger the public health, and what levels are feasible. Interested persons were given until May 5, 1994, to provide
comments and information in response to the ANPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has received a request to extend the comment period to permit at least an additional 90 days for public comment.
The request stated that additional time is needed to undertake testing, analysis, and data collection relating to
the ANPRM. The request also asked that the extension be granted as quickly as possible, so that the requester can determine
whether there will be adequate time to perform testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for
interested persons to submit comments and information relating to the ANPRM. Accordingly, FDA is extending the comment
period to August 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before August 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this ANPRM. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 515(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)(1)) establishes the requirement
that a preamendments device that FDA has classified into class III is subject to premarket approval. Section 515(b)(2)(A)
of the act provides that a proceeding for the promulgation of a final rule to require premarket approval shall be initiated
by publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proposed rule to require premarket approval for a preamendments device is made final, section 501(f)(2)(B)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(f)(2)(B)) requires that a PMA or notice of completion of a PDP for any such device be filed within
90 days of the date of promulgation of the final rule or 30 months after final classification of the device under section
513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c), whichever is later. If a PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is not filed by the later of
the two dates, commercial distribution of the device is required to cease. The device may, however, be distributed
for investigational use if the manufacturer, importer, or other sponsor of the device complies with the investigational
device exemption (IDE) regulations. The act does not permit an extension of the 90-day period after promulgation
of a final rule within which an application or a notice is required to be filed.

II. Summary of Risks and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3436), FDA published a proposed rule to require the filing, under section 515(b) of the act
(21 U.S.C. 360e(b)), of PMA's for the classified silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis and all
substantially equivalent devices. In accordance with section 515(b)(2)(A) of the act, FDA included in the preamble
to the proposal the agency's proposed findings regarding: (1) The degree of risk of illness or injury designed to be
eliminated or reduced by requiring the device to meet the premarket approval requirement of the act, and (2) the benefits
to the public from use of the device (58 FR 3436 at 3438). The following is a summary of those findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The envelope or shell of the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis is made of silicone rubber. Accordingly, prolonged
contact with the prosthesis raises the same questions about the potential risks for adverse immunological effects
and/or connective tissue disorders that have been asked with regard to the use of silicone gel-filled breast prostheses
and silicone injections. In addition, no satisfactory, independent data base has been compiled to serve as a basis
for the thorough evaluation of the chronic toxic effects and the possible teratogenic effects of silicone. Lastly,
neither particles which may shed from the silicone shell, nor the chemical forms of silicone monomers or other additives
which may leach from the shell, have yet been adequately characterized with regard to metabolism, distribution,
and excretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most common risk associated with breast augmentation and reconstruction is fibrous capsular contracture, the
formation of a constricting fibrous layer around the prosthesis. Capsular contracture may result in excessive breast
firmness, discomfort, pain, disfigurement, and/or displacement of the implant. Deflation of the implant is another
risk associated with use of the device. Deflation, which results from partial or total loss of the contents due to puncture,
rupture, or other failure of the shell, or a faulty valve, results in the loss of shape of the prosthesis, and often requires
surgical intervention to correct. Lastly, the presence of any breast prosthesis may interfere with standard mammography
procedures used to screen patients for breast cancer. By compressing overlying breast tissue, the presence of the
implant makes it more difficult to detect small tumors. In addition, the presence of the implant can produce a shadow
on the radiograph that may reduce visual clarity of a significant portion of the breast.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether performed for reconstruction or augmentation purposes, breast prosthesis implantation is a discretionary,
elective surgical procedure performed for its psychological benefits. Several studies have been published that
show psychological improvement in both reconstruction and augmentation patients; however, these studies did not
use objective, standardized methodologies that have been validated for measuring the psychological benefit of
the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis is currently the only device legally available for breast
augmentation. For breast reconstruction, the current legal restrictions on the use of silicone gel-filled implants
limit their use to those cases where the silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis is considered medically
unsatisfactory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the available scientific evidence and comments received on the proposed rule, FDA has concluded that PMA's
will need to be submitted and evaluated for the silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis. However,
the agency has also determined that a public hearing is warranted to assist the agency in determining when to issue
a final rule to require the filing of PMA's for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda for the hearing will include: (1) An overview by FDA of the statutory procedure for requesting the submission
of PMA's for preamendment class III devices; (2) a presentation by FDA on the preclinical and clinical studies that
are required to be completed to support a PMA for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis; (3) oral testimony by
the manufacturers on the status of their scientific studies, including their prospective clinical studies, and
the scheduled timeframe for completion of those studies; and (4) oral testimony by consumers and/or representatives
of consumer and health professional organizations to assist the agency in determining when to require the filing
of PMA's for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis. To the extent possible, oral testimony should address the
following issues:

1. To what extent do protocols for your pre-clinical testing and ongoing clinical prospective studies reflect the
elements identified in the guidance for submission of PMA's for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis? For major
items that do not comply with the FDA guidance document, what is the basis for the scientific validity of the involved
tests and/or studies?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. When were such studies commenced, and when do you expect to have completed all the studies that are necessary for
submission of a PMA?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How many patients are being implanted with silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prostheses at the current
time (e.g., 1993 through the present)?

1. Based on the risks to health as you understand them today, what degree of priority do you recommend that FDA give to
calling for safety and effectiveness data for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Based on the benefits of the device as you understand them today, to what extent do you believe that continued availability
of the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis fulfills an important patient need that would otherwise be unmet if
the device was no longer commercially available or restricted in its availability?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do you believe that FDA should distinguish between use of the device for breast reconstruction versus use for augmentation
purposes in its regulation of the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service proposes changes in several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning bulk and presort
mailing fees and the methods of paying postage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the terms of application of bulk and presort mailing
fees on First-, third-, and fourth-class mail, by requiring payment of the fee only by the party entering the mail,
regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used as the device for postage payment
on the mailing. A single fee payment would allow mailing at all bulk or presort rate categories of the corresponding
class of mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and
Circulation, generally to allow publication anytime during October of the filing year rather than in a specific issue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P040 is amended both to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently
the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information
about such mailings. Generally, mailers will be allowed to use a company style imprint without having to obtain permits
at two or more post offices, but mailers will be required to show a return address at which records of the mailing will
be made available upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Generally, the new standards allow
for more creativity while retaining restrictions that ensure that the indicia content is readable and clearly identifiable
as postage payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miscellaneous other changes are made for consistency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice presents revisions to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards suggested during the DMM revision project
begun in 1992. DMM Issue 46 (July 1993) was the first result of that project, but was not intended to make changes simultaneously
in substantive mailing requirements; such amendments were deferred for subsequent action such as this rulemaking.
This notice focuses on several matters related to the use of permit imprints (for First-, third-, and fourth-class
mail) and to the method of paying postage for second-class mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the assessment of bulk or presort mailing fees on First-,
third-, and fourth-class mail. Existing standards brought forward from DMM Issue 45 and earlier are inconsistent
with one another. A single standard applies to all First-Class (and Priority) Mail_that a fee must be paid once each
12-month period by any person or organization entering mail at other than the single-piece rates. Payment of that
fee allows use of any presort or bulk First-Class rate and the mailing of both the payer's mail and that of its clients.
By contrast, third-class standards distinguish between postage-affixed (precanceled and meter stamp) and permit
imprint mailers. Fourth-class presents its standards yet another way. Understandably this variation confuses
both customers and postal employees and may cause fees to be assessed incorrectly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision below amends the standards cited earlier to state them uniformly for all three classes: The mailing fee
applicable to the particular class of mail must be paid once each 12-month period at each office of mailing (except
as provided otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) by any person or organization entering mailings of that
class at other than a single-piece or nonpresorted rate, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit,
or meter was used to pay postage on the mail; payment of the one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own
mail (and that of its clients) at all the bulk or presort rates available in the corresponding class of mail. By this
revision, the Postal Service believes that confusion over this type of fee payment should be effectively eliminated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management,
and Circulation. The current standard requires each publisher of a second-class publication to file Form 3526 by
October 1 of each year for each authorized publication. The information on that form (or a facsimile of the form) must
be published in the first issue after October 1 of the corresponding general or requester second-class publication.
Publishers have asked that this specification be relaxed to offer more latitude on the issue in which the information
may appear. Because 39 U.S.C. 3685 allows the Postal Service the authority to administer such details as when the form
is filed or published, the Postal Service believes it can change those criteria without adversely affecting the informational
value of what is published. The Postal Service sees no benefit from retaining a stringent requirement when a reasonable
relaxation is sought and supported by the industry. Therefore, the cited standard is amended as shown below to clarify
its applicability and require publication of Form 3526 in any issue published during October. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. P040 is amended to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently
the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information
about such mailings. Current standards require a permit imprint indicium to contain the mailer's permit number and
the name of the post office where the permit is held unless, for a mailer having permit imprint authorizations at two
or more post offices, a ``company'' style indicium is used. In a company style indicium, the name of the permit holder
is substituted for the permit number and post office name. This style is preferred and used extensively by customers
who produce large mailings for entry at multiple sites, who may change printers or mailers regularly, who purchase
large quantities of envelope stock, or who simply prefer the appearance of the company style over the basic format.
Customers who have no need for multiple permit imprint authorizations have noted that it is a pointless burden on the
Postal Service and its customers to generate and maintain a second permit imprint account simply to gain access to
the company style indicium. These customers have requested relaxation of the applicable standards to let any permit
holder use the company style format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current standards also require that company permit imprint mailpieces bear a complete domestic return address,
but do not specify what that address is to represent. Consequently, the Postal Service has found it difficult to trace
such mailpieces back to the point of mailing in situations where classification or postage matters have been questioned.
Moreover, no remedies exist for instances in which the permit holder deliberately frustrates the Postal Service's
efforts to identify the point of mailing, what was mailed, and whether the correct postage was paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, P040 is amended as shown below to allow use of a company style permit imprint indicium by any permit mailer
regardless of the number of permits held. The Postal Service is also requiring more information to document company
permit imprint mailings (and mailings including company permit imprint pieces), is specifying the required return
address, and is enhancing its administrative remedies when the permit holder fails to supply mailing or permit use
information on the request of the Postal Service. No additional record-keeping responsibilities are being added
for either the mailer or the local post office. Rather, it is proposed that mailers use the location (the permit holder's
or its agent's) at which records for the mailing will be available to the Postal Service on request as the required return
address. The revised standards allow suspension or revocation of permits if such records are not provided in a timely
manner. The Postal Service believes the higher standards are a prudent administrative control and do not represent
an unreasonable condition: each permit holder should be able to detail what was mailed, where, and how much postage
was paid, and should have no legitimate reason to withhold such details from the Postal Service. Postal Service actions
against fraudulent uses of permits should be enhanced by these proposed measures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Current standards allow use of
only the formats illustrated in the DMM_basically a plain box with plain lettering. While this format was adequate
for years, contemporary marketing techniques and competitive pressures among mail users have made the attractiveness
of the mailpiece a cornerstone of efforts to interest the addressee in what is inside the mailpiece. As a result, mailers
have become more interested in using artistic latitude in designing the permit imprint indicium that appears on the
mailpiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service understands the mailer interest in this matter and accepts the validity of proposals for greater
design flexibility. However, those must be balanced against the needs of the Postal Service to maintain the clear
recognition of the indicium both as evidence of postage payment and as an indicator of the mailer's identity. Therefore,
P040 is amended as shown below to allow some greater flexibility in the preparation of permit imprint indicia. Generally,
the proposed standard reinforces the distinctiveness of an indicium but allows its incorporation into a design of
the mailer's choice. The combined design must be in a prescribed area of the upper right corner of the address side,
area, or label on the mailpiece, must not imitate a stamp or meter impression, and must keep the indicia free of words
and other printing not specified by the format standards. While some mailers may prefer more latitude, the Postal
Service believes the proposed standards grant significant new flexibility to mailpiece designers in a reasonable
balance between such flexibility and the Postal Service's legitimate interest in maintaining recognizable permit
indicia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. Key rates basically represent a simplified method of
computing zone-rate postage on issues of second-class publications having a stable distribution pattern. Publishers
and others who provided the Postal Service with suggestions for simplifying these regulations noted the diminishing
use of key rates in an era of centralized postage, electronic funds transfer, multiple editions, and other industry
changes. At the same time, postal personnel, noting how seldom key rates are used and the resulting lessening of understanding
and experience in their administration, agreed that their continued availability should be questioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, by the revision shown below, the Postal Service proposes to end the use of key rates. No new users would be
added after September 30, 1994, or on adoption of a final rule, whichever is later, and, to allow for an orderly transition
for remaining key rate users, termination of key rates would be deferred until March 31, 1995, or 6 months after adoption
of a final rule, whichever is later. The Postal Service recognizes that there are some publishers that may still use
key rates and does not wish to impact them more than necessary. However, the Postal Service, which also recognizes
the need to eliminate nonessential regulations if the mailing community is to be better served, feels that key rates
exemplify a potential for such action.

indicium if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For 2 years after the last date of mailing, the permit holder keeps records for each mailing paid by company permit
imprint for USPS review on request. These records include (for each version of what was mailed, if applicable) a complete
sample mailpiece; the weight of a single piece; the total number of pieces mailed; the total postage; the date(s) and
post office(s) of mailing, and other records required by the rate of postage claimed or the method of payment used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Each mailpiece bears the complete domestic return address of the mailer or the mailer's agent, that address being
the physical location at which the records listed in 3.5a are available for USPS review. On unendorsed bulk third-class
mail, the return address may be below the permit imprint.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 21, 1994 (59 FR 13294), EPA proposed a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act to require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing
of refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) in any new product form not listed, or any new application of an existing product
form not listed in the proposed rule. Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before April 20,
1994. EPA received a request from a trade association seeking a 30&hyph;day extension of the public comment period
because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information on uses not listed in the proposal. EPA believes
that providing an additional 30&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. EPA is therefore reopening
the comment period 30 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written comments
must be received on or before June 3, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit
the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers.
Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before May 9, 1994. EPA received requests seeking a 60&hyph;day
extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information it requested
in the proposed rule. EPA believes that providing an additional 60&hyph;day comment period to prepare written comments
is reasonable. EPA is therefore extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity
to comment fully. Written comments must be received by EPA on or before July 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed
rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential
version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim
information confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some
other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only
to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket
without further notice to that person.

The Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking initiating a comprehensive review of the performance of local
exchange carriers under price cap regulation. The Commission pledged to undertake this fourth-year review when
it adopted price cap regulation for the Regional Bell Operating Companies, GTE, and electing local exchange carriers.
A motion for extension of time was filed on March 30, 1994, by the United States Telephone Association and granted by
the Commission on April 7, 1994. This notice serves to grant all local exchange carriers additional time in which to
file comments and replies on the issues set forth in the above-cited NPRM.

2. USTA states that the Commission has requested that interested parties submit detailed information and quantitative
data on a wide variety of issues, ranging from the broad policy goals underlying the price cap plan, to specific details
of the plan, to transition issues related to increasing competition in access markets. USTA indicates that it is the
principal trade association representing the entire local exchange carrier industry and views this proceeding
as critically important to determining the future of the telecommunications industry. USTA asserts that the quantification
and other analyses that it will be submitting cannot be completed in time for inclusion in comments to be filed on April
18. Therefore, it argues, an extension of time is necessary for USTA to gather and analyze relevant data and to allow
its consultants to prepare their reports and obtain the approval of USTA's membership before those reports can be
incorporated in its comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Common Carrier Bureau has reviewed USTA's request for extension of time and has determined that good cause has
been shown to grant all interested parties additional time, until May 9, 1994, to file comments and until June 8, 1994
to file reply comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Therefore, it is ordered that the United States Telephone Association's motion for extension of time is granted
to the extent specified herein.

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice to the public that it will be developing regulations that
will clarify, update, and add to existing regulations for the administration of special use permits (permits) on
national wildlife refuges (refuges) in Alaska. These changes will include but not be limited to: Permit application,
denial, and appeal procedures; permit fees; and the process for issuing permits where a competitive selection process
is used to select the permit holder (e.g., big game guide-outfitters).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) (43 U.S.C. 1602&hyph;1784), the National Wildlife
Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd&hyph;668ee), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16
U.S.C. 460k&hyph;460k&hyph;4) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe regulations as necessary to
administer permits for compatible activities on refuges in Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations governing issuance of permits on refuge units in Alaska, codified at 50 CFR 36.41, were originally
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 46 FR 40192 on August 7, 1981, and later amended at 51 FR 44794 on December 12, 1986. Since that time, the permit administration
program on refuges in Alaska has continued to evolve. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to provide up-to-date
guidance to both commercial users and Service employees for the administration of permits in Alaska. Prior to promulgating
these revised regulations, the Service will be reviewing its existing permit administration program and will be
proposing revisions based on over 12 years of experience with the program and the implementation of ANILCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evolution of the program for administering permits has been influenced by a number of factors since the original
regulations were promulgated. One factor has been the increased public awareness and understanding of the need for
securing permits prior to engaging in many activities on refuges in Alaska.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor is the November 1984 Inspector General's Audit Report that found that the Service was not collecting
fees which were commensurate with the value of the commercial activities authorized. This audit resulted in the Service
developing a fee schedule based on client use days instead of charging a fixed $100 administrative fee for all permits
regardless of the scope of income generated by the commercial permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another event causing a significant impact on refuge permit administration in Alaska was the decision of the Alaska
Supreme Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Owsichek 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State Guide Licensing and Control Board, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
763 P.2d 488 (Alaska, 1988). That ruling found the State's system of assigning exclusive guide areas unconstitutional.
Prior to this ruling, the Service had depended upon the State's system for selecting and assigning guides to areas
which were located within refuge lands. In an attempt to allow the State an opportunity to develop a constitutionally
acceptable system, and one which would satisfy Service needs, the Service imposed a moratorium on the issuance of
permits to new guide applicants. This effectively limited the availability of permits to those who were guiding at
the time of the 1988 court ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After some time, the Service decided to develop its own interim program in order to provide an equal opportunity for
all registered big game guide-outfitters to compete for permits. During late 1991 and early 1992, the Service proposed
an interim system to select big game guide-outfitters. After soliciting public comment on the system, and making
revisions based on substantive comments, an interim program was implemented in June 1992. Requests for proposals
were then solicited and applicants were notified of selections in January 1993. Successful applicants were awarded
5-year permits effective July 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It now appears that the State may not be able to implement a satisfactory system for the selection of guide-outfitters
prior to the expiration of the 5-year permits the Service issued in 1993. Accordingly, the Service proposes to initiate
development of regulations related to the big game guide-outfitter program and include them in the revised regulations
pertaining to the general administration of permits in Alaska (50 CFR 36.41). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has identified several issues at this preliminary stage for which it invites public comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is the existing 180 day period allowed for filing appeals of adverse decisions on permits appropriate in this instance?
Should a separate appeal system be developed which speaks directly to big game guide-outfitters? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To what extent should the existing interim system for selecting big game guide-outfitters be made part of the regulations?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the State develops a selection system that meets Service requirements, should provision be made for the suspension
of the Service permit selection system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the foregoing issues, as well as other related aspects of this process, are encouraged. The Service will
follow this comment period with the publication of a proposed rule which will allow, also, for additional comments
prior to publication of a final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS proposes regulations to implement several management measures designed to prevent some Gulf of Alaska (GOA)
trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the GOA halibut bycatch limit; amend the directed fishing
standards to prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed
fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed
to directed fishing; change the opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries in the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) from May 1 to January 1; and implement changes pertaining to the annual
specification and management of GOA halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. This action is necessary to reduce
the likelihood that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch
limit established for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish
under halibut bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives
of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
of Commerce in accordance with the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish
Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the
U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a rulemaking that would implement several management
measures that are intended to prevent some GOA trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the halibut
bycatch limit relative to other groundfish trawl fisheries. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch
cap before some groundfish total allowable catches (TACs) have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations
in the GOA even though the full groundfish harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries. These measures were
presented to the Council in September 1993 by GOA and BSAI trawl industry representatives as an alternative to FMP
amendments under consideration by the Council that would establish a super-exclusive registration program for
vessels participating in the GOA and BSAI groundfish fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three measures were proposed to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already
established for the trawl gear fisheries (&sect;672.20(f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water
fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'');
and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and rockfish);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards
(&sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder,
or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other,
more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a
result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species
at &sect;675.20(h)(2) are also revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its December 1993 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS implement these measures early in the 1994 fishing year
by emergency interim rulemaking. An emergency rule was issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222) under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed description of, and justification for, each of the proposed management measures, including editorial
changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch limits, follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishment of Two GOA Trawl Categories for Purposes of Apportioning the Halibut Bycatch Mortality Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing regulations at &sect;672.20(f) establish a framework process for the annual specification of separate
Pacific halibut PSC limits for ``trawl'' and ``fixed gear'' fisheries, and for apportioning those limits by season.
Although these regulations limit the bycatch of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have
resulted in conflict among, and preemption of, groundfish trawling operations in the GOA as various trawl fishery
components compete for shares of the available halibut PSC limit. This conflict occurs due to seasonal variations
in halibut bycatch rates and amounts of halibut caught in the various trawl fisheries; NMFS lacks regulatory authority
to apportion the halibut PSC limit among separate trawl fishery categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under existing regulations, the possibility exists for the activities of one group of trawl vessels fishing for a
particular groundfish species or species complex to take a disproportionate amount of the halibut PSC limit relative
to other groundfish fisheries. The halibut PSC limit may be reached before the attainment of the fisheries' TAC amount
and cause closure of all trawling operations in the GOA, except for trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear. Such
closures may cause: significant amounts of economically important TAC to remain unharvested; idling of vessels
and crew; and, a disruption of processing, fishing support sectors, fishery-dependent communities, and intermediate
and final markets. Even if the total trawl PSC limit is not reached prematurely, the threat that it may be reached at
any point in the fishing year can force other user groups to incur unnecessary costs, alter fishing plans, or operate
in a manner that causes conflict among user groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the potentially adverse impacts of the present process used to manage halibut bycatch in the GOA trawl fisheries
could be avoided or reduced if the GOA trawl PSC limit were apportioned between competing fishery categories. Fishery
data from the GOA trawl fisheries indicate that the variation in halibut bycatch rates and associated bycatch mortality
in these fisheries appears to be relatively well demarcated by the following operational categories: (1) Those vessels
fishing for species in the ``shallow-water species complex'' (pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead
sole, Atka mackerel, or ``other species''); and (2) those vessels fishing for species in the ``deep-water species
complex'' (sablefish, rockfish, deep water flatfish, and arrowtooth flounder). The Council's recommended management
measure included flathead sole in the deep-water complex; however, 1993 fishery data show that more than 65 percent
of the total GOA flathead sole harvest was associated with fisheries in the shallow-water complex. Therefore, NMFS
proposes to include flathead sole in the shallow-water complex. In general, the shallow-water and deep-water complexes
are associated with inshore and offshore trawl operations, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on Council recommendations at its September and December 1993 meetings, NMFS proposes to apportion the 1994
GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries and seasons as set out below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apportionment of the 2,000 metric ton (mt) halibut bycatch mortality limit established for the 1994 GOA trawl fisheries
among the shallow and deep-water trawl fishery complexes and seasons. Seasons open and close at 12 noon, Alaska local
time (A.l.t.), except that the first season opens at 0001 hours, A.l.t., January 20, and the last season ends at 12 midnight,
A.l.t., December 31.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attainment of a seasonal (quarterly) bycatch allowance by a fishery complex would result in directed fishing closures
for each species within that fishery complex for the remainder of the quarter, except that when the halibut bycatch
allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for the shallow-water complex is reached, directed fishing
for pollock with pelagic trawl gear may continue subject to other regulatory provisions under &sect;672.20(f).
Any overages or shortfalls of a quarterly bycatch allowance would be accounted for in the subsequent quarterly allowance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed justification for the fishery and seasonal apportionments of the 1994 halibut PSC limit is described in
the EA prepared for this management measure (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These apportionments are intended to accommodate seasonal bycatch requirements in a manner that optimizes the
1994 halibut PSC limit established for trawl gear relative to anticipated trawl fishing patterns and 1994 groundfish
TACs.

Revision of the Methodology Used To Calculate Retainable Amounts of Groundfish Under Directed Fishing Standards

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule amends &sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i) to address problems with the current regulatory provisions
for calculation of ``retainable'' bycatch amounts of groundfish species for which directed fishing is closed. Current
regulations provide for an overly liberal computation of retainable amounts of groundfish bycatch species, because
the basis for bycatch retention inappropriately includes species not open for directed fishing. This compromises
the purpose of using directed fishing standards to restrict bycatch of species after directed fishery closures.
This also creates a circular process, effectively allowing excessive bycatch retention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An associated concern exists that operators of some vessels deliberately target on arrowtooth flounder merely to
provide a basis for retaining allowable amounts of highly valued groundfish species for which directed fishing is
closed. In this case, arrowtooth flounder is harvested solely for the purpose of providing ``directed catch'' against
which ``retainable bycatch'' quantities may be calculated and accumulated. The arrowtooth flounder directed catch
is discarded and only the economically valuable bycatch, authorized on the basis of the quantity of the arrowtooth
harvest, is actually retained for processing. This practice effectively subverts the ``bycatch only'' intent of
fishery closures and associated directed fishing standards at &sect;672.20(g) and &sect;675.20(h). Furthermore,
trawl operations for arrowtooth flounder experience relatively high bycatch rates of halibut and, thus, contribute
to premature attainment of the halibut PSC limit, further aggravating the competition for the halibut PSC limit in
the GOA trawl fisheries and increasing the potential for costly trawl fishery closures.

Adjustment of Season Opening Dates for the BSAI Flatfish Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would adjust the opening date for the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1
to January 1. The purpose of this season adjustment is to provide the BSAI trawl industry with viable fishing alternatives;
reduce the need for, and likelihood of, significant movement of fishing capacity from the BSAI to the GOA; reduce competition
for the halibut PSC limit established for the GOA trawl fisheries; and reduce the likelihood that displacement of
Bering Sea trawl effort into the GOA may preempt fishing opportunities for GOA operations later in the fishing year
by exhausting the GOA trawl halibut PSC limit, thus necessitating GOA-wide trawl closures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original purpose for delaying directed fishing for yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' species until May 1
was to prevent the joint venture processing (JVP) and domestic annual processing (DAP) fisheries from taking a disproportionate
share of their respective red king crab or halibut bycatch allowances established for Bycatch Limitation Zones 1
or 2H (defined at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;675.2), before available amounts of yellowfin sole and other groundfish species were harvested. Early attainment
of red king crab or halibut bycatch allowances due to of high bycatch rates experienced in the early spring flatfish
fisheries resulted in premature fishery closures that prevented available amounts of flatfish and other groundfish
species from being harvested. Delaying the opening of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries until
May 1 allowed the DAP fisheries to utilize the bulk of the available Zone 1 PSC limits in the rock sole and Pacific cod
fisheries from January through April, optimizing their catch of allocated groundfish species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flatfish fisheries have changed substantially since the May 1 starting date was implemented. JVP fisheries no
longer operate in the EEZ off Alaska. The domestic industry has developed profitable new markets for products from
the ``other flatfish'' complex. In addition, the yellowfin sole and rock sole/''other flatfish'' fisheries are
allocated separate bycatch allowances that may be seasonally apportioned to optimize the groundfish harvest within
the established prohibited species bycatch restrictions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The May 1 opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries now has the effect of preventing domestic
fishermen from harvesting these resources at the beginning of the fishing year, when few other fishing opportunities
exist. This season has contributed, for example, to a situation in which the available TAC for the ``other flatfish''
complex has been underutilized in recent years. In 1991, only about 47 percent of the TAC for this species group was
harvested. In 1992 and 1993, that figure was 38 percent and 45 percent, respectively. Nonetheless, while these resources
have been underutilized, despite an expressed interest in accessing them at the beginning of the fishing year, retention
of the May 1 opening has forced BSAI trawl fishermen either to move into the GOA deep-water flatfish fishery, which
opens in January, or cease fishing until May 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rock sole fishery in the Bering Sea currently opens at the beginning of the fishing year to allow fishing in the lucrative
``roe'' fishery. This fishery typically closes in late February or early March when the rock sole have finished spawning.
Seasonal halibut bycatch restrictions can close other fisheries (e.g., Pacific cod during 1991 and 1992), leaving,
as noted above, few alternative fishing opportunities for the BSAI groundfish fleet. Flathead sole, one of the species
in the Bering Sea ``other flatfish'' category, produce roe that matures just after rock sole roe matures. Markets
for roe-bearing flathead sole have emerged, making this fishery a natural extension of that for roe-bearing rock
sole in the Bering Sea. Other markets for these flatfish species, including a domestic fillets market, are under development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opening the BSAI yellowfin sole fishery and the ``other flatfish'' fishery at the beginning of the fishing year (January
1) would provide vessels operating in the Bering Sea with the opportunity to participate in a potentially profitable,
developing fishery. This opportunity is expected to reduce the need for vessels to move into the GOA trawl fisheries
early in the fishing year, and thus would decrease pressure on the GOA halibut PSC limit and diminish the probability
of preemption of existing GOA groundfish fisheries through early closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend the directed fishing standard for flatfish species (&sect;675.20(h)(2)) to accommodate
this season change and allow sufficient bycatch amounts of rock sole, yellowfin sole, arrowtooth flounder, or ``other
flatfish'' in the flatfish fisheries, while allowing for fishing operations to minimize the discard waste of these
species. The proposed rule would also establish species-specific standards, rather than aggregate standards,
for all flatfish species closed to directed fishing. The intent of this action is to simplify directed fishing standards,
and to reduce discard waste by increasing the retainable amounts of flatfish species closed to directed fishing relative
to other flatfish species that are open to directed fishing.

NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. All vessels using trawl gear
to harvest BSAI or GOA groundfish and processors receiving trawl-caught groundfish could be affected by the management
measures proposed under this action. Most catcher vessels harvesting groundfish off Alaska meet the definition
of a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In 1993, 265 catcher vessels were issued permits to harvest
groundfish with trawl gear in Federal waters. All these vessels could be affected due to adjustments in fishing patterns
resulting from (1) changing the season of the BSAI flatfish fisheries, and (2) revising the management of the GOA halibut
PSC limit established for trawl fisheries. These effects are not expected to result in a reduction in annual gross
revenues by more than 5 percent, annual compliance costs that would increase total costs of production by more than
5 percent, or compliance costs for small entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent
of sales for large entities. Therefore, the proposed action would not result in a ``significant economic impact''
on small entities under the RFA. A copy of the EA/RIR is available (see

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice solicits comment on proposed revisions of the regulations for assessing natural resource damages resulting
from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act or a release of a hazardous substance under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The Department of the Interior has previously
developed two types of natural resource damage assessment regulations: Standard procedures for simplified assessments
requiring minimal field observation (the type A rule); and site-specific procedures for detailed assessments in
individual cases (the type B rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing, as part of its compliance with a court remand, to revise the type B rule to address the use
of the economic methodology known as contingent valuation to assess lost values of injured natural resources. In
general, the Department is considering and soliciting comment on a proposed natural resource damage assessment
rule regarding contingent valuation recently published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
pursuant to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. This notice constitutes the Department's proposed rulemaking document
and solicits comment on rule language under consideration for a final rule. Upon consideration of the comments received
in response to this notice, the Department intends to issue a final rule. The Department recently published a final
rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all other aspects of the court order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (CERCLA) authorize natural resource trustees to recover compensatory damages for injury to, destruction of, or
loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters or a release of a hazardous substance.
CWA sec. 311(f); CERCLA sec. 107. Federal and State officials may be designated to serve as natural resource trustees
under CERCLA and CWA. CERCLA also recognizes the authority of Indian tribes to commence actions as natural resource
trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries and losses that are not fully remedied by response actions.
All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. Trustee officials may also recover the reasonable costs
of assessing natural resource damages and any prejudgment interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CERCLA requires the promulgation of two types of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting
either from a discharge of oil under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 301(c).
The type A regulations constitute standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation.
The type B regulations constitute site-specific procedures for detailed assessments. Both regulations identify
the best available procedures for determining natural resource damages. Assessments performed by Federal and State
natural resource trustee officials in accordance with these regulations receive a rebuttable presumption in court.
CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department of the Interior
(the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA) was signed into law on August 18, 1990. Among other things, OPA amended
the natural resource damage provisions of CWA. OPA authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) to develop new natural resource damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters.
The Department is coordinating its rulemakings with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent
processes are established for assessing natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. OPA provides that until NOAA
develops final regulations, the Department's regulations may be used to assess natural resource damages under OPA.
OPA sec. 6001(b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has issued various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug. 1,
1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are
all codified at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule that has not yet been codified in
the Code of Federal Regulations. 59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as technical methods for the actual identification of injuries and calculation of damages. Under the regulations,
both type A and type B, assessments consist of four major phases.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first phase of an assessment conducted under the regulations involves the activities that precede the actual
assessment. For example, upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials
perform a preassessment screen to ascertain whether further assessment actions are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second phase involves the preparation of an Assessment Plan. The Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review
and comment, assists the involvement of other interested trustee officials, potentially responsible parties (PRPs),
and the general public. The Assessment Plan also ensures that assessments are performed at a reasonable cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the third phase, trustee officials conduct the work described in the Assessment Plan. The work involves three steps:
Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials
determine whether any natural resources have been injured. If trustee officials determine that resources have been
injured, they proceed to Quantification, in which they quantify the resulting reduction in services provided by
the resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought
as damages for the natural resource injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a type A assessment, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination
through the use of standardized procedures involving minimal field work. The Department has adopted a phased approach
to developing type A procedures for different environments. Only one type A procedure has been developed to date.
The existing type A procedure provides for the use of a computer model to assess damages from small releases or discharges
in coastal or marine environments. For other releases or discharges, trustee officials conduct a type B assessment,
in which Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination are performed through the use of a range
of alternative scientific and economic valuation methodologies. This notice addresses the use of a particular valuation
methodology during the Assessment Phase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth phase of every natural resource damage assessment, whether the type A or type B rule is followed, consists
of post-assessment activities such as: Preparation of a Report of Assessment; establishment of an account for damage
assessment awards; and development of a Restoration Plan for use of the awards.

C. Judicial Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A party may petition the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any regulation issued under
CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 113(a). A number of parties filed such petitions for review of the natural resource damage assessment
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type B rule was challenged in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 upheld various challenged aspects of the type B rule but did remand three issues. The court ordered the Department
to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource
damages. The court used the term ``restoration costs'' to encompass the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources. 880 F.2d at 441. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court also ordered the Department to allow for the assessment of all reliably calculated lost values of injured
natural resources, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities
such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent on use of the resource. Nonuse values include existence
value, which is the value of knowing that a resource exists, and bequest value, which is the value of knowing that a resource
will be available for future generations. Finally, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural
resource damage assessment regulations apply to natural resources that are not actually owned by the government.

19752. On July 2, 1991, the Department extended the comment period to July 16, 1991. 56 FR 30367. On July 22, 1993, the
Department reopened the comment period to allow consideration of additional comments, including newly developed
information on the contingent valuation methodology (CV), the only method currently available for the express purpose
of estimating nonuse values. 58 FR 39328. The comment period was originally reopened until September 7, 1993, and
then extended until September 22, 1993. 58 FR 45877 (Aug. 31, 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, the Department proposes to revise the type B rule to include appropriate standards to improve the reliability
of CV when used to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department is issuing this notice to ensure that interested parties
have an adequate opportunity for review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all aspects of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 remand other than the assessment of lost nonuse values. 59 FR 14281. Pending completion of this rulemaking, the Department
is temporarily leaving unchanged the language of the original type B rule concerning the assessment of lost nonuse
values.

E. Other Rulemakings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CERCLA mandates biennial review and revision, as appropriate, of the natural resource damage assessment regulations.
The Department plans to begin the biennial update of the type B rule in July 1994. All aspects of the administrative
process and the type B rule will be subject to review during that update. During the biennial review, the Department
will consider ways of ensuring the greatest consistency appropriate between its damage assessment regulations
and the damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, later this year the Department plans to issue a proposed rule to revise the type A rule for coastal and marine
environments in compliance with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Colorado 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department is also developing an additional type A rule for assessing damages in the Great Lakes. Like the type
A rule for coastal and marine environments, the type A rule for the Great Lakes will incorporate a computer model.

A. Costs of Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The type B rule as originally published on August 1, 1986, provided that damages consisted of the lesser of the cost
of restoring the injured resources (plus the lost interim use value) or the diminution in the value of the injured resources
without restoration. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interior
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs
as the measure of natural resource damages. CERCLA provides that sums recovered in natural resource damage actions
may be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court
used the simple term ``restoration'' costs as shorthand for the cost of performing any of these actions. 880 F.2d at
441. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that revised the type B rule to allow trustee officials
to recover the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources
in all cases. 59 FR 14281. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 25, 1994, final rule provides guidance on projecting the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Under that final rule, trustee officials first identify
and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials also estimate those services that are likely to be lost
to the public pending completion of each alternative under consideration. Trustee officials then select one of the
possible alternatives based on several factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan, which is subject to public review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the trustee officials select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative,
they choose the methods they intend to use to estimate the costs of implementing that alternative. To do this, trustee
officials select among specified cost estimating methodologies. Trustee officials include the rationale for their
selection in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Compensable Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the March 25, 1994, final rule, the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent
of the injured resources are the basic measure of damages; however, these costs are only one component of the damages
that trustee officials may assess. Trustee officials also have the discretion to assess the value of the resource
services that the public lost from the date of the release or discharge until completion of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 59 FR 14283. The term ``compensable value'' is used to
encompass all of the lost public economic values, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. The Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan includes a description of the methodologies trustee officials intend to use
when estimating compensable value during Damage Determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original type B rule provided a ranked list of methodologies that could be used to calculate lost use values. If
the market for the injured resource was ``reasonably competitive,'' then the diminution of the market price attributable
to the discharge or release was used to estimate damages. If a market price methodology was not applicable, then the
trustee officials were required to use appraisal methodologies. Only when neither market-price nor appraisal methodologies
were appropriate for the resources being assessed did the original version of the rule allow trustee officials to
use non-market-based methodologies.

Further, &sect;&sect;11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original version of the type B rule provided that lost
nonuse values could only be assessed if trustee officials could not determine any lost use values. In the August 1,

Ordinarily, option and existence values would be added to use values. However, section 301(c) of CERCLA mentions
only use values. Therefore, the primary emphasis in this section is on the estimation of use values&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
Another related reason for this limitation is that more is known about the determination of use values than option
and existence values. Option and existence values are less well-defined and more uncertainty surrounds their measurement.

III. Contingent Valuation: Discussion and Rule Language Under Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CV is a survey-based approach to the valuation of nonmarket goods and services that relies on a questionnaire for the
direct elicitation of information about the value of the good or service in question. The value obtained for the good
or service is said to be contingent upon the nature of the constructed (hypothetical or simulated) market and the good
or service described in the survey scenario. In the natural resource damage assessment context, CV studies generally
derive values through elicitation of respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) to prevent injuries to natural resources
or to restore injured natural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first published CV study, valuing outdoor recreation, appeared in 1963. There are now over 1,400 documented papers,
reports, and books on CV. In recent years, CV has become one of the most widely used methods of nonmarket valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four basic elements common to CV questionnaires are: (1) An explanation of the structure and rules of the market in
which the good or service being valued is either bought or sold; (2) a description of the good or service and how it is
to be provided; (3) the value elicitation question; and (4) validation questions to verify comprehension and acceptance
of the scenario and to elicit socioeconomic and attitudinal characteristics to interpret the variation in responses
to the valuation question across respondents. There are no universal rules on how each of these elements of a CV questionnaire
should be designed, since the appropriate formulation of each depends on the good or service being valued and its context
and, consequently, will vary across applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CV surveys generally measure total value of a good or service, which includes both use values and nonuse values. However,
nonuse values, unlike use values, are not linked to observable behavior and, thus, are more difficult to validate
externally than use values. Therefore, criticisms of CV pertain primarily to its use in valuing the nonuse component
of total value and the difficulty of external validation of that component of total value. Among the most commonly
cited criticisms of CV studies of nonuse values are: The stated intentions of WTP in CV surveys may exceed ``true''
WTP; CV may produce results that appear inconsistent with the tenets of rational choice; respondents to CV surveys
on nonuse may be unfamiliar with the good or service being valued and therefore may not have an adequate basis for articulating
their true value; CV respondents may be expressing a value for the satisfaction (warm glow) of giving rather than the
value of the good or service in question; and respondents may fail to take CV questions seriously because the financial
implications of their responses are not binding. Most proponents of CV acknowledge that poorly designed and administered
CV studies can produce results that reflect the potential problems identified above. However, proponents also assert
that these problems are not inherent to the method and that well-designed and well-executed CV studies can eliminate
them or render them inconsequential. Proponents further assert that survey design, development, and administration
standards will improve quality control for CV surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received many, often conflicting, comments on the use of CV to calculate nonuse values. As the Department
noted in the July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, NOAA convened a panel of economic and survey experts (the NOAA panel), pursuant to its rulemaking authority
under OPA, to evaluate the reliability of CV to measure nonuse values. The NOAA panel issued a report in January, 1993.
58 FR 4601 (Jan. 15, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon consideration of all comments received and the NOAA panel report, the Department is proposing to revise
the type B rule to include standards for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department believes that standards
to improve the reliability of CV surveys of lost nonuse values are needed in the Department's type B rule, because assessments
performed in accordance with the rule will be given a rebuttable presumption in litigation over the specific amount
of money a particular party must pay as compensation for liability. However, this same level of precision for CV surveys
may not necessarily be required for other applications of CV, such as use of CV in regulatory cost-benefit analyses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994, NOAA published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under OPA. 59 FR 1062. Section
990.78(b)(5) of NOAA's proposed rule includes standards for the use of CV. 59 FR 1182&hyph;83; see also 59 FR 1142&hyph;48.
In the interest of consistency and after consultation with other Federal agencies, the Department is soliciting
comment on whether the Department's type B rule should be revised to include standards for the use of CV substantially
similar to those proposed by NOAA. Upon consideration of the comments received in response to this notice, the Department
intends to issue a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's proposed standards for use of CV cover five areas: (1) Survey instrument design and development; (2) survey
administration; (3) the nature of the results; (4) calibration; and (5) reporting. NOAA's proposed standards are
intended to provide flexibility to trustee officials so that they can take advantage of new developments that may
occur in CV methodology. Further, any standards included in the Department's type B rule may be subject to amendment
during the statutorily required biennial review of the regulations to reflect the results of new research.

A. Survey Instrument Design and Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reliability of a CV study begins with the design and development of the survey instrument. NOAA has proposed several
survey instrument design and development standards. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards
should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering
for its type B rule, is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Survey instrument design and development_(A) Willingness to pay for Prevention or Restoration. (1) The survey instrument
shall elicit from respondents their willingness-to-pay (WTP) either to prevent described injuries to natural resources
or to restore injured resources as described to their baseline or comparable condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for selecting a prevention program or restoration program as the
commodity to be valued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Commodity definition. (1) During development of the survey, the trustee(s) shall determine whether respondents
understood and found credible the description of the injuries (including whether they are permanent or interim losses)
and the program (including the timing of the process) for preventing injuries or restoring the natural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Prior to the value elicitation, the trustee(s) shall identify the natural resource context of the injured resources,
if related resources exist, including commodities that might serve as substitutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Budget constraints. Prior to the value elicitation, respondents shall be reminded of their budget constraints
and their alternative expenditures. Respondents shall be reminded that their WTP for the environmental program
in question would reduce their expenditures on other goods. This reminder should be more than perfunctory, but less
than overwhelming. The goal is to induce respondents to keep in mind other likely expenditures, including those on
other environmental goods, when evaluating the main scenario. After the value elicitation, respondents shall be
reminded again of their alternative expenditure possibilities. Respondents shall be given an opportunity to reconsider
and change their votes (bid) after this second reminder of alternative expenditure possibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Comparability with real transactions. (1) The survey instrument shall use a credible choice mechanism and payment
vehicle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The trustee(s) shall select a choice mechanism that is incentive compatible and shall document the rationale
for the selected choice mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The trustee(s) shall ask follow-up questions to determine whether the respondents accepted the choice mechanism
and payment vehicle as credible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (Note: Calibration requirement discussed in Section III.D of this notice)*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Pretesting. (1) Survey development shall include adequate field testing to ensure that the above design criteria
are met. 59 FR 1182&hyph;83. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One important aspect of survey instrument design and development is the selection of a choice mechanism. Past CV studies
have used different methods to elicit values, including open-ended WTP questions; bidding cards; and voting formats
typically termed ``referenda.'' The Department believes that selection of a choice mechanism should be left to the
discretion of trustee officials, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that
the current state of the art shows many advantages for using a voting format as the choice mechanism for CV surveys in
natural resource damage assessments. Therefore, if trustee officials select a choice mechanism other than a voting
format, they should document the factors that led them to reject a voting format. Nevertheless, the Department solicits
comments regarding the incentive compatibility of alternative choice mechanisms and whether the final regulation
or its preamble should state a preference for the voting format. The Department also solicits comments regarding
the administrative and analytical costs associated with alternative choice mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the method of elicitation should be one with which people are familiar and one which provides
a realistic context in which respondents can choose to increase levels of public goods. Local jurisdictions and State
governments often ask voters to increase taxes on themselves so that public goods may be increased (e.g., school bond
issues; special assessments for public infrastructure). Second, in our society, most goods are offered using posted
prices. Asking an individual to reveal his or her maximum WTP for a good is both unfamiliar and unrealistic. Third,
it is important that respondents believe that they will receive the program offered in the CV survey. To CV respondents,
the cost of the program naturally determines the price they must pay. If no set price is offered, the respondents may
perceive uncertainty regarding the program's costs and, therefore, uncertainty regarding the provision of the
program. Finally, the voting format is incentive compatible. Respondents must reveal their preference and vote
for the program if they desire the program at the stated price. Voting against or refusing to vote will only lower the
probability of obtaining the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most carefully designed CV survey can produce unreliable results if the survey administration is faulty. NOAA
has proposed several standards for survey administration. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards
should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering
for its type B rule, is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Survey administration_(A) Sampling procedures. (1) The trustee(s) shall determine the relevant population(s)
to be sampled and document the rationale for that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The trustee(s) shall draw a probability sample(s) from the target population for the administration of the final
survey. Less rigorous sampling is suitable for pretesting and pilot surveys so long as the heterogeneity of the target
population is considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The sample size(s) shall be sufficient to draw statistically significant population inferences and to estimate
WTP valuation functions or to test relevant statistical hypotheses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The trustee(s) shall minimize nonresponse bias to the extent practicable by striving for as high a response rate
in the final survey as possible, consistent with the requirements of reasonable cost. In no case shall the response
rate be less than seventy percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected response rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Mode of administration. (1) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected mode of survey administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If interviewers are used, the survey administration shall be conducted by trained interviewers who are supervised
by experienced interviewer field managers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Regardless of the mode of administration, the trustee(s) shall use an experienced survey research organization
to administer the survey.

(C) Confidentiality. The trustee(s) should ensure respondent confidentiality. 59 FR 1183. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One important aspect of survey administration is the determination of an appropriate response rate. The Department
believes that trustee officials should obtain as high a response rate as possible, consistent with the requirements
of reasonable cost, in order to ensure reliable inferences to the general population. Low response rates pose a risk
of compromising the statistical validity of the survey when nonrespondents have systematically different values
than respondents. Another risk associated with low response rates is that estimates of response variance may be significantly
affected such that the indicated confidence of survey results is questioned. Since the likelihood of these risks
cannot be determined unless nonrespondents have been surveyed, trustee officials should minimize nonresponse
in the final survey to the extent practicable. For example, trustee officials could design the survey instrument
so that individuals must decide whether to respond before the exact nature of the environmental insult is revealed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has proposed that response rates shall not fall below 70 percent. The Department solicits comments on whether
there should be a specified minimum response rate and, if so, whether 70 percent is a reasonable floor. Further, the
Department solicits comments regarding the administrative costs associated with alternative response rates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another important aspect of survey administration is selection of the mode of administration. The three generally
used CV survey administration modes are in-person, mail, and telephone. There are advantages and disadvantages
of each method, and often the selection of the appropriate method is dependent on a number of factors such as cost, turn-around
time, desired response rate, type of information to be conveyed, use of visual aids, required population coverage,
and the ultimate use of the survey results. For example, telephone surveys can approximate simple random sampling
of households through random digit dialing; can produce fast results; are relatively easy to administer; and are
less expensive than in-person interviews. On the other hand, visual aids cannot be used; interviews need to be relatively
short; interviewer bias may be involved; and individuals without telephones are necessarily omitted from the sample.
Self-administered mail surveys are the least costly of the three methods. However, probability sampling is difficult;
respondents can review the survey before deciding to participate (imparting self-selection bias); there can be
no random selection within the household and no control of question sequencing; and a higher number of incomplete
responses are likely to result because there is no interviewer to motivate the respondent. Finally, in-person interviews
permit random selection of the respondent within the household; maintain control of question ordering; allow the
use of visual materials; and generate high response rates. In-person interviews, though, are the most costly method
to administer; require complex field operations; involve the use of many documents and forms (e.g., calling cards,
interviewer evaluation forms, verification forms); and may involve interviewer bias. For a more in-depth discussion
of each method, see EPA, ``Survey Management Handbook,'' vol. II, pp. 24&hyph;35, 230/12&hyph;84&hyph;002, December,
1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that selection of a mode of administration should be left to the discretion of trustee officials,
as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that in-person interviews provide certain
advantages in the natural resource damage assessment context. Therefore, if trustee officials select a mode of administration
other than in-person interviews, they should document the factors that led them to reject in-person interviews.
The Department solicits comments on whether the final regulation or its preamble should state a preference for in-person
interviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While recognizing that mail surveys can provide invaluable information for many academic studies and regulatory
purposes (e.g., the U.S. decennial census), the Department believes that mail surveys at this time lack certain features
that are desirable for use in the natural resource damage assessment context. Telephone surveys also have limitations.
A CV survey designed for natural resource damage assessment purposes is likely to impart a large amount of information
to respondents causing interviews to be lengthy and often complex. In-person interviews offer the opportunity to
motivate the respondents and to hold their interest by providing important information in a graphic and pictorial
format and asking interactive questions regarding the respondents' understanding and acceptance of key features
of the survey instrument. In-person interviews also permit interviewers to record verbatim responses to important
open-ended questions. Such information may be critical in demonstrating that a trustee official has adhered to regulatory
standards for the design and administration of the CV study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also believes that trustee officials should consider the use of modes of administration other than
in-person interviews during the survey instrument development stage. For example, a telephone survey may be an appropriate
and cost-effective method to test a design feature such as question ordering or the understanding of technical terms.
Further, the Department is interested in comparative empirical testing of other administration modes, such as random
digit dialing for initial contacts, followed by mailed descriptive information and visual materials, culminating
with a telephone survey. If such testing demonstrates that other modes can produce the type of information and results
comparable to in-person interviews, the Department would consider encouraging trustee officials to use those methods
for the final survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the mode of administration, the Department believes that all surveys should be administered by a survey
research organization, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. The Department believes that use of a survey research
organization is necessary because the preparation and administration of a general population survey require practical
survey expertise and substantial logistical support. The Department also believes that trustee officials should
select a survey research organization that has implemented procedures to meet the standards outlined in either the
Council of American Survey Research Organizations' Code of Standards for Survey Research or the American Association
for Public Opinion Research's Code of Professional Ethics and Practices. Use of such an organization would help to
maintain reliability and confidentiality. Further, such organizations are likely to have proven track records
and the staff necessary to conduct a survey in accordance with any regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the Department
solicits comments regarding the requirement that surveys be administered by an experienced survey research organization.
Further, comments regarding alternative codes of standards for survey administration are solicited.

A commonly expressed concern about CV is that it can produce results that are not sensitive to all relevant characteristics
of the described natural resource injuries and methods of preventing or restoring the injured resources. NOAA has
proposed a test to address this concern. The Department solicits comment on whether the same test should be included
in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B
rule, is as follows:

Nature of results. (A) Scope test. Controlling for attitudinal, demographic, perceptual, and other differences
across respondents, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate statistically that the aggregate WTP across all respondents
for the prevention or restoration program increases (decreases) as the scope of the environmental insult is expanded
(contracted). The scope of the environmental insult is characterized by the severity of the natural resource injuries
and the level of effectiveness and timing of the restoration or prevention program. The demonstration shall be conducted
through the use of split samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Number of scenarios. The trustee(s) shall administer to split samples different survey instruments containing
three variations of the scope of the environmental insult that respondents perceive as different unless the trustee(s)
can provide a reasonable showing that the three-scenario test is infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack
of plausibility of scenarios. Where three scenarios are feasible, the statistical test shall involve pairwise comparisons.
In either case, the scenarios may vary along any of the margins of intensity, geography, and duration of damage and,
for prevention scenarios, the probability of an event occurring. The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for
the selected variations of the scope of the environmental insult. In determining the descriptions to be used with
the split samples, the trustee(s) shall use realistic injury scenarios and prevention or restoration programs that
the respondents accept as credible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Maximum amount of difference between scenarios. The trustee(s) shall develop scenarios for the total value test.
Prior to the performance of the test, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate that not more than ninety-five percent of respondents
in a pre-test or in focus groups indicate that there are meaningful value differences between the scenarios to be tested
in any pairwise comparison. The demonstration shall be based on a minimum of sixty valid responses. The trustee(s)
shall exclude from this demonstration any individuals who indicate in screening questions that they are not willing
to pay anything for any size environmental cleanup or who would be willing to pay unrealistically large and invariant
amounts for any size environmental cleanup. 59 FR 1183.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this test were included in the Department's type B rule, one important aspect would be the determination of the relevant
dimensions of the scope of the environmental insult. The scope of an environmental insult such as a discharge of oil
or release of a hazardous substance is multi-dimensional, where the dimensions are influenced by biological and
social attributes. A discharge or release can affect all or part of an ecosystem. Its effects can be short- or long-lived,
lethal or sublethal, geographically contained or widely dispersed. From the human perspective, the effects of a
discharge or release may be directly visible and disturbing, or out of sight and perceived only indirectly once there
is knowledge about the loss of natural resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the first phase of NOAA's proposed test, the relevant dimensions of the scope of the discharge or release under investigation
would need to be identified. Once the trustee official had defined the relevant dimensions of scope, the trustee official
would employ a split sampling technique where some respondents were provided with an alternative survey instrument.
The trustee official would begin the analysis with the primary survey instrument that would be used to estimate the
values lost due to the discharge or release in question. This instrument would be designated the base instrument.
Trustee officials would pre-test and perform pilot tests on the instrument to ensure that the instrument met any design
and development standards. Analyses performed using incompletely developed or tested preliminary instruments
would not be considered evaluations of scope sensitivity because in these situations it would not be possible to distinguish
the effects of variations in survey instrument design from the effects of changes in the scope of the injury or proposed
prevention or restoration program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In designing a CV survey instrument, trustee officials would determine the dimensions of scope that were relevant
to the discharge or release under investigation and decide whether there existed a subset of dimensions that were
important to the values being measured or whether all of the dimensions were linked and therefore equally important.
In cases where a subset were deemed important, trustee officials would choose whether to scale these dimensions up
or down in relation to the levels described in the base instrument and by how much to scale the dimensions. If all relevant
dimensions were to be scaled, trustee officials would still decide in which direction and magnitude to scale each
dimension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the trustee officials had decided on the dimensions to be scaled, in what direction and by how much, they would
produce second and third instruments that differed from the base instrument only with respect to the scope dimensions.
Trustee officials could choose to scale dimensions regarding the injury description, dimensions concerning the
prevention or restoration programs offered to respondents, or both. Regardless, trustee officials must take care
to ensure that the expected ordinal change in WTP remains unambiguous when simultaneously scaling different dimensions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope test would be designed to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates. The Department is considering
a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. The first priority in this hierarchy would be to demonstrate the transitivity
of aggregate WTP estimates with respect to the scope of the environmental insult. The second priority would be to demonstrate
the sensitivity of aggregate WTP estimates to both an expansion and a contraction of the environmental insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: One reflecting an expansion of the environmental
insult from that described by the base instrument and the other reflecting a contraction of the environmental insult
from that described by the base instrument. Joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate
WTP estimates were transitive (i.e., A&lt;B and B&lt;C, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that such a test may not be feasible all cases. It may not be feasible in some cases to design
credible alternative instruments reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult.
For those cases, the second most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: Both reflecting either
an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument. Regardless,
joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive (e.g., A&lt;C
and C&lt;B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, it may not be feasible in some cases to determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive
if different dimensions were scaled in the two alternative instruments. For those cases, the third most preferred
test would involve separate pairwise comparisons to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates (e.g.,
A&lt;B and C&lt;B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, it may not be feasible in some cases to design two credible alternative instruments. For those cases, the
test would involve one alternative instrument reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental
insult from that described by the base instrument. This would be the least preferred test. In all cases, trustee officials
would be required to document the rationale for the selected scope test. The Department solicits comments on the need
for and desirability of such a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the scaled instruments were pretested, all three instruments would be employed in a split sample design. Since
inferences to the relevant population would not be part of a scope analysis, true probability sampling would not be
required and convenience samples could be employed so long as random assignment of the different treatments were
maintained. Trustee officials would endeavor to employ large samples in these analyses since changes in scope could
be small and large samples may be needed to attain significant differences in WTP. Trustee officials would be free
to demonstrate sensitivity to scope using statistical techniques of their choosing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The validity of the scope test could depend on the respondents' perception of differences in the scope dimensions
across the three treatments. Trustee officials would include questions that could be used to determine whether respondents
understood and found credible the description of the injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three-scenario approach would not be required when trustee officials provided a reasonable showing that it was
infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack of plausibility of the scenarios. In such circumstances, trustee
officials could perform the analysis using only the original scenario and one alternative scenario. However, as
CV surveys are routinized and their costs fall, trustee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials may find that the three-scenario analysis is feasible in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern has been expressed that differences between the scenarios not be so large that passing the scope test would
be a foregone conclusion, nor so small that it would be very difficult to demonstrate statistical differences without
extremely large (and costly) split samples. The issue is complicated by the possibility, based on the State of Alaska-sponsored
study of the Exxon Valdez spill, that a significant minority of the population may be insensitive to any reasonable
differences in scenarios: Some individuals may not be willing to pay anything for any environmental cleanup, others
may be willing to pay unrealistically high (and invariant) amounts for any size environmental cleanup. In response
to this concern, NOAA has proposed that trustee officials should develop procedures for identifying and eliminating
these responses, so that the demonstration that the scenarios are meaningfully different would rest on the remaining
participants. To accept the scenarios for the scope test, no more than 95 percent of the remaining participants could
indicate that the differences between the scenarios were real and meaningful, i.e. that the values of the respective
commodities differed. The Department is seeking comment on ways to design such a procedure to demonstrate differences
in scenarios, and on alternative schemes to achieve a comparable goal. For example, should ``insensitive'' individuals
be excluded from the survey and, if so, how should such individuals be identified? How should the threshold defining
``meaningful differences'' be characterized? Should the threshold criterion for determining ``meaningful difference''
be adjusted, since individuals impose internal consistency on their answers in the face of direct comparisons (recognizing
much finer differences than in split samples)? Once a procedure has been developed to determine if individuals are
sensitive to the scope of the environmental insult, should this information be incorporated into the selection of
the sample for the scope test? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NOAA's proposed rule would require a split sample with multiple scenarios for demonstrating the scope test,
the Department seeks comment on the option of alternatively using an indirect test to explain variation in WTP as a
function of a set of explanatory variables, including belief in the size of the damage scenario, and/or effectiveness
of the prevention or restoration program. Commenters should consider under what circumstances such an indirect
test should be allowed for performing the scope test. An indirect approach examines the sensitivity to scope indirectly
through the use of a WTP valuation function, relying entirely on the base instrument. In the context of a single dichotomous
choice referendum (or a double-bounded formulation), a WTP valuation function may relate the probability of a yes
vote to a list of variables assumed to underlie the voting decision (e.g., the amount the household is asked to pay,
household demographics, etc.). The indirect approach may expand this list to include variables based on information
collected from respondents that are related to the scope dimensions of the discharge or release. These measures must
be meaningful to the respondent given the information provided in the survey. For example, a useful question following
the WTP elicitation question is one that asks whether the respondent believed the injuries caused by the discharge
or release to be more or less severe than described. All other things being equal (i.e. similar preferences, budget
constraints, etc.), respondents believing the injuries to be worse than described, and having equal confidence
in the prospects for restoring the injured resources through the offered plan, might be willing to pay more. Such a
finding would be an indirect verification of scope sensitivity.

D. Calibration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA has proposed a requirement that trustee officials calibrate WTP values derived from CV studies to ``actual''
WTP. The Department is aware of a number of studies examining the relationship between ``hypothetical'' WTP and ``actual''
WTP. In this work, an effort is made to calibrate hypothetical WTP values derived from CV studies to actual WTP. The
results of this work are not definitive and are based on CV studies of a lower quality survey design than would be required
under NOAA's proposed rule. However, because of uncertainty associated with CV estimates, the Department is soliciting
comment on whether the calibration requirement in NOAA's proposed rule should be included in the Department's type
B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language requiring calibration is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The survey instrument or analysis method shall provide a factor for calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP. The
trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected calibration factor. If the survey instrument or analysis
method fails to provide such a factor or the trustee(s) fails to document the rationale for the selected factor, actual
WTP shall be presumed to be one-half of stated WTP. 59 FR 1183.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As NOAA's preamble recognizes, the proposed default factor was included for the purpose of soliciting comment. 59
FR 1146.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comment on a number of questions regarding the calibration of CV results. Is a calibration requirement
necessary in light of the other proposed standards for survey instrument design and development, survey administration,
and nature of results? Is a calibration requirement warranted given that, but for the difficulties in elicitation,
willingness to accept (WTA) would be a more appropriate measure of damages than WTP? The economics literature concludes
that, for changes in the provision of a public good, the difference between WTA and WTP depends on the availability
of substitute goods. The fewer substitutes available, the greater the difference between WTA and WTP. See W.M. Hanemann,
``Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept: How Much Can They Differ?'' American Economic Review, vol. 81, pp.
635&hyph;647 (1991). This result suggests that WTP may significantly understate WTA, the more appropriate measure
of damages for natural resource injuries. The Department also seeks comment on: The rationale for calibration or
the justification for assuming that hypothetical WTP equals actual WTP; the appropriate default, if any, for a calibration
factor; whether a calibration requirement should be included in a technical information document rather than in
the rule; and whether inclusion of a calibration requirement is consistent with the

 decision upholding the inclusion of all reliably calculated values in a damage assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department solicits comments regarding whether marketing research which attempts to establish relationships
between stated intentions to purchase and actual purchase behavior for private goods is relevant to the calibration
of CV results for natural resource damage assessments. If commenters believe that research to be relevant, additional
comments are solicited regarding the appropriate actual behavior with which similar relationships could be established
the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies. Commenters should explicitly state the behavioral links between
the suggested actual behavior and the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wishes to emphasize to those who support the use of a default calibration factor that they should supply
specific information to support whatever factor they believe the Department should adopt. The adoption of a definite
calibration factor would have to be supported by information in the administrative record.

F. Additional Requests for Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Prior Knowledge
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of conducting a CV study in a natural resource damage assessment is to determine the damages suffered
by the public as a result of a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance into the environment. For consideration
of lost nonuse values, the relevant public may include the entire U.S. population, or may include a regional subset
of the population. Damages may be sustained by each individual in the relevant public, but only a small fraction of
the public will actually participate in the survey. The damages an individual suffers from a discharge or release
depend on many factors. These include the effects of the discharge or release on natural resources, how much the individual
uses the services provided by the injured resources, individual preferences, and the individual's information
about the release or discharge and the world in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting the survey, it is necessary to educate the respondent about the natural resource itself, the facts surrounding
a discharge or release, and the impacts of the discharge or release on the resource. This education process greatly
changes the respondent's information set. Upon gaining this new information, respondents are then asked to place
a value on the losses suffered. There is general agreement that the losses an individual experiences from a discharge
or release after learning the new information are likely to be systematically different than the losses they would
experience prior to learning the new information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters have argued that the fact that the CV method itself actively changes the information set of an individual
prior to valuing the good or service makes it fundamentally different from other economic valuation methodologies.
These commenters have questioned whether it is appropriate to extrapolate value estimates based on post-survey
information to the general population. Given the assessment's objective of estimating damages owed to the public
at large, and the small fraction of the public that actually participates in the survey, some have argued that the relevant
information set for the purposes of extrapolating to the general population is the pre-survey information set. One
way to move towards value estimates that reflect the information set of the general public is to obtain information
in the survey itself regarding the respondents' pre-existing knowledge about the resource and injury to it. Regardless
of the value a respondent states after learning information from the survey, those respondents who were not aware
of the resource or an injury to it or both would be assigned a value of zero. The rationale for assigning a zero value is
that if X percent of the survey respondents did not know about the resource or injury, then X percent of the relevant
public is likely to be similarly uninformed. (Implicit is the assumption that individuals who are unaware of the injury
at the time of the survey would continue unaware, but for the survey, for the foreseeable future.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters have articulated the point of view that the level of respondents' prior information about the injury
is irrelevant to the determination of natural resource damages. According to these commenters, an education process
increases the reliability of CV by exposing respondents to a uniform set of information regarding the characteristics
of the commodity, availability of substitutes, and prices. Consumers undertake a similar education process in private
markets to form their demands for other commodities. In this sense, the education process is necessary so that CV is
not fundamentally different from other valuation methodologies. Further, these commenters have stated that the
fact that an individual is not informed of a specific injury does not mean that he or she suffers no loss as a result of
the injury. Natural resources are held in trust for the public. Therefore, WTA rather than WTP would be the most appropriate
measure of lost values of injured resources, were it not for the technical difficulties involved in eliciting WTA.
Each member of the public has an interest in the injured natural resources being valued regardless of whether he or
she is aware of the particular resources and injuries. Therefore, these commenters believe it would be inappropriate
to require that CV respondents' values only be counted if they were aware of the injured resources before the survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comments on whether it is appropriate to use information regarding pre-existing knowledge
of respondents to reassign to zero any positive values expressed by individuals who were unaware of the injuries prior
to the survey in the calculation of damages. Commenters who believe it is appropriate to assign zero damages to individuals
with limited prior knowledge should articulate the rationale for doing so. Commenters who believe that it is inappropriate
to assign zero damages to individuals with limited prior knowledge should articulate their rationale for using the
post-survey information set to extrapolate damages to a public that only has pre-survey information.

2. Screening or Threshold Factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of concern by many commenters that CV surveys may be undertaken in damage cases where expected damages may
be too small to justify the costs of the CV survey, the Department is seeking comment on the concept of a screening factor
that trustee officials should apply in deciding whether to conduct a CV survey of nonuse values in a particular case.
Factors currently limiting the use of CV include the high costs of surveys to meet NOAA's proposed standards, trustee
budget and staff limitations, and trustee desire for speedy judgment to enable expeditious restoration activities.
To employ an additional screening factor, expected damages might be estimated using a small sample with protocols
designed to minimize survey costs and, therefore, not necessarily subject to the standards contained in NOAA's proposed
rule. Alternatively, expected damages might be estimated by scaling damages estimated in other CV studies. Other
methods may be possible. Several possible thresholds have been suggested. These possibilities include setting
the threshold for a particular case at the greater of twice the expected cost of a full CV survey or the product of multiplying
$5 per household by the number of households expected to hold nonuse values for the resource of concern. The Department
is specifically seeking comment on: Whether such a screening factor would be appropriate; what form a factor might
take; whether the factor should apply to total damages or only to lost nonuse values; and whether inclusion of a screening
factor is consistent with the

IV. Technical Information Document
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a guidance document on use of CV.
This document will provide additional technical information on possible means of satisfying any standards contained
in the damage assessment regulations as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies. Once a draft of the
document has been prepared, the Department will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing its availability and soliciting comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department requests comments on additional tests for determining the reliability of CV estimates for possible
inclusion in the technical information document. In order to evaluate any additional tests, the Department requests
that commenters provide a complete list of the behavioral assumptions underlying their theoretical framework of
rational choice. The Department assumes that commenters will begin with what economists consider to be the generally
accepted axioms of neoclassical consumer choice theory or revealed preference theory. The Department requests
that commenters clearly state all further assumptions underlying the test and describe the sensitivity of the test's
results to the assumptions presented. Second, if commenters are proposing tests that rely on marginal or infra-marginal
changes in the scope of the injuries, the commenters should describe how the variation of scope dimensions involved
in the test would be quantified. Third, and perhaps most important, the Department asks that commenters explain how
any proposed test can be accomplished feasibly within the survey instrument design and development and survey administration
standards specified in NOAA's proposed rule. Tests causing CV surveys to violate these standards are themselves
unreliable tests. Fourth, the commenter should give examples of how these tests would be structured in the context
of a hazardous substance release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, commenters have expressed concern about the valuation of past nonuse losses. The Department believes that
when little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents'
WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since
the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, the Department is soliciting
comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time for possible inclusion in the
technical information document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments on the assessment of lost nonuse values were widely divergent but generally fell into two primary schools
of thought. One set of commenters thought that trustee officials should have the discretion to decide on a case-by-case
basis when lost nonuse values should be included in a damage assessment. These commenters stated that assessment
of lost nonuse values is necessary to ensure that the public is made whole for natural resource injuries. One commenter
noted that inclusion of lost nonuse values in damage assessments is particularly crucial in the case of injuries to
tribal resources because of the special spiritual and cultural significance that natural resources hold for Indian
tribes. Some commenters stated that if the Department does not include provisions for assessing lost nonuse values
in the regulations, then the Department would send inappropriate economic signals to PRPs and could cause risky activities
to be directed toward pristine environments where use values are very low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, this set of commenters thought that CV is a reliable methodology for calculating lost nonuse values. Some
of these commenters stated that studies purporting to demonstrate that CV produces unreliable results have failed
to distinguish between well and poorly designed CV surveys. A few of these commenters took issue with the Department's
discussion in the July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of the potential for bias in CV studies. Some commenters stated that the Department had failed to recognize
that the real bias lies in using methodologies that consistently undervalue public losses by computing compensable
value based solely on lost use values. Other commenters questioned the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that although all valuation methodologies have potential reliability problems, CV, when used to estimate
lost nonuse values, poses more significant problems because the per-person bias is multiplied by a larger population.
These commenters thought that the Department's line of reasoning, if taken to its logical extreme, would dictate
the nonsensical result that only small values should be measured. A number of commenters made reference to the report
issued by the NOAA panel. According to these commenters, the NOAA panel report concluded that CV can produce reliable
estimates of lost nonuse values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other set of commenters thought that the rule should not include any provisions for the assessment of lost nonuse
values. These commenters stated that assessment of lost nonuse values is not necessary to compensate the public because
trustee officials already have the discretion to assess lost use values in addition to the cost of restoring, rehabilitating,
replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. These commenters stated that assessment of
lost nonuse values was inconsistent with general legal principles designed to prevent speculative damages. For
example, the commenters noted that courts only allow certain categories of individuals to recover damages for pain
and suffering in tort cases. Other commenters stated that allowing assessment of lost nonuse values would be punitive
because it amounts to charging PRPs for hurting the public's feelings. Some commenters expressed concern that allowing
assessment of nonuse values could drive companies out of business and cause an increase in consumer prices. A few commenters
expressed skepticism that nonuse values were actually economic values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This set of commenters also thought that CV cannot reliably calculate nonuse values. These commenters stated that
the results of CV studies are inconsistent with rational decisionmaking. For example, a number of commenters cited
CV surveys in which stated WTP did not respond to increases in the commodity being valued. Some commenters stated that
the results of CV surveys are overly sensitive to the wording and administration of the survey instrument. Several
commenters thought that CV results seem unrealistically high compared to actual contributions to environmental
causes. Some commenters stated that such disparities result because CV respondents do not adequately consider their
budget constraints when determining their WTP. A number of commenters thought that responses to CV surveys were likely
to reflect feelings of vengeance toward PRPs or the warm glow of supporting a worthy cause rather than the respondents'
actual WTP to prevent injury to the specific resources in question. Other commenters noted that CV studies require
respondents to perform difficult valuation tasks with which they have little prior experience. A few commenters
expressed particular concern about the public's ability to provide accurate values for injuries in industrial areas
where contamination may exist that is unrelated to the release in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters provided citations to studies purporting to demonstrate the unreliability of CV. A number of commenters
stated that even some CV practitioners have called CV experimental. Other commenters noted that the NOAA panel did
not conclude that CV could produce estimates of lost nonuse values that were reliable enough to be granted a rebuttable
presumption. Rather, according to these commenters, the NOAA panel stated that even if a CV study met a number of strict
standards, it would only be reliable enough to serve as a starting point in litigation. Therefore, these commenters
thought that even if the Department allowed CV to be used to estimate lost nonuse values, it should not grant the results
of CV studies of lost nonuse values a rebuttable presumption. Finally, most of the commenters who thought that CV was
unreliable when used to estimate lost nonuse values also thought that this unreliability was the result of fundamental
flaws that economists do not know how to correct at this time.

held that the Department's type B rule should allow for the recovery of all reliably calculated lost values of injured
resources, including lost nonuse values. 880 F.2d at 464. Therefore, the focus of this notice is not whether lost nonuse
values per se are an appropriate component of a natural resource damage assessment. This notice addresses whether
lost nonuse values can be reliably calculated and, if so, under what conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department acknowledges that a poorly designed or administered CV study, like any poorly designed or administered
valuation study, can produce unreliable results. However, based on the evidence received to date, the Department
does not believe that CV is a fundamentally flawed methodology. The Department believes that a properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and administered CV study can produce reliable estimates of lost nonuse values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also believes that the results of a CV study of lost nonuse values performed in accordance with whatever
standards are ultimately included in the type B rule should receive a rebuttable presumption. CERCLA provides that
the natural resource damage assessment regulations are to identify the best available procedures and that assessments
performed in accordance with the regulations receive a rebuttable presumption.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were numerous comments on possible guidance for the conduct of CV studies. A few commenters thought that guidance
was unnecessary. Most commenters, though, thought that some guidance was advisable. A number of commenters, noting
that NOAA is developing standards based on the NOAA panel report, suggested that the Department postpone development
of guidance until NOAA evaluates the report and issues a proposed rule. Some commenters thought that the Department
should incorporate NOAA's rulemaking record before deciding on guidance. Other commenters urged the Department
to make any proposed guidance available for public review and comment before issuing a final rule.

The Department believes that standards for the use of CV should be included in the type B rule to improve reliability.
The Department does not think it is advisable to incorporate NOAA's rulemaking record because that record covers
a wide range of issues beyond CV. However, the Department did consider the NOAA panel report. Also, numerous commenters
on the Department's July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice submitted copies of comments they had provided to NOAA on its rulemaking. The Department agrees that commenters
should have an adequate opportunity to review and comment on the standards being considered for the use of CV; therefore,
the Department has issued this notice. The Department invites commenters on NOAA's proposed rule to submit comments
to the Department on this proposed rule as well.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters responded to the Department's request for suggestions on the content of possible guidance
on the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. Several commenters suggested that the Department adopt some or all
of the standards contained in the NOAA panel report. Some commenters thought that the Department should include both
the standards in the NOAA panel report and additional standards. Other commenters offered their own standards. The
suggested standards covered six major areas: restrictions on the type of resource for which lost nonuse values could
be assessed; restrictions on the relevant population; protection against the influence of improper motives; standards
for ensuring that respondents consider all relevant factors when estimating their WTP; standards for determining
whether CV results are consistent with basic tenets of rationality; and methods of calibrating CV results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters thought that assessment of lost nonuse values should be limited to cases where there have been long-lasting
injuries to resources with few substitutes. These commenters stated that such a limitation was necessary to prevent
speculative claims. These commenters also agreed with the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that in cases where injuries are of short duration and where the injured resources have many substitutes, nonuse
losses are likely to be minimal. Other commenters objected to such a limitation noting that there is no empirical evidence
that there cannot be a loss of nonuse values in cases where injuries are of short duration or where there are many substitutes
for the injured resources. These commenters also noted that such a restriction is unrelated to reliability. Some
commenters stated that such a limitation might prevent assessment of lost nonuse values where individual animals
had been killed but overall population levels were unaffected. These commenters stated that the public may well experience
nonuse losses for the death of the individual animals since each individual animal is, in some sense, irreplaceable.

A number of commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to limit the relevant population to those persons
with prior knowledge of the release or discharge and the affected resources. These commenters thought that if individuals
did not have prior knowledge of the injury, then they could not have experienced a loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Department develop standards to protect against the influence of improper
motives. These commenters expressed concern that respondents might provide answers based on the warm glow of supporting
a worthy cause rather than their WTP for injury prevention or resource restoration. These commenters also thought
that the Department should ensure that respondents are not motivated by vengeance against PRPs. In particular, some
commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to demonstrate that the results of a CV study do not change
if respondents are asked their WTP to prevent a naturally occurring injury rather than an injury resulting from human
activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters thought that, given the novelty of the task they are asked to perform, CV respondents are unlikely
to consider all relevant factors on their own. Therefore, these commenters suggested that respondents be reminded
of their budget constraints and the availability of substitutes for the resources being valued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous commenters thought there should be standards for determining whether CV studies produce results consistent
with the basic tenets of rationality. For example, several commenters thought that WTP should increase as the amount
of the commodity being valued increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that the Department should develop guidance on how to calibrate hypothetical WTP with
actual WTP. Some commenters suggested that trustee officials attempt to collect actual funds from CV respondents
and use the results to calibrate stated WTP. Other commenters thought that the Department should develop a formula
for calibrating WTP based on a ratio between lost use values and lost nonuse values.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has carefully reviewed the standards offered by the commenters and the standards included in the NOAA
panel report. The Department does not believe that assessment of lost nonuse values should be restricted only to cases
involving long-lasting injuries to resources with few substitutes. The Department believes that such a restriction
would not address the reliability of CV and, therefore, would be inconsistent with

Interior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to restricting the relevant population to persons with prior knowledge of the discharge or release and
the affected resources, the Department has decided to solicit additional comment, as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to improper motive, the Department finds no evidence to suggest that warm glow and vengeance are necessarily
prevalent in CV studies. The Department believes that when CV respondents are asked their WTP in a credible context
they are adequately focused on the commodity of injury prevention or resource restoration rather than some other
commodity such as the warm glow of giving or vengeance toward PRPs. NOAA's proposed rule includes a requirement that
trustee officials use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive compatible. Further, the Department believes
that vengeance is not a prevalent motivation in a CV study in which respondents are asked how much they would be willing
to pay rather than how much a PRP should be required to pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that CV respondents may not always consider every relevant factor on their own. NOAA's proposed
rule would require that the survey instrument place the commodity to be valued in the context of related natural resources.
NOAA's proposed rule would also require respondents to be reminded of their budget constraints prior to being asked
their WTP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also agrees that questions of unreliability arise when studies produce results that are inconsistent
with basic tenets of rationality. NOAA's proposed rule includes a standard to ensure that CV survey responses satisfy
one important tenet of rationality, namely that WTP increases as the severity of the injuries or the level of effectiveness
and timing of the restoration or prevention program increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP, NOAA's proposed rule includes a calibration requirement.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters responded to the Department's request for comment on the proper placement of any guidance developed
for the use of CV. Some commenters thought that any guidance developed by the Department should be placed in the preamble
or in a guidance document. These commenters noted that CV is an evolving methodology and expressed concern that placing
guidance in the rule could lock in standards that might soon be found to be ill-advised. Other commenters thought that
detailed standards should be placed in the rule itself to minimize the risk of unreliable studies being given a rebuttable
presumption. Some commenters thought that the establishment of clear standards in the rule was particularly important
since there are no generally accepted standards among CV practitioners. These commenters noted that any standards
placed in the rule could be updated during biennial reviews.

 The Department believes that poorly designed and administered CV studies can pose reliability problems. Therefore,
the Department believes that standards for the use of CV should be included in the rule itself to improve the reliability
of CV studies that receive a rebuttable presumption. However, the Department recognizes that CV is an evolving methodology.
Therefore, the Department believes that only those standards that are unlikely to change over time should be included
in the rule and that trustee officials should be given some flexibility in determining how to meet these standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as discussed above, the Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a technical
information document on the use of CV. This document will provide additional technical information on possible means
of satisfying any standards contained in the rule as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies.

 The Department agrees that PRPs should have access to all assessment data collected by trustee officials, including
any data collected in a CV study. Section 11.90 of the Department's existing type B rule provides that at the conclusion
of an assessment, trustee officials must prepare a Report of Assessment that is presented to the PRP. The Report of
Assessment includes all test results. NOAA's proposed rule provides that the report of a CV study must include a discussion
of the relevant factors identified in the standards pertaining to survey instrument design and development, survey
administration, and nature of results, as well as a copy of the survey instrument. If the same standards were added
to the Department's type B rule, the report of the CV study would be included in the Report of Assessment. Also, under
&sect;11.91(c) of the Department's existing type B rule, everything in the administrative record of the assessment,
including all data collected in a CV survey, would be available for review during the judicial discovery process.

 A few commenters noted that WTA, not WTP, is the correct theoretical measure of lost resource values. These commenters

The Department maintains that willingness to pay and willingness to accept are both theoretically valid criteria
for estimating damages to nonmarketed natural resources. In addition, the Department continues to maintain that
willingness to accept may be the criterion most germane to natural resource damages, since the public has the property
right to the injured natural resource. However, the Department also agrees with many of the comments that recognize
that the application of the willingness-to-accept criterion can lead to more technical difficulties and uncertainties
than the willingness-to-pay criterion. 51 FR 27721.

 Some commenters stated that if the Department allows assessment of lost nonuse values, it should also require trustee
officials to assess the benefits to society of the activity giving rise to the release or discharge and claim only the
net loss.

 When Congress passed CERCLA and CWA it decided that parties responsible for hazardous substance releases or oil discharges
should compensate the public for the resulting natural resource damages, notwithstanding the possible societal
benefits of the activities giving rise to the release. CERCLA and CWA were designed to ensure full compensation for
natural resource damages resulting from hazardous substance releases or oil discharges. Nothing in the statutes
suggests that trustee officials are required to assess the benefits to society of the activity giving rise to the release
or discharge and claim only the net loss. Further, many of these benefits are already accounted for in current market
activity whereas the costs of the associated release or discharge are not.

regardless of whether it is explicitly listed, provided it measures the public's WTP and satisfies the criteria set
forth in &sect;11.83(a)(2). 59 FR 14286. The Department is currently unaware of any methodology available for the
express purpose of estimating economically valued nonuse losses of specific injured resources, other than CV, that
meets these specifications.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters thought that if assessment of lost nonuse values is allowed, the Department should restrict such
assessment to present and future values.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents'
WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since
the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, as discussed above,
the Department is soliciting comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time
for possible inclusion in a technical information document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters requested that the Department clarify that even if a CV study of lost nonuse values met any conditions
set forth in the natural resource damage assessment regulations, it would still have to meet judicial standards for
admissibility of evidence. Some commenters cited case law for the proposition that CV studies of lost nonuse values
do not meet judicial standards for admissibility of evidence.

 mandate that the natural resource damage assessment regulations include the best available procedures for reliably
calculating lost values of injured resources. Therefore, the Department believes that any CV study of lost nonuse
values performed in accordance with these regulations should satisfy judicial standards for admissibility of evidence.

The Department is unaware of any case that has held CV studies per se to be inadmissible in court.

 addressed the use of a particular CV study in a case where the natural resource damage assessment regulations were
not followed. The study had been conducted not for the purposes of the specific case but rather to guide a utility council
in making operational changes in a hydropower system. Slip op. at 20. The court did not rule that the study was inadmissible.
However, the court did find that the study was not sufficiently persuasive to sustain the claim for lost nonuse values,
noting that the survey questions were aimed at doubling fish runs from 2.5 million to 5 million whereas only 1,688 fish
had actually been lost due to the specific release in question. Id.

The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no further analysis pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act (43 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department certifies that this rule will not have significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The rule provides technical procedural guidance
for the assessment of damages to natural resources. It does not directly impose any additional cost. As the rule applies
to natural resource trustees, it is not expected to have an effect on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval
by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to constitute a significant
regulatory action. However, because of the difficulty of evaluating the effects of alternatives to this rule, the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget has waived preparation of
the assessments described in sections 6(a)(3)(B) and 6(a)(3)(C) of Executive Order 12866 for the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule does not have takings implications under Executive Order 12630. The Department
has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections
2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. It has been determined that this rule does not have federalism implications
under Executive Order 12612.

This stage involves proposed small&hyph;scale content tests to evaluate changes made to the new instrument in earlier
pretests. The content tests will involve two waves of interviews to be conducted at an estimated 400 households. The
objectives of these content tests are: to evaluate the improved wording and ordering of the instrument over what was
implemented during the pretests; and to further test the total integration of the instrument; observe field interviewing
techniques through laptop management application; assess the case management system's ability to assign, accept,
and transfer cases; and test closeout activities and post&hyph;closeout data preparations.

The October Current Population Survey (CPS) supplement is the only source of data on enrollment in all schools by demographic,
social, and economic characteristics. This annual supplement provides school enrollment data for persons 3 years
old or older who are enrolled in elementary school, high school, college, and vocational/technical schools, as well
as for children enrolled in nursery schools and kindergarten. It also provides higher education data for adults and
computer usage data for adults and children. These data are collected from each household from both the full regular
CPS sample and the CATI/CAPI Overlap sample. The data are used by Federal agencies; state, county, and city governments;
and private organizations responsible for education to formulate and implement education policy. They are also
used by employers and analysts to anticipate the composition of the labor force in the future.

Foreign-Trade Zone 146; Lawrenceville, IL; Proposed Reorganization and Expansion of Foreign-Trade Subzones 146A
&amp; 146B North American Lighting, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Motor Vehicle Lighting Products) Flora, IL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Bi-State Authority, grantee
of FTZ 146, Lawrenceville, Illinois, requesting authority for reorganization of and the expansion of zone activity
at Subzone 146A and Subzone 146B at the North American Lighting, Inc. (NAL), facilities in Flora, Illinois, and the
inclusion of a new facility in Salem, Illinois, as part of the reorganized subzone. The application was submitted
pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations
of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on April 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subzones 146A and 146B were approved by the Board in 1988 for two adjacent manufacturing plant sites of NAL, both of
which are located within the Flora Industrial Park, Flora, Illinois (Board Order 371, 53 FR 5436, 2&hyph;24&hyph;88).
The two facilities (222,000 sq.ft./14 acres) were granted subzone authority to manufacture motor vehicle lighting
components and other related auto parts. Subzone 146B was formerly operated by Hella Electronics, Inc., a NAL affiliate.
Both plants are now operated as an integrated manufacturing unit by NAL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAL has added a third manufacturing site (380,000 sq. ft. on 22 acres), located in the Salem Industrial Park, 1075 West
Main Street, Salem (Marion County), Illinois (30 miles west of Flora), which would become part of the reorganized
zone. Construction is underway at the Flora facilities which will increase manufacturing space to 355,000 square
feet. The completed expansion will yield a combined production capacity of some 28 million units annually. Based
on the restructured management of the operations, the applicant requests that all three manufacturing facilities
be consolidated under one subzone designation_146A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production activity that would occur within the consolidated subzone would be essentially the same as that currently
occurring at the Flora facilities. The finished products would involve motor vehicle lighting components. Materials
purchased from abroad include: various polymers and resins in primary form (HTSUS Ch. 39), articles of rubber and
plastic, fasteners, optical elements of glass, certain electrical apparatus, lamps and lenses, insulated wire,
optical fiber and cable/bundles (duty rates: free-16%, 3.1&cent;/kg+9%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zone procedures exempt NAL from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production. On domestic
sales, the company is able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished automotive lighting equipment and parts
(free-10%) for the foreign components noted above. The auto duty rate (2.5%) applies if the finished products are
shipped via zone-to-zone transfer to U.S. motor vehicle assembly plants with subzone status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July
5, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to July 18, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In accordance with &sect;&sect;353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman,
in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with &sect;&sect;353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the
Commerce regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.

The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 8, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by Slater Steels Corporation, Specialty Alloys Division
(petitioner), a U.S. producer of stainless steel angle. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioner alleges
that imports of stainless steel angle from Japan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than
fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are
materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under
section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product
subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section
771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file written notification
with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty
order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of the publication of this notice. The procedures
and requirements are contained in 19 CFR 353.14.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless steel angle'' includes hot-rolled, whether or not annealed
or descaled, stainless steel products angled at 90 degrees, that are not otherwise advanced. The stainless steel
angle subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.40.30.20, and 7222.40.30.60
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience
and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

United States Price and Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based U.S. price (USP) on prices contained in a November 1993 price list for subject merchandise sold by
an unrelated U.S. importer and reseller of Japanese stainless steel angle to its U.S. customer. Since these prices
were quoted ex-dock, duty paid, petitioner deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance,
harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner used tax-exclusive, delivered prices of subject merchandise sold in Japan by three Japanese producers
during the month of September 1993, as the basis for foreign market value (FMV). These prices were obtained from a market
research report and pertained to the following three Japanese producers: Aichi Steel Works, Daido Steel and Sumitomo
Metal Industries. To calculate an ex-factory price, petitioner used expense information from the market research
report. Petitioner converted the home market prices to U.S. dollars based on the monthly average yen/dollar exchange
rate effective during the month of the U.S. sale, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Petitioner deducted
from FMV an amount for inland freight. Petitioner made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in imputed
credit costs between Japanese and U.S. sales based on the average payment period identified in the foreign market
research report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margins alleged by petitioner for stainless steel angle from Japan
range from 40.82 percent to 58.81 percent.

Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by May 23, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication
that imports of stainless steel angle from Japan are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.
A negative ITC determination will result in this investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

Termination of Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 20, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published its Final Determination of Sales at Less
Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon and Alloy Steel Wire Rod from Canada in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 18791). In a letter dated April 18, 1994, petitioner notified the Department of the withdrawal of its April 23,
1993, petition and requested termination of the antidumping investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.17(a), upon the petitioner's withdrawal of the petition, the Department may terminate
an investigation after notice to all parties to the proceeding and after consultation with the International Trade
Commission (ITC). Furthermore, the Department may not terminate an investigation unless it concludes that termination
is in the public interest. All parties to the proceeding have been notified of the petitioner's withdrawal and we have
consulted with the ITC. No objections were received regarding termination of the investigation. In addition, we
have concluded that termination of the investigation is in the public interest. Accordingly, we are terminating
the antidumping investigation of certain alloy and carbon steel wire rod from Canada. This action is taken pursuant
to section 734(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces receipt of experimental fishing permit (EFP) applications from Terra Marine Research and Education
(TMRE), and Coastal Villages Fishing Cooperative (CVFC) and Golden Age Fisheries (GAF). TMRE requests approval
of an EFP to retain salmon caught incidentally in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) during the 1994 pollock
``B'' and the 1995 pollock ``A'' season fisheries and the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod trawl fishery. The purpose
is to assess whether the quantities of salmon donated to a foodbank program are sufficient to justify the costs associated
with the processing and shipping of the product. CVFC and GAF request approval of an EFP to assess the feasibility of
the establishment of an inshore fishery in the Kuskokwim Bay in the BSAI by the residents of this area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and its implementing regulations specify that EFPs may be issued to authorize fishing
that otherwise would be prohibited by the FMP and regulations. The procedures for issuing permits are contained in
the regulations at &sect;675.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EFP applications submitted by TMRE, CVFC, AND GAF have been accepted for review and copies were forwarded to the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). The Council reviewed these applications at its April 18&hyph;22,
1994, meeting, which was held in Anchorage, AK. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TMRE proposes to assess the feasibility of a voluntary donation of salmon caught incidentally in the directed 1994
pollock ``B'' and the 1995 pollock ``A'' season fisheries and the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod trawl fishery for
the purpose of distribution to foodbanks. CVFC and GAF propose to assess the commercial feasibility of fishing for
groundfish in the Kuskokwim Bay by the residents of this area by establishing a 500 metric ton allocation of groundfish
in this area during the period May 1 through September 30, 1994. Vessels participating in these EFPs will accommodate
a NMFS-certified observer at all times with costs paid for by operators of vessels fishing for the applicants. Information
regarding project design, disposition of fish harvested, and other matters is contained in the applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The applicant proposes to take by inadvertent harassment, up to several times daily, a maximum of 1,000 minke whales,
400 blue whales, 100 fin whales, 50 sei whales, 600 humpback whales, 500 gray whales, and 300 killer whales per year
for 5 years for photo-identification purposes. A minimum population size estimate for the minke whale stocks under
investigation will be generated from the total of individually identified whales. Of the number requested above,
150 minke whales, and 30 individuals of each of the remaining baleen whale species are requested for biopsy darting
to collect blubber and skin samples to examine trophic level relationships with prey and among whale species, and
to conduct genetic analysis. Individually identified whales are intended to be sampled once every 30 days, but not
more than 12 times. A maximum of five individuals from each pod of killer whales encountered in the Gulf of the Farallones
will be biopsied only once. The research will be centered in and around the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary
from Bodega Bay to Point Sur, California, but will range opportunistically from the Gulf of Alaska to the California/
Mexican border.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy has issued a study comparing the transportation alternatives for the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant (WIPP) transuranic waste shipping campaign in support of the disposal phase at the WIPP facility. The study
compares truck and train transport, including the use of dedicated trains. The study includes a consideration of
the following elements in association with each transportation mode: occupational and public risks and exposures,
other environmental impacts, emergency response capabilities, and an estimation of comparative costs. The report
is available upon request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
WIPP is a research and development facility located in Southeastern New Mexico with the mission to demonstrate the
safe disposal of transuranic radioactive wastes resulting from defense activities and programs of the United States.
The study describes relevant transportation requirements and responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Energy,
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Responsibilities of States,
local governments, and Indian tribes are also included. The proposed transportation system is discussed which includes:
The shipping containers to be used, the transportation fleet, shipment options, waste volumes, training, and the
transportation tracking system. Risk analysis data is represented in the study in terms of occupational health and
public exposure risks, as well as environmental impacts associated with the proposed WIPP shipping campaign. Emergency
response capabilities for accidents involving radioactive materials for the states through which transuranic
waste will be transported during the disposal phase are outlined. Finally, cost comparative data is presented for
transportation by truck, regular train, and dedicated train.

<RINDOCK>Docket No. PL94&hyph;1&hyph;000 (previously docketed as Docket No. RM94&hyph;12&hyph;000) </RINDOCK>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
April 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 30, 1994, the Commission issued a notice (59 FR 16198, April 6, 1994) scheduling a public conference on May
26, 1994 in RM94&hyph;12&hyph;000 to examine the use of pricing differential mechanisms by interstate natural gas
pipelines to recover gas supply realignment costs. The Commission is redocketing this proceeding as Docket No. PL94&hyph;1&hyph;000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conference, the Commission would be interested in hearing commenters' views on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The pricing differential mechanisms were designed to lessen the pipelines' costs of renegotiating gas supply
contracts. The theory was that providing pipelines a means to honor existing contracts while they were being renegotiated
would be less expensive for consumers than requiring contracts to be bought out immediately. Has this theory been
validated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How are the pricing differential cost (PDC) mechanisms functioning? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. What impact, if any, do the PDC mechanisms have on pipelines' renegotiations with producers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. While the pipelines have been recovering PDCs, what percentage of their overall contract volumes and costs have
been finally resolved? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What impact, if any, does the two-year authorization have on the use of the PDC mechanisms? What type of review should
the Commission undertake to evaluate specific PDC mechanisms if a pipeline seeks to extend the authorization? If
the Commission were to extend a pipeline's 2-year authorization period, what effect would that have on your response
to question 1? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Are there alternatives to the PDC mechanisms? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. If so what are they? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. What impact would these alternatives have on the timing of cost recovery? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. There are various procedural ways the Commission can deal with subsequent quarterly PDC filings where the first
filing has been set for hearing. Possible alternative approaches include: establishing new hearings; consolidating
new filings with the existing hearing; or, making subsequent filings subject to the first proceeding. Are there other
approaches that should also be considered? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On January 24, 1994 and March 16, 1994, PowerNet G.P. (PowerNet) submitted for filing a rate schedule under which PowerNet
will engage in wholesale electric power and energy transactions as a marketer. PowerNet also requested waiver of
various Commission regulations. In particular, PowerNet requested that the Commission grant blanket approval
under 18 CFR part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by PowerNet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 22, 1994, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director, Division of Applications, Office of Electric Power
Regulation, granted requests for blanket approval under 18 CFR part 34, subject to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within thirty days of the date of the order, any person desiring to be heard or to protest the blanket approval of issuances
of securities or assumptions of liability by PowerNet should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absent a request for hearing within this period, PowerNet is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations
or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided
that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of the applicant, and compatible
with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely
affected by continued approval of PowerNet's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Take notice that on April 15, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (``Tennessee'') filed an application pursuant
to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act and &sect;&sect;157.7(a) and 157.18 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(``Commission'') Regulations for authorization to abandon Tennessee's Rate Schedule X&hyph;67, a transportation
and exchange service with Arkla Energy Resources Company (formerly Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This transportation and exchange service was previously certificated on November 15, 1994, under Docket No. CP84&hyph;248&hyph;000
(29 FERC &para;61,184) and, according to Tennessee and Arkla, has been inactive and is no longer necessary. No facilities
will be abandoned as a result of the abandonment of this service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make protest with reference to said application should, on or before May 12, 1994,
file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance
with the requirement of the Commission's Rules or Practices and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining
the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person
wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file in motion to intervene
in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take notice that on April 22, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas
77251, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;372&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct a new delivery point
under TGPL's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;426&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL proposes to construct a new delivery point to Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) in Mecklenburg County,
North Carolina. TGPL states that the new delivery point, referred to as the ``Hicks Crossroads Meter Station'', will
consist of a sixteen-inch tap on TGPL's Main Line ``C'', a sixteen-inch tap on Main Line ``D'' and a new metering and
regulating station, all located approximately at milepost 5.0 on TGPL's Cowan Ford Loop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that the Hicks Crossroads Meter Station will be used by Piedmont to receive into its distribution system
up to 204,000 Mcf of gas per day on a firm and/or interruptible basis TGPL states that it has sufficient system delivery
flexibility to accomplish these deliveries without detriment or disadvantage to TGPL's other customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL further states that it is not proposing to alter the total volumes authorized for delivery to Piedmont. TGPL also
states that the addition of such delivery point will have no impact on TGPL's peak day deliveries and little or no impact
on TGPL's annual deliveries, and is not prohibited by TGPL's FERC Gas Tariff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that the construction and operation of its facilities will comply with the environmental requirements
set forth in &sect;157.206(d) of the Commission's regulations, and that TGPL will obtain all required clearances
prior to the commencement of any construction work in the vicinity of the delivery point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on April 25, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) tendered for filing as part of its
FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet, with a proposed effective date of April 25,
1994:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 6, 1994, the Commission issued its Order on Rehearing and Terminating Technical Conference, in the above-referenced
proceedings, directing Transwestern within thirty days to file revised tariff sheets to reflect the removal of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) $4,200,000 of producer pricing settlement amounts,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) $2,219,314 of prior period adjustments, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) $510,146 from Transwestern's direct bill to its former sales customers, and to refund with interest all the costs
excluded from its Account No. 191 direct bill filings (August 6 order). In the August 6 order, the Commission specifically
provided that Transwestern would be permitted to propose ``a prospective charge to recover these costs from its current
open access transportation customers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern requested rehearing of the August 6 order and, in addition, filed motions requesting additional time
with which to comply with the requirements of the August 6 order, which extensions were granted by the Commission.
On March 25, 1994, the Commission issued its ``Order Denying Rehearing,'' directing Transwestern to comply with
the requirements of the August 6 order and reiterated that Transwestern could file to recover the disallowed costs
through a mechanism that does not constitute a surcharge to its ``former sales customers based upon their past sales
contract demand'' (``March 25 order''). Accordingly and without waiving its rights to file an alternate rate mechanism
to recover the disallowed costs, Transwestern is filing a revised tariff sheet in compliance with the August 6 and
March 25 orders. The only changes Transwestern is proposing in Sheet No. 5M are to adjust the direct bill amounts in
accordance with such orders and to explain in footnote one that section 24, ``Gas Supply Inventory Charge'', has been
canceled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern requested any waiver of any Commission Regulation and its tariff provisions as may be required to allow
the tariff sheet referenced above to become effective on April 25, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions,
and all parties to this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before May 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.
This notice announces receipt of 9 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Regional Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has determined that the aquifer underlying Molokai, Hawaii is the sole or principal source of drinking
water for the island. The Regional Administrator has determined that contamination of this aquifer would create
a significant hazard to public health. As a result of this determination, Federally financially assisted projects
constructed anywhere in the designated area will be subject to EPA review to ensure that they do not contaminate the
aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.

. After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for Federal financial assistance (through a contract, loan
guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate
such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for Federal
financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project
to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer.

In 1987, EPA delegated authority to designate Sole Source Aquifers to EPA Regional Administrators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 23, 1993, Sarah Sykes submitted a petition for Sole Source Aquifer Designation to EPA Region 9. After Sarah
Sykes submitted additional information pursuant to EPA's request, EPA determined the petition to be complete on
September 29, 1993. EPA conducted a public hearing on Molokai, Hawaii on January 6, 1994. The public comment period
on the petition closed on January 21, 1994.

II. Basis for Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The factors to be considered by the Regional Administrator in the designation of an area under section 1424(e) of the
Safe Drinking Water Act are: (1) Whether the aquifer is the area's sole or principal source of drinking water and; (2)
whether contamination of the aquifer would create a significant hazard to public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the information available to EPA, the Regional Administrator has made the following findings which
are the basis for the determination: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The aquifer underlying Molokai currently serves as the sole or principal source of drinking water for the residents
of the island. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contamination of the aquifer would create a significant hazard to public health. There is no economically feasible
alternative drinking water source or combination of sources near the designated area. Potential sources of contamination
include: cesspools, landfills, and highway accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The determination of the boundary of the Sole Source Aquifer is consistent with EPA's Sole Source Aquifer designation
Decision Process: Petition Review Guidance (Office of Groundwater Protection, 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Description of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Molokai Sole Source Aquifer underlies the entire island of Molokai, Maui County, Hawaii. The aquifer is largely
constituted by igneous rocks formed by numerous lava flows. Fresh to brackish groundwater flows within the igneous
rocks in a lens-shaped configuration under Molokai. Lateral groundwater flow is locally impounded by near vertical
dikes. These dikes form relatively impermeable compartments of groundwater at elevations above the island-wide
lens. Yields from wells on Molokai range from 0.5 to 1.8 million gallons per day.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Information Used in the Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information used in the determination includes the petition and the amended petition as submitted by Sarah Sykes.
In addition, the determination is based on EPA's ``Technical Support Document.'' The Technical Support Document
is based on reviews of hydrogeologic studies conducted on Molokai. These documents are available to the public and
may be inspected during business hours at the EPA, Water Management Division, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco,
California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Project Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA region 9 will seek to work with the Federal agencies that may in the future provide financial assistance to projects
within the boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. EPA will seek to develop agreements with other Federal agencies
whereby EPA will be notified of proposed commitments of Federal financial assistance for projects which could contaminate
the aquifer. In the event that a Federal financially assisted project could contaminate the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer
through its recharge zone so as to create a hazard to public health, no commitment of Federal financial assistance
will be made. However, a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision
of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to insure it will not contaminate the aquifer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the project review process cannot be delegated, EPA will consider, to the maximum extent possible, any existing
or future state, tribal, and local control mechanisms in protecting the groundwater quality of the aquifer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received six letters during the comment period. Sixteen people spoke at the public hearing at Kaunakakai, Molokai,
Hawaii on January 6, 1994. Of those who expressed an opinion, six supported the designation of a Sole Source Aquifer
for Molokai, whereas one opposed a designation. The public's written and oral comments are fully addressed in EPA's
Responsiveness Summary which is available to the public during normal business hours at EPA, Water Management Division,
75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Economic and Regulatory Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the attached
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of this certification,
the term ``small entity'' shall have the same meaning as given in Section 601 of the RFA. This action is only applicable
to the area within the boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. The only affected entities will be those businesses,
organizations, or governmental jurisdictions that request Federal financial assistance for projects which have
the potential for contaminating the aquifer so as to create a significant hazard to public health. EPA does not expect
to be reviewing small, isolated commitments of financial assistance on an individual basis; accordingly, the number
of affected small entities will be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those small entities which may be subject to review, the impact of this action will not be significant. For most
projects subject to this review, a ground water impact assessment will be required pursuant to other federal laws,
such as the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Integration of those related reviews with Sole Source Aquifer review will allow EPA and other federal agencies to
avoid delay or duplication of effort in approving financial assistance, thus minimizing any adverse effect on those
small entities which are affected. Finally, today's action does not prevent grants of Federal financial assistance
which may be available to any affected small entity in order to pay for the redesign of the project to assure protection
of the aquifer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the
requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This regulation is not significant because it will not have an annual
effect of $100 million or more on the economy, will not cause any major increase in costs or prices, and will not have
significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability
of United States enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets. This action only affects the area within the
boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. As a result of this action, no commitment of Federal financial assistance
(through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator
determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health,
but a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into
to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer.

Meeting Held To Discuss Role of Cable in Proposed Changes to the Emergency Broadcast System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
April 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Communications Commission is nearing completion of a rulemaking proceeding to modernize the present
Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), Docket FO 91&hyph;171 and FO 91&hyph;301. One of the areas under consideration
is the inclusion of cable television systems as an equal partner with broadcast stations in a new emergency alerting
system. On Wednesday, April 27, 1994, members of the Commission staff met in Washington, DC with some of the cable television
equipment manufacturers and cable operators that had filed comments in the docket on the integration of cable systems
into an alerting system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the meeting was to attempt to clarify and further document the estimated costs of emergency alerting
equipment in cable systems. Such costs include the purchase of equipment, and the operation of such an alerting system
over the multi-channel cable systems. While the discussions centered upon comments already filed with the Commission,
it was hoped that this further discussion would enhance the Commission's understanding of the nuances and details
for cable implementation of an alerting system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An audio recording of the meeting was made and has been placed in the record as a part of the official proceeding in the
docket. The public and all interested parties are invited to review this recording which consists of approximately
six hours of discussion by the approximately 25 participants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 For continued operation of nuclear power plants, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires approved licensee
and State and local governments' radiological emergency response plans. In support of the Federal requirement for
emergency response plans, 44 CFR 350, Review and Approval of State and Local Radiological Emergency Plans and Preparedness,
describes its procedures for review and approval of State and local governments' radiological emergency response
plans. Pursuant to 44 CFR 350.7, Application by State for Review and Approval, the State of Oregon submitted its Radiological
Emergency Plan for the State of Oregon and Affected Counties to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region X
Office, for review and approval under 44 CFR part 350.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included are radiological emergency response plans for local governments that are wholly or partially within the
plume exposure pathway emergency planning zones of the WNP&hyph;2 Nuclear Power Plant. The Manual covers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Oregon's WNP&hyph;2 Emergency Response Plan, dated December 1993,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Oregon's Hanford Emergency Response Plan, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Guidelines the State of Oregon, Morrow County, and Umatilla County will use to implement the plans in a WNP&hyph;2
and Hanford emergency. Oregon is not requesting FEMA review of the Oregon Hanford Plan section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the Manual are available for review and copying at the FEMA Region X Office, or they will be made available

Mellon Bank Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (applicant), has applied pursuant to Section 4(c)(8) of the
Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and &sect;225,23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23)
to acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the voting securities of the following directly or indirectly held subsidiaries
of the Dreyfus Corporation, New York, New York (Dreyfus):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Dreyfus Security Savings Bank, F.S.B., Paramus, New Jersey (DSSB), a federal savings bank (insured by the
FDIC, Bank Insurance Fund), and thereby engage in operating a savings association pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(9);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Dreyfus Trust Company, Uniondale, New York (DTC), a trust company holding a limited purpose charter from the
New York Department of Banking, and thereby engage in operating a trust company pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(3);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Dreyfus Realty Advisors, Inc., New York, New York and Atlanta, Georgia (DRA), and thereby engage in certain investment
advisory activities related to the acquisition, management, and disposition of real estate and real estate-related
investments (DRA also has 21 wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries, each of which acts as a managing general partner
in certain real estate limited or general partnerships); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Truepenny Corporation, New York, New York (Truepenny), a holding company for the Trotwood Corporation (Trotwood),
New York, New York, and thereby engage in certain community development initiatives and, with two of their subsidiaries
and through several partnerships, in a real estate development project in New York City, known as the Queens West Redevelopment
Project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Dreyfus Partnership Management, Inc., New York, New York (DPM), and thereby serve as a non-managing general partner
of two mutual funds organized as limited partnerships which are sponsored, advised and managed by Dreyfus;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Major Trading Corporation, New York, New York (MTC), and thereby engage primarily in investing in securities,
including shares of certain mutual funds advised by Dreyfus-affiliates; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Dreyfus Acquisition Corporation, New York, New York (DAC), and thereby engage in making equity and debt investments,
including investments in certain mutual funds advised by Dreyfus-affiliates and in certain limited partnerships.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant proposes to acquire the above companies simultaneously with the proposed acquisition of Dreyfus by its
subsidiary, Mellon Bank, N.A., which has filed a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding
such proposed acquisition of Dreyfus. Applicant proposes to acquire DSSB, DTC, DRA, DPM, MTC, and DAC through a wholly
owned subsidiary, MBC Investments Corporation (MBC), and to acquire Truepenny directly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweight possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form.

activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding
Regulation Y (49 FR 806, January 6, (1984).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities of the subsidiaries that Applicant proposes to acquire can reasonably be expected
to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that
outweight possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit
the public by enabling Applicant to provide a broader range of services to its customers and thereby enhance Applicant's
ability to compete and expand its participation in the investment advisory business. Applicant also believes that
the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.

The Board has previously determined in &sect;&sect;225.25(b)(9) and 225.25(b)(3) of Regulation Y that the operation
of a savings association and a trust company, respectively, are activities closely related to banking and permissible
for bank holding companies. Applicant states that DSSB and DTC will be operated in accordance with these sections.
DSSB operates out of a principal office in Paramus, New Jersey, has a branch office in San Francisco, California, and
has received approval from the Office of Thrift Supervision to open 13 additional interstate offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant asserts that DRA's real estate-related investment activities are permissible under &sect;225.25(b)(4)
of Regulation Y. Applicant has committed that DRA will cease to engage in any activities that are impermissible for
bank holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries and that all subsidiaries of DRA will cease to engage in impermissible
activities or be divested within 2 years after consummation of the proposed transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Applicant, the direct and indirect investments of Truepenny and Trotwood are authorized under &sect;225.25(b)(6)
of Regulation Y as equity and debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community
welfare. Applicant asserts that the Queens West Redevelopment Project is designed to make affordable housing available
to persons of lower middle income and will create significant employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income
communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant contends that its proposed investments in DPM, MTC and DAC are authorized under section 4(c)(7) of the BHC
Act, which permits bank holding companies to acquire shares of investment companies that engage solely in acquiring
5 percent or less of the securities of other companies. With respect to the role of DPM as non-managing general partner
to 2 mutual funds, Applicant claims that DPM engages only in investment activity permitted by section 4(c)(7) of the
BHC Act and that the managing general partners have complete and exclusive control over the management, conduct and
operation of the funds' business. Applicant commits to reduce any investment of DPM, MTC and DAC to below the 5% threshold
in section 4(c)(7) of the BHC Act, including limited partnership interests that qualify as voting securities under
&sect;225.2(p) of Regulation Y.

Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than May 30, 1994. Any request for a hearing
on this application must, as required by &sect;262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as implemented by the Council
on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and the General Services Administration (GSA)
guidelines PBS P 1095.4B, GSA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announce their intent to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the acquisition of 350 to 400 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland for the construction
of 2.1 million occupiable square feet (osf) of office and laboratory space for use by the FDA to house approximately
5,645 employees with 5,415 parking spaces. Acquisition of this site and construction of this facility will provide
one of three campuses planned to allow FDA to consolidate its facilities. FDA is located in three buildings within
the District of Columbia and 35 buildings in Maryland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1994, GSA advertised for expressions of interest from potential offerors to provide the required site. The
site is to accommodate the construction of a campus for the Headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration. The list
of sites that will be considered as alternatives in the EIS are as follows (not listed in order of preference):

The EIS will focus on the Government's programmatic needs and potential short and long-term impacts that may result
from new construction. The consulting firms of Leo A. Daly and Greenhorne &amp; O'Mara have been retained to prepare
the draft and final EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to this proposed action. A public scoping meeting will be held on May 16, 1994, at 7 p.m.
at Rockville High School, 2100 Baltimore Road, Rockville Maryland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A short, formal presentation will precede the request for public comments. GSA and FDA representatives will be available
at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern. It is important that Federal, State,
and County Agencies, interested individuals, and groups take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns
and significant issues that should be addressed by the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be
asked to limit their oral comments to five (5) minutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies and the general public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu
of, comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues
or topics which the commentator believes the EIS should address. Written statements concerning the alternatives
should be postmarked no later than June 6, 1994, to Mr. Andrew Dempster, Planning Staff (WPL) room 7618, National Capital
Region, General Services Administration, Room 7618, 7th and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC, 20407, Telephone (202)&hyph;708&hyph;5530.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Emphasis Panel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dates and Times: May 3&hyph;4, 1994, 9:00 A.M.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ambassador 1 Room, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bethesda, Maryland 20814. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This meeting will be closed to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purpose: The Panel's charge is to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary and to the Administrator, Agency
for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), regarding the scientific and technical merit of contract proposals
submitted in response to a specific Request for Proposals (PHS 94&hyph;2). The purpose of this contract, entitled
Consumer Choices and Health Care Reform, is to develop a prototype decision support system, workbook, interactive
video, or other tools for consumers to use in selecting health care plans, providers, and practitioners. The prototype
should focus on one area of decision-making, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e.g., evaluation of preventative health services. The final product should have the capacity to be adapted for new
categories of choices related to a reformed system of health care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agenda: The session of this Panel will be devoted entirely to the technical review and evaluation of contract proposals
submitted in response to a specific Request for Proposals. The Administrator, AHCPR, has made a formal determination
that this meeting will not be open to the public. This is necessary to protect the free exchange of views and avoid undue
interference with Panel and Department operations, and safeguard confidential proprietary information and personal
information concerning individuals associated with the proposals that may be revealed during the sessions. This
is in accordance with section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. Appendix 2, Department regulations,
45 CFR 11.5(a)(6), and procurement regulations, 48 CFR 315.604(d).

Seven of every 1,000 ten-year old children suffer from mild mental retardation, and three of every 1,000 suffer from
more serious mental retardation. Poor children, especially those whose mothers have less than a high school education,
are at risk of cognitive delay of as much as one standard deviation of IQ (15 points) at age three. Studies such as the
Infant Health and Development Program and the Carolina Abecedarian Project have proven that an intensive early health
and development intervention can prevent or reduce as much as two-thirds of PAMR. CDC is actively involved in research
and planning to help States develop a community-based program to prevent PAMR.

 of January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2413), FDA announced that on January 31, 1994, the agency would be holding a public workshop
on possible improvements in the DMF system, especially Type II DMF's, which concern drug substances, drug substance
intermediates, and materials used in their preparation, or drug products. The workshop focused on alternative ways
for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to review Type II DMF's for drug substances and intermediates.
The agency announced that it would accept data, information, or views on this subject until March 14, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) requested that FDA extend the comment period for an
additional 60 days. IPEC explained that several of its members could not attend the public workshop because of a scheduling
conflict with the U.S. Pharmacopeia's Second Open Conference on Excipient Harmonization and that the members are
reviewing the transcript and summary of the workshop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of reopening the comment period is to provide an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments
for review by CDER in considering possible improvements in the DMF system. FDA believes that reopening the comment
period until June 3, 1994, provides sufficient opportunity to comment on the workshop transcript and summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before June 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Title X of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to public or private nonprofit entities
to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects to provide a broad range of acceptable
and effective family planning methods and services (including natural family planning methods, infertility services,
and services for adolescents). The statute requires that, to the extent practicable, entities shall encourage family
participation. Also, Title X funds may not be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. Implementing
regulations appear at 42 CFR part 59 subpart A.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 5, 1993, HHS published at 58 FR 7462 an interim rule that suspends the 1988 Title X rules (popularly known
as the ``Gag Rule''), pending the promulgation of new regulations. The principle effect of this action was to suspend
the definitions of ``family planning,'' ``grantees,'' ``prenatal care,'' ``Title X,'' ``Title X Program,'' and
``Title X Project'' presently found at 42 CFR 59.2 and 42 CFR 59.7&hyph;59.10. Proposed rules were also published
at 58 FR 7464 on the same date. During the pendency of rulemaking, the compliance standards that were in effect prior
to the issuance of the 1988 rule, including those set out in the 1981 Family Planning Guidelines, will be used to administer
the program. Copies of the pre-1988 compliance standards are available from the Regional Program Consultants listed
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Title X program has established these five priorities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Expansion of current clinic sites and development of new clinics in high-need areas;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Outreach to low-income women, adolescents and persons at high risk of unintended pregnancy or infection with
STD (including HIV) not now receiving family planning services;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Increased emphasis on services to adolescents, including enhanced counseling as well as new service arrangements
for providing services to teens;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Increased focus on quality and comprehensiveness of services, including treatment of STDs, screening for cervical
and breast cancer, substance abuse counseling, and counseling on avoidance of high risk behavior which may place
clients at risk for STD and HIV; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Increased emphasis on training and retention of family planning nurse practitioners, particularly minority
nurse practitioners and those working in clincis serving high-need populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These program priorities represent overriding goals which are being pursued to the extent that funding increases
or increases in program efficiency allow. Some funding may be available to Title X grantees to improve and expand services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration's FY 1995 budget request for this program is $199 million. This amount represents a 10 percent
increase over the appropriation for FY 1994 of $181 million, of which $168 million will be made available to Title X
service grantees. Approximately 16 percent of the funds appropriated for FY 1995 and made available to Title X service
grantees will be used for competing grants. The remaining funds will be used for non-competing continuation grants.
This program announcement is subject to the appropriation of funds and is a contingency action being taken to ensure
that, should funds become available for this purpose, they can be awarded in a timely fashion consistent with the needs
of the program as well as to provide for the distribution of funds throughout the fiscal year. Since the precise funding
levels for FY 1995 are uncertain at this point, the funding levels set out below are based on the FY 1993 appropriation
level. However, it is expected that funding levels will be increased if the appropriation for FY 1995 increases.

Approximately $168 million will be awarded nationwide during FY 1994 for Title X services. The entire $168 million
will be allocated among the 10 DHHS regions, and will be in turn awarded to public and private non-profit agencies located
within the regions. Each regional office is responsible for evaluating applications, establishing priorities,
and setting funding levels according to criteria in 42 CFR 59.11.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is publishing this notice to provide information to the public of its
intent to award a competing renewal MFP grant award to the American Psychological Association for the clinical training
of psychology students who are ethnic minorities for entry into service careers in mental and addictive health areas.
The project period for the competing renewal grant is anticipated to be three years. The first year's award will be
approximately $266,000. This is not a general request for applications. The competitive renewal clinical training
grant will only be made to the American Psychological Association.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The award will be made under the authority of section 303 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. The authority to administer
this program has been delegated to the Director, CMHS. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this
program is 93.244.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
BACKGROUND: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
CMHS has the responsibility for mental health workforce development, including the clinical training of mental
health professionals concerned with the treatment of underserved priority populations: Seriously mentally ill
adults; seriously emotionally disturbed children; and elderly, ethnic minorities and rural populations with mental
disorders; and individuals with co-occurring mental and addictive disorders. CMHS also has responsibility for
training ethnic minorities to become mental health professionals, which is a very significant task in light of the
gap between the growing ethnic minority populations requiring mental health services (approaching 25% of the total
population) and the much smaller number of ethnic minority mental health professionals (less than 10% of the total).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past several decades, the Federal mental health clinical training program at NIMH (and currently at CMHS)
has addressed this gap primarily by attempting to increase the numbers of ethnic minority professionals. Ethnic
minority professionals understand the customs and language of their own particular ethnic group and, therefore,
are more likely to render high-quality mental health services to mentally ill minorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CMHS MFP is designed to facilitate the entry of minority students into mental health careers. The long-term goal
is to increase the number of professionals trained at the doctoral level to teach and provide mental health services,
especially to ethnic minority groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MFP was started at NIMH in the 1970s. This program for clinical training provides grants to each of the four core
mental health professional organizations: The American Nurses Association, the American Psychological Association,
the American Psychiatric Association, and the Council on Social Work Education. These 4 MFP grantees, in turn, conduct
national competitions to make individual graduate fellowship awards to minority students throughout the country.
Each of the four professional organizations has unique access to those students entering its profession. Each of
the four has recruited the best students, assured that all program requirements were satisfied, and monitored the
progress of fellows during and after the fellowship period. In short, there has been no reason to change the program
structure or the grantees administering the four-discipline program; thus, the mechanism of peer-reviewed competing
renewal clinical training grant has been appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, because the American Psychological Association's MFP grant support will end in FY 1994, the CMHS is providing
additional support for up to three years via a competing renewal grant award. The American Nurses Association, the
American Psychiatric Association and the Council on Social Work Education have ongoing CMHS MFP grant support.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Resource management planning for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered lands is governed by regulations
in 43 CFR 1610.2(b). These regulations require that the BLM publish a planning schedule advising the public of the
status of resource management plans (RMP's) in preparation. Projected new RMP starts for the three succeeding fiscal
years are also identified to provide the public an opportunity to comment on the projected planning schedule and aid
in the coordination of the schedule with other agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A limited number of new starts for RMP's are projected. There are currently 34 RMP efforts underway (not including
amendments and revisions). It is forecasted that 11 of the RMP's will be completed in fiscal year 1994 and an additional
11 will be completed in fiscal year 1995. These efforts are having a significant effect on BLM capability to initiate
new RMP's and complete maintenance/monitoring and implementation of the existing RMP's.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon completion of a major portion of the current ongoing RMP's, the BLM will start a limited number of new RMP's or RMP
revisions within its current capability. A priority ranking system will be utilized to allocate the limited new planning
efforts. New RMP starts for fiscal year 1994 include Snake River/Deep Creek RMP (Idaho). New starts for 1995 include
Malheur/Jordan RMP (Oregon) and Price RMP (Utah). New starts for 1996 include Andrews RMP (Oregon) and Winnemuca/Surprise
(Nevada). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planning process begins with the publication of a Notice of Intent to initiate an RMP. A public notice and and an
opportunity for participation in each RMP are provided as required by the regulations (43 CFR 1610.2(f)). Publication
of the draft RMP and associated draft environmental impact statement as indicated on the schedule is a key opportunity
for public comment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces that it is suspending the review and processing of all future
import permit applications of giant pandas for temporary exhibition and/or captive-breeding loans until it has
completed an evaluation of available information and existing policies and guidelines relating to the import of
giant pandas and has published a new panda policy. This will allow the agency to examine the potential impact of future
imports on the survival of the giant panda. The Service will consider whether, and if so, how such imports into the United
States might contribute to giant panda conservation. Any draft policy or guidelines developed as a result of this
review will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public review and comment. A public working meeting or meetings will be used to assist the Service in formulating
the draft policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The giant panda (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Ailuropoda melanoleuca
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) is subject to U.S. and international protection as a result of its listing as an endangered species under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act and its inclusion in Appendix I to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Section 2(b) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) states that the purposes of the Act
``...are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may
be conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to
take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and conventions set forth in subsection
(a) of this section.'' CITES is one of the Conventions cited in subsection (a) of this statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is responsible for deciding whether to issue import and export permits required by the Act and CITES for
giant panda loans. Therefore, the Service must determine whether the purposes for such imports influence the continued
existence of giant pandas in the wild. The Service believes that existing regulations and policy, including its March
14, 1991 ``Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits'' (56 FR 10809) have been sufficient for individual panda import permit
decisions made to date. However, there is the possibility that an increasing number of import permits for numerous
pandas will be sought for captive breeding purposes in the United States in the near future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before any import permit will be granted, it must be reviewed in terms of the application requirements of CITES and
the Act by the Service's Offices of Management and Scientific Authorities. Issuance of an import permit under CITES
requires prior findings that: (1) the proposed import would not be for purposes detrimental to the survival of the
species; (2) the import would not be for primarily commercial purposes; and (3) the permit applicant is suitably equipped
to house and care for the animal(s). Issuance of a permit under the Act requires prior determinations that, among other
things: (1) the import would be for scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the species in
a manner consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act; and (2) issuance of the import permit would not be likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. These requirements are further implemented by application
requirements and issuance criteria found in 50 CFR 13.12, 17.22, 23.14, and 23.15. With regard to making the first
finding listed above under both CITES and the Endangered Species Act, the issue is whether the detrimental effects
that might result from a loan would be sufficiently offset by specific enhancement features to allow a determination
that the import would be for purposes that are not detrimental and that would, in fact, enhance the survival of the species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Service was processing a previous application to import a pair of giant pandas for a temporary exhibition
loan, the CITES Secretariat requested that the Service reevaluate its ``Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits'' for
temporary exhibition loans. Therefore, the Service published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 29, 1992 (57 FR 28825), requesting public comments on this policy. Before this evaluation was completed, the
Service received additional applications for the import of giant pandas for purposes other than for temporary exhibition
loans, and determined the need for additional review and comment, resulting in this notice. To date, comments received
have not been incorporated into any revision of its existing policy, since such comments only were solicited on temporary
exhibition loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 19, 1993, the Service received an application from the Zoological Society of San Diego to import a pair
of giant pandas for a captive-breeding loan. Shortly afterwards, on April 20, 1993, the American Zoo and Aquarium
Association (AZA) announced the development of a Giant Panda Conservation Action Plan, which currently includes
approximately 29 zoological institutions that have agreed to participate in a giant panda captive-breeding program
in North America.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that there are fewer than 1000 giant pandas remaining in the wild in scattered and isolated populations,
and that approximately 100 are held in captivity. Conservation of the giant panda appears to involve two broad areas
of activities: habitat protection, management and expansion; and the captive breeding of animals with the ultimate
goal of reintroductions into available habitat. The primary concerns associated with individual giant panda import
permit applications are: (1) the potential for stimulating the unwarranted removal of additional pandas from the
wild; (2) the need for a clear connection between imports and conservation activities for giant pandas; (3) the need
to ensure that imports will not disrupt or defer existing captive-breeding efforts; and (4) the potential for planned
captive-breeding efforts in the U.S. to maximize the probability of enhancing international captive-breeding
efforts. With the possibility of receiving an increased number of import permit applications for giant pandas for
public exhibition and/or captive breeding purposes, the Service feels that a re-examination of the long-range implications
of panda imports is necessary to further ensure that such imports best serve the conservation needs of the species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these rapidly developing events and the increased interest in a coordinated captive-breeding program
for the giant panda, the Service has decided to suspend the review and processing of future permit applications for
the import of giant pandas until it has had an opportunity to evaluate additional and pertinent information on the
subject, and has developed, if necessary, new policy or guidelines for the issuance of import permits for giant pandas.
During this moratorium the Service will evaluate the potential effects of further loans on the survival of the giant
panda, including the cumulative impacts of an anticipated increase in the number of import permit applications from
U.S. institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the review process, the Service will convene a public working meeting on May 26, 1994, (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice), and perhaps additional meetings, to provide active participation in the process of developing
a proposed policy. The meeting will provide an opportunity for discussion of specific topics presented below. Interested
organizations and individuals that cannot participate in the meeting may submit comments on these issues to the address
given above (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section) by June 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, at appropriate times during the review the Service will engage in direct discussions with representatives
of the government of the People's Republic of China, and with the Secretariat of CITES in Geneva, Switzerland. Such
discussions will be designed to ensure full understanding of the respective policies and goals of each country for
implementation of CITES in general and for panda conservation in particular.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends to complete the review and development of any necessary new policy or guidelines as quickly as
possible. Interested organizations and the public are invited to comment on the existing need for new policy or guidance
for the evaluation of giant panda import permit applications in the future, to suggest criteria that should be included
or considered when developing new policy or guidance, and to suggest any other issues relative to giant panda conservation
that the Service should consider during this review. Suggested criteria should take into account the necessary applicability
of the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and CITES regarding permit issuance. Any draft policy or guidelines
developed as a result of this review will be published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 20, 1993, the Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of violations of section
337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, in the misappropriation of trade secrets and trade dress, infringement of
federally-registered trademarks, false designation of origin and passing off in the importation, the sale for importation,
and the sale within the United States after importation, of certain removable hard disk cartridges.

On March 16, 1994, complainant Syquest Technology, Inc. filed a motion to terminate the investigation as to respondent
Srinivisan V. Chari pursuant to 19 CFR 210.51(a). (Motion 351 24). On March 17, 1994, Syquest and respondents Nomai,
S.A., Iomega Corporation, Marc Frouin, and Herve Frouin filed a joint motion to terminate the investigation on the
basis of a Memorandum of Understanding and a Settlement Agreement (Motion 351&hyph;26). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 23, 1994, the Commission investigative attorney (``IA'') filed a response in support of the Motion 351&hyph;24,
and a response in support of Motion 351&hyph;26, contingent upon the parties' filing a more complete public version
of their MOU. The IA concluded that Motion 351&hyph;26 met the requirements for termination based upon a settlement
agreement, and that the settlement agreement does not appear contrary to the public interest. On April 5, 1994, the
ALJ issued an ID granting both motions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No petitions for review, or agency or public comments were received.

Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) has filed a petition to reject the notices of exemption and the United Transportation
Union (UTU) has filed a petition to revoke the notices of exemption and a motion to stay the transaction. BLE argues
that the notices should be rejected because the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the transaction in Finance
Docket No. 32481, as it involves yard operations which are exempt under 49 U.S.C. 10907 and not operations over a line
of railroad under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR 1150.1. UTU argues that the exemption in Finance Docket No. 32481 should
be revoked, alleging that this is a sham transaction to avoid Commission regulation and labor protective conditions
under 49 U.S.C. 11343. These issues will be addressed in a separate decision.

GWI also directly controls eight existing class III common carriers by rail: the Allegheny &amp; Eastern Railroad,
Inc., the Bradford Industrial Rail, Inc., Buffalo &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., the Dansville and Mount Morris
Railroad, the Louisiana &amp; Delta Railroad, Inc., the Rochester &amp; Southern Railroad, Inc., and the Willamette
&amp; Pacific Railroad, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GWI indicates that: (1) The rail lines to be acquired and operated will not connect with any of GWI's rail subsidiaries;
(2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads
with each other or any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier.
The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By a decision served February 11, 1993, the Commission instituted an oversight plan that allows us to monitor effectively
the competitive results of Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation's (WCTC) continuance in control of Fox
Valley and Western Ltd. (FV&amp;W).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As detailed in the decision, the oversight covers 5 years and contains five elements: Notification of shippers, reporting
by applicants, discussion with selected parties, proceeding, and staff report. Commission staff has been actively
monitoring the transaction since its consummation on August 28, 1993.

This transaction was approved by decision served December 10, 1992, which was corrected by a decision served December
22, 1992. See Wisc. Central Transportation Corporation, et al., 9 I.C.C.2d 233 (1992). On December 30, 1992, Chicago
and North Western Transportation Company (CNW) petitioned the Commission to reopen the proceeding. CNW argued that
the Commission materially erred in its competitive impact analysis and in its failure to impose any of CNW's proposed
remedial conditions. By decision served July 23, 1993, the petition to reopen was denied. See Wisc. Central Transportation
Corporation, et al., 9 I.C.C.2d 730 (1993).

on appropriate conditions to remedy any substantial anticompetitive effects. This proceeding is a fact-finding
mechanism and will not necessarily result in a formal ruling.

The entire meeting will be open to public attendance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda for the subject meeting shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Monday, May 16, 1994&hyph;8:30 a.m. until the conclusion of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACNW will revisit this subject, which was originally addressed in an October 17, 1991 Working Group Meeting. Progress
in the NRC's Iterative Performance Assessment (PA) Program, the NRC staff's total system performance assessment
(TPA), the evolution of the reliance on expert elicitation, and progress made in the execution of the NRC's modular
computer model will be subjects of interest to the Committee. This review will be performed periodically to determine
the degree of in-house and contractor-supported PA capability, the coordination and integration between data analyst
and computer modelers, revisions to the High-Level Radioactive Waste Management PA Strategy Plan, and future direction
of Phase 3 for PA development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oral statements may be presented by members of the public with the concurrence of the ACNW Working Group Chairman;
written statements will be accepted and made available to the Working Group. Electronic recordings will be permitted
only during those portions of the meeting that are open to the public, and questions may be asked only by members of the
Working Group, its consultants, and staff. Persons desiring to make oral statements should notify the ACNW staff
member named below five days prior to the meeting, if possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the initial portion of the meeting, the ACNW Working Group, along with any of its consultants who may be present,
may exchange preliminary views regarding matters to be considered during the balance of the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACNW Working Group will then hear presentations by and hold discussions with representatives of the NRC staff
and their consultants, national laboratories, state officials, and other interested parties, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;21, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to change the laboratory testing protocol
for the charcoal absorbers for the Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (TS 3.7.6.1) and the Enclosure Building
Filtration System (TS 3.6.5.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the present TS requires a test on carbon samples of charcoal absorbers that the licensee's vendor had not and
could not perform, the TS must be changed to allow testing of carbon samples to a standard that is more accurate and capable
of performance. The plant is presently operating and during a review of the recent ventilation system testing, the
licensee's Quality Services Department discovered a discrepancy in the references identified in the vendor test
procedure as compared to the Millstone Unit 2 TS requirements. Further, on April 12, 1994, the licensee discovered
that the vendor's test equipment could not support the laboratory test required by the testing standard currently
referenced in the Millstone Unit No. 2 TS. The inplace charcoal for the ``B'' facilities of the Control Room Emergency
Ventilation System and the Enclosure Building Ventilation System were conservatively determined to be inoperable
because the surveillance performed on these units had been satisfied utilizing a standard (ASTM Standard D3803&hyph;79/86)
not specified in the Millstone Unit 2 TS. Thus the licensee immediately declared the affected facilities inoperable
and entered the 7 day action statement. The action statements require the affected systems to be restored to an operable
status within 7 days or the plant be placed in at least hot standby within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within
the following 30 hours. Due to the fact that the time necessary to process the application for amendment would be longer
than the remaining time of the 7 day action statement, exigent action is justified in order to reduce the time of enforcement
discretion which was granted until the license amendment is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to revise Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2., 4.6.5.1.c, 4.7.6.1.c.2,
4.7.6.1.d, 4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c will permit carbon samples to be tested in accordance with ASTM D3803&hyph;89
versus ANSI N509&hyph;1976. ASTM Standard D3803&hyph;89 is used industry wide, and is acknowledged by the NRC as
an acceptable method for the testing of activated charcoal bed filters. In addition, testing in accordance with ASTM
Standard D3803&hyph;89 yields more accurate results than testing in accordance with ANSI N509&hyph;1976. The removal
efficiency requirement is not affected by the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is
an editorial correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2, 4.6.5.1.c, 4.7.6.1.c.2, 4.7.6.1.d,
4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c do not involve any physical modifications to any equipment, structures, or components,
nor do they involve any changes to any plant operating procedures. The only change would be to use a more reliable method
to determine filter efficiency at the laboratory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory Position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is
an editorial correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2, 4.6.5.1.c, 4.6.5.1.c.2, 4.7.6.1.d,
4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c do not modify the requirement for carbon sample removal efficiency, do not involve a change
in any safety limits, setpoints, or design margins, and do not affect any protective boundaries. Additionally, the
proposed methodology has been determined to be more accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory Position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is
an editorial correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By June 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or
petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in providing
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

Meridan National Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on October 25,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the BSE. The Company's Common Stock will continue to be
traded in the over-the-counter market. The decision of the Board was based upon belief that listing of the Company
on the BSE was not beneficial to its stockholders in that there was little or no activity in the Company's Common Stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before May 19, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

supplementary information:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the California Toll Road
Company (CTRC) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a toll-operated highway
facility in a corridor between Route 4 and Route 84 in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, a distance of approximately
48-kilometers (30 miles). The proposed facility would consist generally of a divided limited access roadway. It
is anticipated that majority of the roadway will be located on new alignment. Major roadways in the area are presently
operating at peak hour levels of service (LOS) D to F, and are expected to decline to LOS F before the year 2010. There
are also problems with the regional movement of freight on local roads because of the lack of regional transportation
facilities.

NHTSA requests suggestions from interested parties on the specific agenda topics. NHTSA will base its decisions
about the agenda, in part, on the suggestions it receives by close of business at 4:15 p.m. on May 18, 1994. Before the
meeting, it will publish a notice with an agenda listing the research and development topics to be discussed. NHTSA
asks that the suggestions be taken from the list below and that they be limited to five, in priority order, so that the
presentations at the June 14 R&amp;D meeting can be most useful to the audience. Please note that almost all of these
topics have been discussed at the previous five meetings to some extent and that presentations at the sixth meeting
will be reports on current status, results, and plans.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Information Agency (USIA) invites applications from eligible institutions under the auspices
of the North-South Center's 1994 Research Grant Programs. The North-South Center is located at the University of
Miami and is funded through a Congressional appropriation managed through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs of the United States Information Agency. The Center's External Research Grant Program and Short-Term Field
Research Program support selected research activities which are of importance to the people and governments of the
Western Hemisphere. Through grant awards, the Center brings together human and technical resources to address major
themes relevant to policy making in North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean. The Grant Programs provide
funding for research projects with innovative approaches to contemporary concerns throughout the region. There
are currently two grant competitions for which solicitation of research proposals is being sought:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals from all parts of the world, except where prohibited by U.S. law that are consistent with the mission of the
North-South Center and are of sound intellectual justification will be considered. Funding will not be authorized
for any private for-profit institutions, profit-oriented individuals' initiatives, projects of a proprietary
nature, or for projects of a partisan political nature. Principal investigators should have completed advanced
degrees and must demonstrate an institutional affiliation. Pre and post doctoral scholars are eligible to complete
for the Short-term Field Research Grants on Poverty and Urban Violence, however the investigators must demonstrate
an institutional affiliation. The Center and its Grant Review Panel will not use political tests or political qualifications
and will not discriminate in any manner whatsoever in selecting grantees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funding Limitations: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grant awards should not be used in lieu of salary or to support projects which could be funded by private foundations
or government. In addition, applicants are encouraged to seek supplemental funding for projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successful projects will be funded by means of a cost reimbursement subcontract agreement between the North-South
Center, the University of Miami, and the applicant's institution. All current policies and requirements that govern
federal research grants will be applied to the grant award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs authorizing legislation, programs must maintain
a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Research Grant Program: North-South Center External Research Grant Awards will be capped at $50,000. Multi-year
proposals will be funded on a yearly basis upon recommendation of the Grant Review Panel, contingent upon Congressional
funding of the North-South Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Short-term Field Research Grant Program on Poverty and Urban Violence: The maximum award for this program will be
$20,000. Support will include international travel expenses, domestic transportation, limited living expenses,
and research and pre-publication expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overview_The general aim of the North-South Center's grant programs is to promote scholarly research that will increase
knowledge and broaden understanding of contemporary regional issues. The long-term aims of the programs are to support
scholarship in inter-American affairs, encourage collaboration in various fields of research among institutions
throughout the hemisphere, stimulate discussion of policy-relevant issues, and promote scholarship from which
policy solutions may derive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines_The Center gives priority to projects involving the collaboration of institutions in more than one country
and to projects addressing issues encompassing several countries. The Programs provide funding for projects that
demonstrate a clear analytical focus, a solid method to achieve research goals in a timely manner, and relevance to
contemporary policy. Research activities should generate a product of enduring value such as a publication or a series
of publications.

Proposed Budget_Applicants must submit a comprehensive line item budget for which specific details are available
in the application packet. The Center does not pay for costs that are not directly related to the specific project being
funded (e.g., indirect costs). No support will be given for the purchase or lease of capital equipment (e.g., fax machines,
computers), or other related infrastructural costs. Some degree of institutional support should be reflected in
the proposed project budget. Salary support must be fully justified by the specific requirements of the projects
and should not represent a major portion of total project expense. Salary support should be calculated as a percentage
of time spent on research for the duration of the project. It is not permissible to request support in lieu of responsibilities
for university course instruction.

review every proposal for eligibility, completeness, and competitiveness. Outside reviewers with expertise in
a particular subject area may be called upon to provide critique on proposals. Proposals will be deemed ineligible
if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet. All eligible and complete
proposals will be submitted to the Center's Grant Review Panel, comprised of a multidisciplinary group of distinguished
experts from major university centers for Latin American and Caribbean Studies throughout the United States and
two international business members.
